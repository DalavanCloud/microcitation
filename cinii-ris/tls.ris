N2  - Light irradiation stimulates blue coloration in the band region of the adult wing of a butterfly, Graphium sarpedon whereas the region remains yellow in darkness. This blue color is due to the presence of a blue bilin pigment (sarpedobilin). In the present study, we show that the amount of blue bilin in the wing band region increases with increasing intensity or duration of light exposure. Further, blue bilin accumulation occurs when local irradiation of light falls on the wing, but not on the adult body. This remained true even when only the wing separated from an adult body or only the limited region of the wing band pattern was exposed to light. Blue light is more effective than green or red light. Microscopic observations show that the blue coloration is derived from part of the wing membrane, but not from wing scales. These results strongly suggest that light acts directly on the wing tissue without the intervention of a neuroendocrine system, and increases the amount of blue bilin in the wing membrane.

N2  - This short note demonstrates the morphological evidence of male-specific size reduction of head capsule width during the last larval instar of the bagworm moth Eumeta variegata (Snellen, 1879). In this species, sexual dimorphism appears in the last larval stage, with the male larvae being smaller than female larvae. Head capsule width in the female increases after the last larval molt, while in the male head capsule width is reduced in the last larval instar. These results show that the reduction of the epicranial plate causes the size reduction of head capsules during the last larval instar in males. This is the first description of the process of the male-specific size reduction of head capsule width in lepidopteran insects during the last larval molt.

N2  - Actias selene Hubner, an indigenous vanya silk moth is trivoltine in nature and undergoes 97.6±4.37 days winter pupal hibernation in the climatic conditions of Nagaland, India. The worm is polyphagous in nature and feeds on six host plants, among which rearing was conducted on two host plants, namely, Alnus nepalensis (Alder) and Rhus javanica (Tangmo) in three rearing seasons (March-May, July-August and October-December) for two consecutive years. Each larval instar of A. selene worms has a distinct body colour and tubercular arrangement. On the basis of host plant preference they also exhibit seasonal variation in production parameters (Fecundity, Hatching percentage, ERR percentage and Cocoon/Dfls ratio), life cycle parameters (Duration) and cocoon parameters (Length, Breadth, Weight, Shell weight and Shell ratio). The cocoon has, apparently, no sericultural value, but reelable cocoons with a filament length (mts), filament denier (d) and raw silk recovery (%) of 78.1±4.41-198.82±, 5.09-11.57 and 41.57-58.86% and 86.84±5.40-163.22±8.56, 6.67-8.85 and 35.63-43.32% on Rhus javanica and Alnus nepalensis, respectively, in different rearing seasons are described for the first time.

N2  - Twenty-eight individual larvae of Apochima excavata (Dyar) were found on first and second year saplings of mulberry tree, Morus alba L., during an investigation lasting two years. There were two larval forms. One form (brown form) had a reddish brown area on the dorsal aspect and the other (green form) was entirely green. Female imagines may only be able lay where new saplings appear every year. The reason for the increasing rarity of Apochima excavata is discussed.

It was observed flying over sunny alpine grassland around the pond of Gonoike. It seemed likely that the individual had flown from another area because the food plant was not found in the area. The individual showed features of subspecies sugitanii Esaki with roundness in the wing apex and a narrow black belt on the outside edge etc.

Changes in daily numbers, adult behaviour and morphological characteristics are reported through the comparison between the data of the two years. The emergence of summer form adults in this area is considered to be heavily affected by the amount of snow in winter and the temperature of early summer. Through the observation of this species in 2008, the advantages and disadvantages for summer form emergence are examined.

N2  - The number of individuals of the insect of Lepidoptera was examined by the method of the route-census and the collection by light-trap in the alpine zone (2,342-2,702m) of Mt. Norikura (altitude 3,026m). A total of 169 species (18 families) were collected in the early and late of August, 2009. There was no apparent decrease of the alpine species due to the influence of Global warming. The number of species that go up from the low altitude ground increased. The alpine species will likely experience pressure surviving if low altitude species eat the alpine plant and adjusted to the environment of the alpine region.

N2  - A late-instar larva of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) was found feeding on bread in a residential home in Osaka. The larva may have inadvertently invaded the house, or earlier the grocery store or bakery, to ultimately feed on the bread. The larva was subsequently reared on the bread in the laboratory, but it died before pupation. This occurrence represents a rare case of the infestation of a processed cereal food by a macrolepidopteran caterpillar and the second report of bread-feeding in the cotton bollworm. Helicoverpa armigera caterpillars typically feed on leaves and flowering plant parts, including seeds, and prey on caterpillars. The wide host range and the tendency to feed on proteinous materials of H. armigera may explain this bizarre feeding behavior.

N2  - We conducted transect and quadrat surveys of butterflies in a Satoyama woodland on Mt. Amamori, Inagawa cho, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan from April to October in 2006, to elucidate differences in assemblage structure and species diversity of butterflies in coppices managed at different levels. In the transect survey, 204 individuals of butterflies belonging to 41 species were recorded in the whole transect, and both species richness and density were highest in the section where young Quercus acutissima trees dominated, whereas they were lowest in the section with an abandoned pine forest. In the quadrat survey, a total of 37 individuals belonging to 13 species were recorded, although most of them were recorded from 4 quadrats in coppices dominated by Q. acutissima, and few individuals were observed in quadrats in an abandoned coppice and a pine forest. In coppices, both species richness and density were higher in 2-year coppice quadrats than in 6-year ones. Our results demonstrate that both assemblage structure and species diversity of butterflies are affected by seral stages of vegetation, and traditional coppice management is effective for the conservation of species diversity of butterflies in Satoyama woodlands.

N2  - The Japanese species of the family Bucculatricidae are taxonomically revised and the life histories of each species are investigated. In Japan, in the past only three species, Bucculatrix firmianella Kuroko, 1982, B. pyrivorella Kuroko, 1964, and B. citima Seksjaeva, 1989, had been recorded. We recently described B. hamaboella Kobayashi, Hirowatari & Kuroko, 2009 (Kobayashi et al., 2009) and recorded B. comporabile Seksjaeva, 1989 and B. demaryella (Duponchel, 1840) from Japan (Arita et al., 2009). In this study, a total of 23 species of the genus Bucculatrix Zeller were recorded from 18 different plant species belonging to 10 plant families. Four new species, B. muraseae sp. nov. (Host: Alnus japonica, Betulaceae), B. serratella sp. nov. (Host: Zelkova serrata, Ulmaceae), B. kogii sp. nov. (Host: Unknown), and B. tsurubamella sp. nov. (Host: Quercus acutissima, Fagaceae) are described. Eleven species, B. splendida Seksjaeva, 1992, B. laciniatella Benander, 1931, B. maritima Stainton, 1851, B. notella Seksjaeva, 1996, B. nota Seksjaeva, 1989, B. sinevi Seksjaeva, 1988, B. altera Seksjaeva, 1989, B. armata Seksjaeva, 1989, B. univoca Meyrick, 1918, B. thoracella (Thunberg, 1794), and B. cidarella (Zeller, 1839) are newly recorded from Japan. Bucculatrix sp. 1-4 recorded by Oku (2003) from Iwate Prefecture were also examined. In the course of this study, fifteen species were reared, and the biology of seven species is described for the first time. Sixteen of the Japanese species are grouped into three main types on the basis of larval habits for the first time. The 23 Japanese species are separated into 10 groups based on genital structures, mainly following the species groupings of Braun (1963) and Baryshnikova (2008). Female adults were examined from 18 species in Japan (excluding B. laciniatella, B. nota, and B. kogii). In all examined species, we found that the ductus seminalis is attached to the middle of the corpus bursae, here proposed as an autapomorphy of the genus Bucculatrix.

Leaves that grow in places where the sun often shines all day are firmer and contain more tannin than leaves in places where the sun hardly shines all day. A large number of individuals and species of moth larvae were found on the shade leaves during most seasons. The number of larvae on the sunny leaves only increased in April. The relationship between leaf characteristics and the number of larvae present is discussed.

N2  - The Guatemalan Copper, Iophanus pyrrhias, is found in Guatemala and southern Mexico. There are no closely related species in the Neotropical and Nearctic regions, and therefore it is of interest to study this species from a biogeographical point of view. In order to elucidate the life history of I. pyrrhias, the habits and immature stages were studied on two occasions in the Guatemalan Highlands. We describe the morphology and behaviours of all life stages in the species, and compare our findings with previous notes made and published by earlier researchers. We record Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia, occurring along the Andes in Central and South America, as its hostplant.

N2  - Off-host oviposition of Argyreus hyperbius and Argynnis paphia was investigated. We obtained data on oviposition sites in the caged condition and on predation ratios of eggs exposed to a natural habitat. A. hyperbius oviposited both on and off the host plant with a significantly higher density on it. They laid more eggs on forbs than on dead leaves or stones with a tendency for the number to increase nearer the host plant. A. paphia oviposited at higher levels of the net cage far from the short host plant. As the predation ratio of A. paphia eggs was higher at lower levels, it was hypothesized that this species evolved a habit to oviposit at higher levels to avoid ground predators. For the occasional off-host oviposition by A. hyperbius, possibilities of predation and transition of oviposition habit are discussed.

The eggs are nearly spheroidal with a diameter of approximate 1380μm. Newly deposited eggs are bright yellow and darken before hatching. The micropylar region of the eggshell is somewhat concave, and the micropylar canal opening is surrounded by a rosette of 11 petal-shaped cells. The rest of egg surface was observed to be covered with network patterns made of polygonal imprints of unequal sizes except at the bottom. The junctions of ridges between polygons have distinct aeropyles.

N2  - Overwintering generation larvae of Pelopidas jansonis matured and pupated from early October to mid-December with a peak in late October/early November under outdoor conditions in Tsukuba city, Ibaraki prefecture, central Japan. Overwintering pupae were reared under various constant and fluctuating temperatures superimposed on a photoperiod of 12L:12D (12h light:12h dark) or 15L:9D. The pupal diapause terminated in January. The photoperiod did not have a significant effect on the duration of the pupal stage, but the thermoperiod had a significant effect on the development of pupae. When pupae were kept under fluctuating temperatures, the pupal period was shorter than that at constant temperatures corresponding to the mean of fluctuating temperatures, especially under lower temperature conditions. The developmental zero and the thermal constant of pupae were 13.0-13.3℃ and 158-165 day-degrees and 12.2-12.3℃ and 171-173 day-degrees, when pupae were reared under constant and fluctuating temperature conditions, respectively. Pupae may develop faster in the field by using this mechanism in early spring when the surrounding temperature is low.

N2  - The immature of Reverdin's blue butterfly, Lycaeides argyrognomon (Lycaenidae), exhibits facultative symbiosis with several ant species; Camponotus japonicus, Formica japonica, F. yessensis, Pristomyrmex punctatus, and two other species are its tending ants observed in Yamanashi Pref. In our attempt to clarify key factors regulating the symbiotic association between this myrmecophilous butterfly and ants, we examined the chemical compositions of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of third- and fouth-instar larvae and pupae of the butterfly, together with those of the above ant species. Larvae, irrespective of their instars and attendant ant species, showed a consistent CHC profile, in which n-alkanes, especially C27 and C29, were predominant, with methyl-branched alkanes being minor components. Pupae also possessed almost the same set of CHCs as did larvae. In contrast, the four ant species exhibited distinct and species-specific CHC profiles. The CHCs of C. japonicus and F. japonica consisted mainly of n-alkanes and alkenes of C27 and C29, while those of F. yessensis and P. punctatus contained n-alkanes of C25, C27, C29, and C31. The results strongly suggest that the protection of L. argyrognomon from aggression by ant workers is not due to concealment by chemical camouflage based on CHCs, as is known in some Maculinea butterflies.

N2  - Larval development and diapause of the alien nymphalid butterfly Hestina assimilis assimilis, which was accidentally introduced into Kanagawa Prefecture, central Japan were re-investigated under various temperature conditions at a short and long photoperiod. In particular, influence of low temperature (15℃) linked with long photoperiod (16L-8D) on larval diapause induction was studied. First, when larvae were kept at 15℃, most of the larvae entered a diapause state mainly at the 4th instar irrespective of a long photoperiod while all larvae normally entered a diapause state at a short photoperiod. At 20℃ or 25℃, photoperiodic response was clear and similar to the results in the previous experiments (Kato and Miyauchi, 2008). Second, low temperature treatment under a long photoperiod was carried out at a particular developmental stage. The results showed that low temperature treatment at single larval instar stage had little effect on diapause induction, but the treatment of successive instars (such from 2nd, 3rd or 4th instar) was effective, and the longer the treated duration, the higher the diapause ratio. These results suggest that low temperature alone is responsible for larval diapause induction of this subspecies. Further, some larvae in which diapause had been induced by low temperature associated with a long photoperiod had a long or intermediate type horn, and their body color frequently was green, suggesting that diapause programs of the larvae are easily modified by these temperature conditions. In addition, such irregular diapause-related phenomena are discussed from the point of view of ecological significance, based on information of field observations.

These indices suggested that richer butterfly assemblages remained at Odai site than at Ogi site.

N2  - To clarify the distribution patterns of resource plants suitable for conserving Sasakia charonda, we investigated the densities and sizes of both larval host trees, Celtis sinensis, and trees which serve as an adult food resource, Quercus acutissima, as well as the number of overwintering S. charonda larvae per host tree at an area planted with a mix of C. sinensis and Q. acutissima for preserving S. charonda and in the surrounding area of natural forests. In the afforested area, several of the C. sinensis trees planted in the center withered and died, while none of the Q. acutissima trees died. Dbh (diameter of breast height) of C. sinensis at the edge of the afforested area was significantly larger than that at the interior, and similar to that in the surrounding area of natural forests. In the surrounding natural forests, dbh of C. sinensis at the edge was also significantly larger than that at the interior. The number of overwintering larvae was significantly smaller in the afforested area than in the natural forests. In both the afforested area and the natural forests, the number of overwintering larvae was significantly greater at the edge than in the interior. However, no significant differences were found in the number of overwintering larvae between the edge of the afforested area and in the natural forests. For conservation of S. charonda, it is suggested that Q. acutissima trees should be planted in the interior of a planned afforestation area and C. sinensis should be planted at the edge of the afforestation area.

N2  - Males of the lycaenid butterfly Chrysozephyrus smaragdinus (Bremer) compete for mating territories via non-contact aerial interactions. Field observations revealed that contest duration decreased with increasing time of day. Further analysis showed that air temperature accounted for a significant amount of variability in the contest duration. Air temperature had a negative effect on contest duration, which suggests the influence of heat stress on contest behaviour of the butterfly. However, even when air temperature was taken into account, time of day had a highly significant negative effect on contest duration. A possible underlying mechanism is that males negotiate territorial status at the start of daily territorial activity, resulting in prolonged interactions at this time.

N2  - A nymphalid butterfly Hestina assimilis assimilis, which was recently discovered in Kanagawa prefecture in Japan, undergoes larval diapause and show a seasonal change in wing color pattern: summer and spring (white) morphs. In the present study, temperature and photoperiodic conditions responsible for the control of seasonal morph determination was investigated. First, when post-diapause larvae were reared under various temperatures (15℃, 20℃, 25℃ or 28℃) at a long photoperiod (16L-8D), most of the eclosed adults were of white morph (spring morph). Second, larvae were initially exposed to a short photoperiod (10L-14D), and then transferred to 16L-8D to avoid diapause occurrence. Resulting adults were white morph. Third, individuals were reared at various temperatures (15, 20 or 25℃) under a long photoperiod (16L-8D) through larval and pupal stages. Low temperatures of 15℃ were quite effective for white morph production, but moderate (20℃) or high (25℃) temperatures were not effective, and all butterflies produced developed black veins on the wing (summer morph). Fourth, in experiments where different rearing temperatures were combined during the larval life, a temperature of 15℃ combined with 20℃, but not with 25℃, was effective for producing some intermediate or white morphs. Fifth, the temperature-sensitive stage for white morph production was mostly located in the 3rd and 4th instars (in partiular, 4th instar). In these experiments, white morph production was closely linked with extremely delayed larval development. The results strongly suggest that not only a short photoperiod, but also a relatively cool temperature including 15℃ is quite effective for white morph production even without an intervening larval diapause. Probably, an unknown neuro-endocrine mechanism may be responsible for the seasonal morph regulation as in the case of other butterfly species.

N2  - We discovered adults and eggs of a lycaenid species, Acytolepis puspa, at the University of Tokyo, the Kanto district, which is located far away from the northeastern limit of the species, the west area of the Tokai district. The eggs were found on Quercus phillyraeoides (Fagaceae). This is the first record of the species in the Kanto district. For the purpose of clarifying the dispersal pathway of A. puspa, we initially examined the adult morphology and the genetic variation of this species from Japan (including Tokyo) and the Oriental region. As a result, the wing markings and genetic structure of the species from Tokyo were the same as those from the mainland of Japan, and this subspecies was identified as A.p. ishigakiana. Second, we surveyed all possible hostplants of the species in the university, and found that two Rhododendron plants (Ericaceae) had been recently transplanted from Suzuka City, Mie Pref., which is very close to the known distribution limit for the species. The northern limit of the distribution of A. puspa in Mie Pref. must have reached Suzuka City, due to its spread of the distribution range by recent global warming. Most Probably, immatures of the species have been introduced from Suzuka to Tokyo, with the transplantation of Rhododendron plants.

N2  - We assessed habitat quality of Zizina emelina, a threatened butterfly in Japan, in the farmlands of Kamogawa City, Chiba Prefecture, in central Japan. We established five 50m census routes at three sites, ridges where weeds are mowed only in spring (hereafter, ridges mowed only in spring), ridges where weeds are mowed every month after spring (hereafter, ridges mowed every month) and meadow of Trifolium repens to count the adult Z. emelina along each route. On the ridges mowed only in spring and the ridges mowed every month, there were no significant differences in the number of adult Z. emelina individuals during the period from early April to late June between the two ridges. However, during the period from late June to early September, the number of adults on the ridges mowed only in spring was significantly higher than that on the ridges mowed in every month. During the period from early September to late October, the number of adults tended to increase on the ridges mowed every month, and decrease on those mowed only in spring; as a result, no significant differences were detected in the number of adults between the ridges. In a meadow of Trifolium repens, the adult emergence period was from late August to late October, and the peak in the number of adults was in late September. The synthetic dominance of Lotus japonicus, the larval host plant of Z. emelina, was high at the lower part of both ridges mowed only in spring and those mowed every month, and at both sides of a non-paved footpath present around paddy fields. On the ridges mowed only in spring, the synthetic dominance of L. japonicus declined from May to October, while on the ridges mowed every month, it declined from May to August, and went up from August to September. This suggests that the synthetic dominance of L. japonicus contributed much to the increase in the number of adults during the period from mid August to early October on the ridges mowed in every month. From these results, it is suggested that, in order to retain a high density of Z. emelina and the predominance of L. japonicus in agroecosystems, it is important that a mixture of both ridges that are mowed both in spring and every month is established in their habitats. Since we observed eggs and larvae of Z. emelina on T. repens in the meadow habitat of this study, a meadow habitat is also thought to be important for conservation of Z. emelina.

N2  - We examined the immature stages, larval behaviors, host plant selection, and parasitoids of four Bornean Arhopala butterflies feeding on Macaranga plants which often have species-specific relationships with symbiotic ants. We then compared their biological characteristics to those of butterflies on the Malay Peninsula reported in a previous study. At our study site, the larvae of three Arhopala species were found on Macaranga myrmecophytes. Each Arhopala fed on one or two closely-related Macaranga species: A. amphimuta fed on M. trachyphylla and M. bancana, A. zylda fed on M. beccariana and M. hypoleuca, and A. dajagaka fed on M. hosei. The butterfly-plant relationships and the species-specificity were similar to those observed on the Malay Peninsula. The other Arhopala species, A. major, was observed feeding on non-myrmecophytic M. gigantea and Macaranga sp. A. Among the four Macaranga-feeding Arhopala species, we noted remarkable interspecific variation in larval morphology, behavior, and parasitoid composition. These variations were presumed to be associated with differences in the aggressiveness of ants on host Macaranga plants.

N2  - Butterfly assemblage was monitored using a route census method at 2 observation areas (4 study sites), Matsushiro and Shinsuwa, around the rural zone in Nagano City, Nganago Prefecture from May, 2005 to April, 2006. The numbers of species and individuals found at Matsushiro area were 39 species and 541.00 individuals per 30 minutes, and at Shinsuwa area 32 species and 379.00 individuals. In the rural zone with moderate human disturbance, individual species increased in dominance and grassland species such as Minois dryas bipunctata Motschulsky were able to live in a forest site. The value of ER, ER" and HI-index with environmental values of each species was high in sites without human disturbance such as the forest site of Shinsua, but the value of species diversity indices such as Shannon's H' and Simpson's 1-λ was low. By comparing the human disturbance index (HI-index) and species diversity, it appears that moderate human disturbance created the highest species diversity.

Reproductive ability of F_1-F_3 hybrids was tested by backcross experiment. The ratio of male and female of each F_1-F_3, hybrid was almost equal. Only male adults of F_1, and F_2 had sexual ability. The scent scale of the hybrid showed intermediate features of both parents. The ratio of maximum width of scent sack to maximum width of scent scale was useful for judgment of the interspecific hybrid.

N2  - Larval development and diapause of the alien nymphalid butterfly Hestina assimilis assimilis, which was accidentally introduced into Kanagawa Prefecture, central Japan were investigated under various photoperiodic conditions at 20℃ or 25℃. The larval diapause, which was linked with the formation of a short horn head, was frequently induced at the 4th-instar by a short photoperiod of 12L-12D or less, and averted by a long photoperiod of 14L-10D or more at 20℃. The critical photoperiod was around at 13L-1 ID. At 25℃, although larval diapause was induced by short photoperiods, its ratio was about 50% and some short horn individuals did not enter diapause. This is in contrast with the cases of many temperate native Japanese butterfly species where diapause is completely induced under such conditions, suggesting that this population may have come from warm temperate or nearly subtropical regions located at a rather low latitude. In addition, development during middle larval life was greatly retarded under an intermediate photoperiod such as 13L-11D. This retardation may be important in synchronizing their life cycle with seasonal changes in air temperature and day-length, but it remains unclear whether this functions fully in the climatic conditions of central Japan, which are unfamiliar to this butterfly.

N2  - The genus Tirumala (Nymphalidae, Lepidoptera) is a group belonging to Danainae and consists of 9 species, 2 from Africa and 7 from the Indo-Australian region (Ackery and Vane-Wright, 1984). This is one of the most difficult genera because its member species resemble each other not only in general appearance but also in morphology of the male genitalia. A comparison was made of the microstructure of pheromone transfer particles (PTPs) in the alar pouch for all species in the genus. Here, we report that some definite differences were detected in the microstructure of PTPs between species. The evaluation of PTPs suggests that, in an area where several species fly together, the morphology of PTPs differs from species to species.

N2  - M. A. Fenton, a pioneer lepidopterist in Japan, had been well-known as a respected English teacher in Tokyo, but the motive and time of his trip to Japan has been quite unknown. The articles informing the marriage of M. A. Fenton's sister at Edo on 2nd Aug. 1873 were found in English newspapers published at Yokohama. It was confirmed from other articles that "Mr. Fenton" arrived at Yokohama on 28th July 1873 by a British steamer from Hongkong. The attendance at his sister's wedding was presumably the direct reason for Fenton's visit to Japan. On his arrival in Japan, he found a job to work in Japan as an English teacher of a foreign employee. It might have supported financially his long stay in Japan afterwards. As an amateur naturalist of the Victorian age, his primary motive to visit Japan might have been enhanced by the acute interests over the Japanese insect fauna. He left Japan on 4th Apr. 1880 after his 6-year and 8-month stay in Japan. During that period, his collecting tours were made thrice in the eastern mainland of Japan and twice in Hokkaido, resulting in many new findings of butterfly and moth species. After he went back to England, he worked as H. M. Inspector for decades. Correspondence between Fenton and Riley, N. D. of The British Museum is shown in this paper. In the 1913 letters, Fenton sent lepidopterous specimens from Canada two times, requesting BM to purchase them. His collection of the Japanese butterflies including type specimens were already deposited in the Museum at the time of 1921. As appeared in the letters of 1923, after consultation between them, the specimens were registered by BM in 1923.

N2  - The population of a lycaenid, Shijimiaeoides divinus asonis (Matsumura) has been reduced by environmental changes in some habitats in the Aso area. We conducted route census surveys of this butterfly in 2006 and 2007. The study area is located on the volcanic slopes of Mt Aso in the center of Kyushu, Japan. At the study site, the natural herbaceous grassland, which had been almost completely grazed, was subjected to routine grassland burning every spring. The results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) Pleioblastus chino (Franch. et Savat.) Makino var. viridis (Makino) S. Suzuki was one of the dominant species at the study sites with normal grazing intensity. Zoysia japonica Steud. was one of the dominant species with high grazing intensity. On the other hand, Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. was the dominant species at non-grazing sites. (2) The individual density of the host plant, Sophora flavescens Ait. was significantly different at each study site. (3) The height of the host plant at the non-grazing sites was higher than at other study sites. (4) The number of branches of the host plant at the sites with normal grazing intensity was larger than at other sites. (5) The individual crown area was bigger at the sites with normal grazing. On the other hand, the height and crown area of the host plant at sites with high grazing intensity was smaller than at sites with other grazing intensities. (6) Adult butterflies appear in early May almost disappear by mid June. Individual numbers were affected by low temperatures from April to May, and the density of butterflies markedly decreased in 2007 at all study sites. (7) The number of larvae was significantly different at each study site when population density became high. (8) The number of adults and eggs increased alongside an increase in the number of nectar plants at the grassland where grazing ceased. Based on these results, it is concluded that customary grazing intensity is most suitable for the conservation of this butterfly in the Aso area.

N2  - Butterfly wing color-patterns are highly diverse. Many color-patterns or their elements are ecologically and behaviorally functional in mating, mimicry and camouflage, but it has been thought that not all of them have clearly identifiable functions. How such non-functional, sometimes extravagant color-pattern traits evolved has been enigmatic. To illustrate this process, a model for the color-pattern evolution of the Admiral butterflies (the genus Vanessa sensu stricto) is proposed. It is first assumed that ancestral populations of Vanessa were geographically isolated in high altitude regions where temperatures fluctuate widely. In this model, pupae produce the coldshock hormone (CSH) to protect differentiating cells in response to the temperature fluctuation. This hormone has an opportunistic ability to modify the wing color-patterns as a side effect or pleiotropic effect, revealing phenotypic plasticity of the ancestral populations. The modified phenotypes are rarely adaptive; they are in most cases either not favorable in mating or simply neutral with no adverse or adaptive effects. The modified phenotypes are nonetheless canalized in a population through a process of genetic assimilation accompanying natural selection for high hormonal activity, resulting in diverse orange areas on the wings in the present Vanessa species living in high altitude regions. Thus, the CSH physiologically acts as a mediator of genetic assimilation of the non-functional or neutral traits. In other words, a non-functional or neutral trait can be assimilated in a population as a "parasite" of a functional trait. Following the evolution of mating preferences, premating reproductive isolation might be established, as in the classical mechanism for allopatric speciation. This "physiological side-effect model" may explain the non-functional or neutral wing color-pattern diversity of Vanessa and other butterflies.

N2  - Recently it has been reported that the subtropical argyne butterfly, Argyreus hyperbius (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) has expanded its distribution to the northern areas of Japan. It is easy to suppose that the phenomenon is due to global warming. But, there is a possibility that other factors are involved, and garden plantation of the pansy, Viola wittrockiana, one of the food plants, has been pointed out as one factor by some colleagues. Because of the popularity of gardening in Japan, this plant has been planted in gardens much more extensively than before. This paper discusses the recent northward expansion of A. hyperbius from two viewpoints: one is the fluctuation in the number of butterflies in Hino City, Tokyo, and the other is the increase of pansy boxes transported into Tokyo or Hino City from prefectures inhabited by this butterfly. There is a probability that eggs or young larvae of the butterfly were transported from south to north with the pansy boxes.

N2  - Pupae of the papilionid butterfly, Luehdorfia japonica, secrete a slightly viscous liquid immediately after pupation from the dorsal surface of the head and thorax, mainly from pro- and meso-thoraces. The secretion is colored pale yellowish-brown and emits greenish-blue fluorescence under light irradiation. The fluid, which gradually covers the dorsal surface of almost the whole body within 2 hours of larval-pupal ecdysis, solidifies along with the melanization and sclerotization of the pupal cuticle. The solidified exudate was almost insoluble in water, but was found to absorb a considerable quantity of water, suggesting that the secretion serves as a moisturizer against desiccation. Although the secretion showed no prominent antimicrobial activity, it seemed to have a weak bacteriostatic effect. Possible ecological roles of the secretion are discussed in regard to the survival strategy of the butterfly.

From the 1950s to the 1960s, A. rapae was observed at many sites across Tokyo. From the 1970s, observation records of A. melete increased and A. melete became common even in the urban area of Tokyo during the 1980s. From the 1990s, however, observation records of A. melete decreased and those of A. rapae increased again. These changes of distribution of A. rapae and A. melete were evident not only in the urban area, in 23 wards, but also in rural areas.

N2  - I observed overwintering larvae of the small branded swift, Pelopidas mathias in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture during the winter of 2006-2007. Larval density was highest in a sunny grassland situated by the wall of a building. In this environment, the larval food plant, Imperata cylindrica maintained green leaves throughout the winter, and larvae were active on warm days. Even in February, at an overwintering site that was exposed to the direct rays of the sun, the daily maximum temperature sometimes reached approximately 30℃ whereas the minimum fell to near 0℃. Larvae that were collected in the field in early April and kept in an outdoor cage successfully developed and emerged in mid May-early June as adults. These larvae molted zero to three times before pupation. The pupal period was 22-35 and 16-21 days when the pupation took place in April and May, respectively. Moreover, one adult female was caught by a Malaise trap set in the grassland near the building in mid May. From the results of the present study, larvae of P. mathias seem to be able to pass the winter in inland fields of the northern Kanto region, at least when the winter is mild.

N2  - An unexplained behavior of the butterfly Hypolimnas anomala has been observed occasionally in the subtropical Yaeyama Islands of southern Okinawa, where the female stays with her eggs on the leaf of the food plant after oviposition. On the island of Guam Nafus and Schreiner (1988) reported that some egg masses of this species develop normally without guarding by the female. However, in the absence of such evidence in Japan it has been accepted that without guarding by the female the eggs cannot hatch or the first instar larvae cannot grow if they hatch. We earlier reported on a case where all eggs hatched normally and grew to adult butterflies without female presence in the field. Subsequent studies reported here confirm the finding that the protection of eggs by the female is not always necessary for the hatching of eggs or the growth of newly hatched larvae, leaving the female behavior unexplained.

N2  - A field survey of an endangered lycaenid butterfly, Zizina emelina (de l'Orza) (previously Zizina otis emelina) (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) was conducted in Osaka International Airport on August 4, 2003. A total of 200 adults (166 males and 34 females) of Z. emelina were observed during the survey. Adult densities were high in short grassy areas dominated by Paspalum sp., Digitaria ciliaris, Trifolium pratense, Plantago lanceolata and Coreopsis tinctoria in a baseball field and along a runway. Since the primary foodplant of Z. emelina in Japan, Lotus japonicus, was not found within the airport, it is possible that this species utilizes T. repens and Kummerowia stipulacea as larval foodplants in this area. Considering that most habitats of Z. emelina around OIA have already been lost or degraded, it is the first priority to maintain the population inside the airport to conserve this species in this area.

N2  - Erebia niphonica on the Japanese islands belongs to the aethiops group (sensu Warren, 1936). We conducted molecular phylogenetical analyses of the major subspecies and also of the geographical variations, which are supposed to belong to this group. The result implied that each of E. niphonica from Honshu, and E. "niphonica" scoparia from Sakhalin and Hokkaido has evolved to a species level comparable with E. aethiops, E. alcmena, and E. neriene. We also inferred the phylogeography of the aethiops group. Southern Sakhalin is considered to have been connected to northern Hokkaido during the last glacial period, and many animals and plants were considered to have come over to the Japanese islands through this landbridge. In fact, we detected the identical haplotypes from "niphonica" populations in southern Sakhalin and northern Hokkaido. This supported the hypothesis that genetic exchanges took place. Erebia vidleri in Nearctic region with an external appearance similar to those of the aethiops group, showed a little phylogenetic relationship.

N2  - A female of a myrmecophilous butterfly, Niphanda fusca (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae), was observed in July 2004 to lay eggs on leaf-roll galls induced by Myzus siegesbeckiae (Hemiptera, Aphididae) on lammas shoots of a cherry tree in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Presence of the host ant, Camponotus japonicus (Hymenoptera, Formicidae), was not necessary for the N. fusca female to lay eggs. Many lammas shoots were produced from one of the cherry trees surveyed, due to heavy trimming in June 2004, and every lammas shoot was galled by M. siegesbeckiae colonies. The N. fusca female did not lay eggs on cherry trees with fewer lammas shoots. On the basis of previous and our current observations, we note that N. fusca is one of the late season emergent butterflies that inevitably use lammas shoots as oviposition targets instead of spring shoots. Lammas shoots are unpredictable targets in time, space, and quantity, because they are produced as a compensatory reaction to natural or artificial defoliation. We therefore discuss the importance of management practices in promoting lammas shoot production that may help to prevent the decline of N. fusca populations that has occurred in recent years. We also emphasize the necessity to study interactions between insects that affect the abundance of N. fusca.

N2  - The distribution and seasonal occurrence of the lycaenid butterfly, Zizina emelina (previously Zizina otis emelina), were investigated at 99 sites of grassy sites, including known previous locations around the Osaka International Airport (OIA) on the boundary between Osaka and Hyogo Prefectures, central in Japan between 2000 and 2007. In addition, eggs obtained from 31 field-collected females were reared into adults under quasi-natural conditions in different seasons to infer the developmental period in the field. Zizina emelina were seen at 43 of the 99 survey sites. Of the 43 sites, 15 and 21 were on or near embankments of the Inagawa River and in the grass of the urbanized region around the OIA, respectively. In contrast, this species was recorded from only seven survey sites in the Send Hills, located to the northeast of the OIA. The density of adults was especially high at 12 sites in the vicinity of the OIA and at one in the Senri Hills. The population living around the OIA depends on white clover, Trifolium repens (Fabaceae), and/or Japanese clover, Kummerovia striata (Fabaceae), as larval food plants rather than the bird's-foot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae), the major food plant of Z. emelina in Japan, which was not found in the area around the OIA. In contrast, in the Senri Hills, Z. emelina and L. corniculatus were observed to cooccur at two sites, where the eggs of the butterfly were found on the plant. From the results of field observations and rearing experiments, we inferred Z. emelina has 6-7 generations in the field around the OIA, with the adult flight season being between April and November. Intriguingly, some field-collected females produced no male offspring (i. e. all F_1 adults were female).

N2  - A phylogenetic analysis using final-instar caterpillars of 14 species of Saturniidae was conducted. A total of 22 scoli from 2 thoracic and 4 abdominal segments was categorized according to shape (flat, raised, bulbous) and structure (hairs and spines). Most of the branchings and pairings in the resulting cladogram were supported by previously published classifications. Results support synonymizing Eriogyna under Saturnia (sensu stricto), indicate a close relationship between Eudia and Calosaturnia, and another clade groups Perisomena, Neoris, and Agapema. The genus Caligula as it is currently defined is considered to be polyphyletic.

N2  - There have been some previous studies about when and through which route the alpine organisms ranging in the Japanese islands migrated from the continent, and how their distribution range has changed within the islands while adapting to the climate changes in the Quaternary. There are studies about alpine plants based on recent molecular information. A scenario has been proposed that there are two lineages. One is the lineage that had relict distribution during interglacials. The other is the lineage that migrated into the Japanese islands during later glacial periods. On the other hand, animals have mobility and are able to move around following environmental changes such as climate changes. Therefore, there is a possibility of having a different scenario from that of plants. We chose Erebia niphonica, and studied the distribution change of alpine organisms in the Japanese islands during the Quaternary. We studied the haplotypes of base sequences of 942 bp in total using ND5 and COI. Samples are 427 individuals from the Japanese islands, Mongolia and Russia. We inferred past historical events by analyzing the haplotypes using the Nested Clade Phylogeographical Analysis (NCPA). As a result it has been suggested that the Erebia niphonica group went through isolation in more than one refugium in Hokkaido and more than one in Honshu during warm interglacials, and that they fragmented into different lineages within the Japanese islands. Also we specified the secondary contact points which support the NCPA which inferred that range fragmentation and dispersal were repeated.

Three sites were environmentally different in their land use. Cessation of the farming field and subsequent vegetation succession influenced the butterfly assemblage, and the composition of species decreased. It is suggested that artificial management of environment is necessary for maintaining biodiversity of butterflies in Yato.

N2  - Six letters sent from M. A. Fenton to C. Ishikawa in the 1880s are preserved in the University Museum of Tokyo, and now shown for the first time. As Ishikawa later became a Professor of Zoology in the University of Tokyo, the letters contain many biological and entomological topics of historical interest. These letters reveal new facts about the early period of modern Japanese lepidopterology. A letter written in the summer of 1884 demonstrates a hitherto unknown contribution of Fenton to the identification of a Luehdorfia butterfly, which was newly discovered in the mainland of Japan by Y. Nawa in April, 1883. A tentative 127 species catalogue of Japanese butterflies compiled at that time is restored from the letter and related references. Serial numbers from the list were used in the letter to designate the butterfly species, for the convenience of mutual communication.

N2  - New categories of hilltopping/hilltopper supplementing the traditional one in the sense of Shields (1967) can be defined by examining the proportions of each behavioral category practiced by hilltopping males of 15 butterfly species on the summit, subsummit and slope of Mt Nijo and Mt Katsuragi, Central Japan from April to October in 2002. Proportions were evaluated based on percentage of male behavioral patterns, Perching, Flying, Intra- and Inter-specific fights, Foraging, etc., observed in a total of 22 and 26 5-m radius observation circles scattered on each altitudinal subzone of Mts Katsuragi and Nijo, respectively, during 5 min census periods. Five different types of hilltopping behavior, Types A1, A2, B, C1 and C2, were separated in this study. Species from Type Al, the narrow sense or "classical" hilltopping type, used hilltops only for mating. Papilio machaon, Luehdorfia japonica, Argyreus hyperbius, Cynthia cardui, Vanessa indica, the overwintering adult of Nymphalis xanthomelas, Hestina japonica and Lampides boeticus belonged to Type A1. Type A2 species such as Papilio xuthus, Papilio bianor and Papilio helenus were identical in purpose to Type A1 but never perched and had a patrolling route running through the slopes. Type B species, such as Parnara guttata, used hilltops for a combination of 3 purposes: nectaring, mating and as a short stop during their migrations. In Type C1 species, such as Libythea celtis and the summer adult of N. xanthomelas, hilltops were used as temporary habitats during aestivation, including reproductive diapause for L. celtis, to avoid summer heat in lowland areas. Finally, in Type C2 species, such as Colias erate and Lycaena phlaeas, hilltops were not only used as temporary habitats during aestivation but other purposes were also associated: breeding on food-plant in the case of C. erate, nectaring and mating.

N2  - As a part of the process of conserving the Satoyama ecosystem (mountain village ecosystem), the population of Luehdorfia japonica (Leech) inhabiting Kaisho-no-Mori Forest and Aichi Youth Park has been monitored from 2001 to 2005. Kaisho-no-Mori Forest is located near the site of the 2005 World Exposition, Aichi, Japan (EXPO2005) and Aichi Youth Park was used as a part for the site for EXPO2005. Monitoring consisted of investigation of the numbers of eggs, larvae and adults. Eggs and larvae on the host plant, Asarum kooyanum Makino var. bachypodion (F. Maek.) Kitam., were directly counted, and the number of adults was estimated both by observation and the mark-release-recapture method (MRR method). The monitoring results from 2001 to 2004 made by the Japan Association for the 2005 World Exposition (JAEXPO2005) were compared with our results. According to the latter report, the number of Luehdorfia japonica decreased in year only, 2000, and gradually increased towards 2004 in Kaisho-no-Mori Forest. The monitoring result presented by JAEXPO2005 also showed the gradual increase of this butterfly in Aichi Youth Park.

N2  - Although sesiids have been considered one of the major seed predators of dipterocarp trees in Southeast Asia, little has been documented regarding their mode of predation. We investigated the mode of seed predation by Synanthedon nautica. (Meyrick, 1932) (Sesiidae) on Neo-balanocarpus heimii (Dipterocarpaceae), a tree species that produces high-quality timber, at Pasoh Forest Reserve in Negeri Sembilan, Peninsular Malaysia. In total, ten individuals of S. nautica emerged from 283 seeds of various sizes. All S. nautica were found in mature seeds that had the ability to germinate (seeds&ge;3.0 g), suggesting that S. nautica feeds on mature seeds. The length of time for 5. nautica to emerge from the seed varied from 13 to 42 days (31.3 days on average). Time to adult eclosion was not dependent on seed weight. The biological adaptation of S. nautica to mast fruiting of dipterocarps in Southeast Asia is discussed.

N2  - Pheromone transfer particles (PTPs) found in the male alar pouch of the genus Tirumala serve to make females recognize their mates and there is a possibility that the chemical composition of the pheromone is species specific. In order to evaluate this possibility, the microstructure of PTPs for seven species of Tirumala was compared using a scanning electron microscope. PTPs of T. gautama, choaspes, ishmoides, septentrionis and hamata are, though slightly different in shape, almost rounded. On the other hand, those of T. limniace and T. petiverana are characteristically polyhydric in shape and a little smaller in size. There is a possibility that the characteristic microstructure of PTPs in individual Tirumala species reflects the clear sexual isolation.

Five moths were collected and identified as males of C. cilia (Staudinger, 1888). In night collecting at the same place, six Chasminodes species, including C. cilia, were trapped. The day-time flight of male C. cilia is considered to be mating behaviour by males in search of females.

N2  - Most saturniid moths are generalists, and various species of foodplants used by them have been recorded. In Japan, all saturniid moths are large in size, and most larvae feed on the leaves of oak trees (Fagaceae), elm trees (Ulmaceae) and birch trees (Betulaceae), which are forested for the traditional "Satoyama" coppice in Japan. It is essential to have an understanding of the roles of Saturniidae in energy flow and the food web in a coppice. However, studies on the biology and community ecology of these moths are limited. We report the foodplants used by these moths in the field, and discuss the relationship between the range of saturniid larvae foodplants (including foodplant species in the literature in Japan) and the genealogy of saturniid moths in Japan. We discovered 44 foodplant species from 19 families utilized by eight species of saturniid moth (Samia cynthia, Antheraea yamamai, Saturnia jonasii, S. japonica, Rhodinia fugax, Actias gnoma, A. artemis, and Aglica japonica) in our studies. We discovered the larvae of A. yamamai, S. jonasii, S. japonica, R. fugax and A. japonica feeding on a new foodplant, C. tschonoskii (Betulaceae), at most study sites. R. fugax utilized the new foodplants Quercus phillyraeoides (Fagaceae), Salix chaenomeloides, S. subfragilis (Salicaceae) and Benthamidia florida (Cornaceae), and S. jonasii utilized the new foodplants Q. phillyraeoides (Fagaceae), Lindera umbellata var. membranacea (Lauraceae), Ilex rotunda (Aquifoliaceae), Swida macrophylla (Cornaceae), Lyonia ovalifolia (Ericaceae) and Styrax japonica (Styracaceae). In similarity tests using the Ochiai index (OI) for the foodplant species of saturniid moths, the foodplant species of S. jonasii most closely resembled those of S. japonica (OI=0.417). The foodplant species of A. yamamai do not closely resemble those of other species of Saturniidae (OI&le;0.377). Saturniid moths may avoid overlapping of foodplants. In Euclidean distance analysis, it was shown that S. japonica is the remotest species. The geographic distribution of S. japonica is wide, so we suggest that the foodplants of S. japonica have changed, with the insects adjusting to various species of vegetation that occur over its range. As regards the foodplant habits of saturniid moths, it appears that the foodplant preferences of Saturniidae have become diversified according to local habitat vegetation and to allow them to compete for foodplant resources with other Lepidoptera larvae. S. japonica, which lays an egg mass, may shift its preferred foodplant to other surrounding plants in the case of diet shortage caused by overcrowding of larvae. It is suggested that the number of foodplant species increased by oviposition on extra-foodplants and/or by escaping to other plants.

N2  - Celastrina sugitanii in the San-in District of Japan is a specialist depending on flowers of Aesculus turbinata. A field survey carried out in Misasa, Tottori Prefecture during 2003-2005 indicated that they laid eggs in late April. In late May the mature larvae left the host tree and fell to the ground surface, as was demonstrated by more than a hundred larvae collected with litter-fall traps under the host tree. The period for egg and larval stages in the field was thus estimated to be ca 36 days. Rearing tests under different temperature conditions (18, 21, 24, 27℃; all 16L8D) in the laboratory revealed an extraordinary developmental zero point of the larvae, -0.9℃, despite of a normal value of 7.8℃ for the congeneric C. argiolus. The extreme value, caused by rapid larval growth at lower temperatures, should imply a climatic adaptation developed in C. sugitanii which needs to accomplish almost all its food assimilation within a restricted flowering period of Aesculus turbinata in May.

Female adults of the two exotic populations laid eggs on A. nipponicum, and most of the larvae developed into normal sized pupae on A. nipponicum. The results suggest that both exotic populations can establish new populations and compete for the larval food plant with the native population on Mt Ishizare-yama.

N2  - An unusual threat-action in a Japanese moth Smerinthus planus belonging to the family Sphingidae is reported. This species has an eyespot pattern on the hindwing. When the moth was surprised, it opened its four wings to show its eyespot pattern, and displayed a "shrink and stretch" threat-action. The action apparently increased the effect of the threat against an enemy. Another Japanese species of the same genus, Smerinthus tokyonis, also with an eyespot pattern on its hindwing, when stimulated opened its four wings to threaten the enemy. However, in this species the "shrink and stretch" motion was not observed. As far as I know, no one has reported this curious threat-action in S. planus, although this is a very common species in Japan.

N2  - Assemblage structures of butterflies were studied by the transect count method in Farm and Coppice landscapes in a Satoyama, the traditional rural landscape of Japan, around Mt Mikusa in northern Osaka, central Japan from April to October, 2004. Transects in Farm and Coppice landscapes were classified into three and six landscape components, respectively, according to vegetation and landscape. To analyze characteristics of butterfly assemblage structures in the Satoyama, the serai rank of each butterfly was determined based on serai stages in which the main larval food plants occur, and compositions of each serai rank species were compared among landscapes and landscape components. A total of 1322 individuals belonging to 56 species from seven families were recorded throughout the whole study area. Both species richness and density of butterflies were higher in Coppice landscape (46 and 20.4 respectively) than in Farm landscape (39 and 13.1 respectively), while species diversity (1-λ) and evenness (J') were higher in Farm landscape (0.91 and 0.75 respectively) than in Coppice landscape (0.85 and 0.66 respectively). Coppice landscape and the whole study area were characterized by the dominance of three dwarf bamboo feeders, Lethe diana, L. sicelis and Neope goschkevitschii. In addition, both species richness and densities of univoltine butterflies including grass, violet and deciduous oak tree feeders were abundant in Coppice landscape. Analysis based on the SR index revealed that species richness and densities of butterflies dependent on plants occuring in young forests and deciduous broad-leaved forests as larval foods were high in Coppice landscape, whereas those dependent on plants occuring in short to tall grasslands were high in Farm landscape. On the other hand, some species of intermediate rank showed a wide range of distribution in Farm and Coppice landscapes in the study area. The results demonstrate that butterflies dependent on plants in wide ranges of serai stages of vegetation inhabit Satoyama. The mosaic structure of vegetation in terms of the serai stage is important for conservation of species diversities of butterflies in Satoyama.

N2  - In southern mainland Japan-Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu-the Powdered Oakblue (Narathura bazalus) lycaenid butterflies overwinter as adults in aggregations. Some occasionally appear in autumn as stray visitors on many of the Nansei Islands including those where no food-plants grow. This article reports the first confirmed mass migration-like flight of the species observed on Gaja-Jima (29°54'N, 129°32'E), an islet in the Nansei Islands. The flight was observed around sunset on 3 October 1994, day 27.4 in the moon phase. The observation indicates that the butterflies continued to fly above the sea in darkness illuminated only by starlight.

N2  - Almost all of pupae of Celastrina sugitanii entered long diapause for ten months, after short larval stage for ca 25 days. Seasonal changes in carbohydrate contents of the pre-diapausing and diapausing pupae were pursued using mainly gas chromatography. Of 6.64 nig/pupa carbohydrates accumulated in their larval period, ca 70% was consumed within pre-diapause phase, two weeks after pupation, at a rate of 0.32 mg/pupa/day, when adult morphogenesis progressed in the pupa. Consumption rate of carbohydrates was then strongly suppressed down to 0.004 mg/pupa/day in diapause phase, despite of higher ambient temperature of 24℃. Trehalose began to accumulate during the pre-diapausing morphogenesis period, increased up to 1.35% of body weight until June 20. Both glucose and inositol contents decreased concomitantly with the trehalose production. The trehalose content was stable throughout diapause phase irrespective of exposure to chilling stimuli at 5℃. Although two Celastrina species, C. sugitanii and C. argiolus, can be regarded as trehalose accumulating type in terms of cryobiology, their supercoolig points were different from each other: The pupae of C. sugitanii supercooled down to -15℃ probably without freezing tolerant ability, while the pupae of C. argiolus supercooled down to -22.4℃.

N2  - In order to discriminate hilltopping butterflies and elucidate their phenology, we fixed, respectively, 46 and 26 5-m radius virtual circles on the summit, subsummit and slope of Mt Katsuragi (960 m alt.) and Mt Nijo (2 peaks: Medake, 474 m alt. and Odake, 517 m alt.) located on the boundary between Osaka and Nara Prefectures, central Japan. During annual surveys from spring to autumn in 2001-2002 on Mt Katsuragi and in 2002 on Mt Nijo, we used the mean frequency of visits during 5 min census periods in each observation circle as quantification method. A total of 55 species (8 families) were observed and 29 species were common to the 3 peaks, with 53 species seen in Mt Katsuragi, 42 in Medake and 31 in Odake. On both mountains, most species were rare (low abundance). According to 2001 results from Mt Katsuragi, Papilio machaon, Argyreus hyperbius, Libythea celtis, Colias erate and Lycaena phlaeas were classified as hilltoppers because their distributions were statistically biased on the "broad summit" (including summit and subsummit circles). However, the hilltopper status of the last three species remains controversial. On Mt Nijo 2002, Vanessa indica, Cynthia cardui, P. machaon, Papilio xuthus, Papilio bianor, Papilio helenus, Nymphalis xanthomelas, A. hyperbius, Lampides boeticus and Hestina japonica were hilltopping. Although all those species were also recorded on Mt Katsuragi, data from 2001 and 2002 confirm that, on Mt Katsuragi, P. xuthus, P. bianor, P. helenus and H. japonica were not hilltopping. All other Nijo's hilltoppers were also hilltopping in Mt Katsuragi (2001 and/or 2002 data). On the contrary, Parnara guttata and Luehdorfia japonica were hilltopping on Mt Katsuragi in 2002 but not on Mt Nijo, where L. japonica was not recorded. C. erate, L. phlaeas and L. celtis were not hilltoppers on Mt Nijo. P. xuthus, H. japonica and C. cardui were hilltopping on Medake but not on Odake. Though some hilltopping species were very abundant on the summit in the 3 seasons (P. machaon), or only 2 seasons (summer and autumn for A. hyperbius, spring and summer for C. erate and L. celtis) or 1 season (autumn for L. boeticus and P. guttata), variation existed between peaks concerning the dominance ranking order of those species. On the other hand, some hilltoppers such as V. indica, were rare or relatively rare on the 3 peaks in the 3 seasons, though still presenting some variability in relative abundance and dominance ranking status between peaks.

N2  - In 2003, we marked 44 individuals of Luehdorfia japonica at the five peaks (Peaks A-Peak E) of Mt Egesan, and tried to recapture them at the peaks. We detected 25 occurrences of peak-to-peak translocations by 13 individuals, and 15 translocations among the 25 were manifested on the same day. Direct peak-to-peak distances were, Peak A-Peak E, 460 m; Peak D-Peak E, 420 m; Peak A-Peak D, 340 m; and Peak A-Peak B, 125 m. In 2004, we marked 27 individuals, and eleven translocations on 5 individuals were detected. Eight translocations among the eleven occurrences were detected on the same day. In 2005, we marked 52 individuals, and 17 translocations on nine individuals were detected. Five translocations among the 17 occurrences were detected on the same day. As is also explained in another manuscript (Watanabe and Hirano, 2006), the male flight behaviors of Luehdorfia japonica at the summit area are categorized into at least three types; round-patrolling with rests at specific points, perching occupation with repeated circular flights, and peak-to-peak translocation. Implications of the flight behaviors are discussed in regards to the mating activities of males coupled with the avoidance of population divergence.

N2  - The adult female of the tussock moth, Orgyia recens, has vestigial wings. However, there was no difference in wing development between sexes until pupation. Even in the beginning of the pupal stage, females retained well-developed wing discs as large as those of males. Then the histological change of female pupal wing epithelia of this species was observed using light microscopy. As a result, wing degeneration was observed in the female wing epithelium just after the adult differentiation began. Phagocytosis was also observed during the wing degeneration in the central large area of pupal wing epithelia. These results strongly suggest that the wing degeneration of O. recens was caused by programmed cell death.

N2  - Experimental treatment of pupae with cold shock or tungstate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, produces a series of unique wing color-pattern modifications in adult butterflies. Being similar to the tungstate-induced modifications, several Vanessa species can be arranged in a series of the systematic color-pattern differences largely based on the relative area of orange (RAO) on the forewings. The hypothetical molecular pathway that is sensitive to cold shock or tungstate has been proposed to be involved in speciation of these butterflies. Here we investigated phylogeny of Vanessa and its related butterflies in reference to DNA sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene and cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene. Seven species that belong to the conventional Vanessa genus were separated into two groups: Five species, V. indica, V. samani, V. dejeanii, V. dilecta, and V. buana, formed an independent cluster with strong bootstrap support ("the indica group"), excluding V. atalanta and V. tameamea as a separate clade ("the atalanta group"). Thus, the indica group contains five species with various RAO values including V. samani (which has large RAO value) and V. dejeanii (which has small RAO value). Similarly, the atalanta group consists of two species, V. atalanta and V. tameamea, whose RAO values are quite different from each other. Our data argue for the evolutionary model in which the conventional Vanessa genus, but not its related genera, has a unique tendency to evolve "bi-directionally" to species with large or small orange area on the forewings beyond phylogenetic constraint from either the indica or atalanta groups within the genus.

N2  - Atrophaneura nox (Swainson, 1823) was described from Java, Indonesia, and is known to be widely distributed from the Malay Peninsula to Borneo, Sumatra, Java and their associated islands. Because of the wide geographical variations of wing pattern, this species has so far been divided into eleven subspecies. In this paper, we revise the taxonomical status of all the described subspecies and classified this species into fourteen subspecies including two new ones from the Banyak Islands and Singkep Island. After close re-examination, Atrophaneura tungensis Zin et Leow, 1982 from C. Sumatra turns out to be a subspecies of A. nox.

N2  - We conducted transect counts of butterflies in 1999 and 2001 in a coppice on Mt Mikusa, northern Osaka Prefecture, central Japan, to elucidate the effects of experimental mowing on species diversity and assemblage structure of butterflies. At the study site, the forest floor, which had been almost covered with dwarf bamboo in 1999, was mown after the autumn of 2000 to produce alternating 25-m intervals of mown and unmown strips of undergrowth on an experimental basis. Totals of 975 and 775 individuals belonging to 41 and 46 butterfly species were observed respectively before (1999) and after (2001) completion of the strip mowing. Three species of multivoltine satyrids, Lethe diana, L. sicelis and Neope goschkevitschii, dependent on tree sap and dwarf bamboo for their adult and larval food resources, respectively, were dominant in both survey years, although their densities were greatly decreased in 2001. In contrast, annual counts of nectar-dependent and forest herb feeding butterflies, including two species of univoltine fritillaries, Argynnis paphia and Damora sagana, increased in 2001. Thus the stripe mowing of undergrowth enhanced the species diversity of butterflies in the study site coppice by suppressing densities of dominant dwarf bamboo feeders and benefiting forest herb feeders.

N2  - Male germ-line chromosomes were examined in fourteen species of the Hesperiidae. Chromosome number was observed from n, 9 to n, 31 according to species. In Lepidoptera, modal number is n, 31, and the chromosome number seems to have evolved towards decrease mainly through fusion. Based on the chromosome number, this family is divided into six groups, viz. n, 31, 30; n, 29, 28; n, 24; n, 16, 15; n, 10, 9; n, 50, among which the n, 10, 9 group is newly found in this study. This grouping is nearly coincident with the modern higher classification of this family.

N2  - The photoperiodic induction of diapause in a newly established population of Pieris brassicae (L.) in Hokkaido, Japan was investigated. The critical photoperiod for pupal diapause was about 13hr50min at 20℃. In the fields of Sapporo City in Hokkaido, diapausing pupae were obtained late in September. The present results obtained in the laboratory correlated well with the photoperiodic conditions of the diapause incidence observed in the field late in September. A well synchronized emergence from diapausing pupae was induced by chilling at 5℃ or 10℃ for 160 days. The conditions were comparable to the period of cold season in the habitat of this population.

N2  - We marked 29 individuals (27♂ 2♀) of Luehdorfia japonica (Leech) in 2002 at the summit of Mt Egesan, and analysed their subsequent flight behaviors. The life span at the peak was estimated as 15-17 days. We describe the diurnal changes of the flight tracks and discuss their implications for mating and population convergence. The flight pattern develops in time. After making a short random "wandering flight" in the morning, a flyway of "round-patrolling" with a few preferential staying spots develops. On certain occasions, they manifest a "perching occupation" at a specific staying spot. During the round-patrolling, "spiraling flight" is evoked when encountering another male individual of the same species. And, if the encounter is a virgin female, they copulate. The flight activities of each individual at the peak seem to be individually specific, and generally cover a wider area with aging. During the survey, evidence of peak-to-peak round trips (at least 680 m flight within four hours) was obtained. These behaviors of male individuals produce a wide-spread coverage of the peak area by a scattered distribution of female-seeking males. This undoubtedly is an effective strategy for lowering the probability of females remaining virgin in the meta-population.

The distribution, habitat, behavior, life history, larval host plant, migration, dispersal, adult diet, predators, parasitoids, and microbiological data for each species are presented. Libytheana carinenta is wide-spread, with a distribution ranging from southern Canada to Argentina. It has multiple annual generations and can be found in various habitats, including deserts, grasslands, and forests. Libytheana carinenta regularly lands on the ground, frequently visits flowers, disperses in very large numbers, and has territorial males. Nothing is known about the immature stages of the three insular species.

Descriptions and illustrations are provided for the larval and pupal morphology as well as for the adult one. On the basis of several character states, the new species apparently belongs to the clade named by Kaila (2004) "the core Batrachedra". Several immature character states that may be additional apomorphies supporting the core Batrachedra are mentioned. Larvae of the new species are frequently detected in inspections of Smilax china imported from China at the Plant Protection Station. Some male and female specimens, which are quite similar to the new species in the genitalia but distinctly larger than the type specimens, were collected at several localities in Japan. These Japanese specimens are left untreated until their immature stages are discovered.

N2  - Achillides is a subgenus of the genus Papilio commonly called swallowtail butterflies, which inhabits East Asia including Japan. Achillides consists of many similar species, of which subspecies are distributed in many East Asian islands. Here, we analyzed phylogenetic relationships among these species and their subspecies with nucleotide sequences of the mitochodrial ND5 gene. The analysis revealed that Papilio polyctor and P. bianor bianor are an identical species, and P. syfanius and P. maackii are also an identical species due to the identity of their nucleotide sequences. These butterflies have been considered taxonomically different species based on their distinct wing patterns. The analysis also revealed that Achillides are separated into two clades, which, however, do not agree with the grouping based on wing pattern similarity. One clade is composed of P. bianor, P. polyctor, P. hermeli, and P. dialis, while the other clade is composed of P. maackii, P. syfanius, P. krishna, P. hopponis, P. arcturus, P. karna and P. pans. Several pairs of species having a similar wing pattern are present in both clades. These findings may be evidence of parallel evolution, indicating that morphological convergence occurred between the species belonging to different clades after their ancestors had diverged. Speciation due to the wing pattern changes may have occurred in a relatively short period during the evolution of Achillides. Finally, we also discuss the revision of classification of the P. bianor subspecies and P. fuscus based on DNA sequence analysis.

The adult of each species typically lands at damp spots on the ground, and visits flowers in low elevation mountains. Novel data from my field observations are also included. The male typically is territorial, and both sexes cryptically rest on branches. Most species are found in forests and disturbed habitats, and usually have one or two annual generations. The egg is generally laid on buds of Celtis (Celtidaceae), and in nearly all cases, the larva feeds on leaves of this plant genus. Little is known about the developmental stages of Libythea cinyras Trimen, L. collenettei Poulton & Riley, and L. narina Godart.

The rate of females with a mature ovary at 20℃ under 12L-12D, 13L-11D,14L-10D and 15L-9D were 7.7, 56.0, 30.0, and 65.4%, respectively, and those at 25℃ under 12L-12D, 13L-11D, 14L-10D and 15L-9D were 40.0, 58.8, 72.0, and 78.0%, respectively. It is considered that temperature and photoperiod have an effect on ovarian development of this species, and that the lower the temperature and the shorter the photoperiods, the lower the rate of females with a mature ovary. However, since the photoperiodic reaction was continuous, it is shown that there were females with a mature ovary and with an immature ovary under any conditions from summer to autumn.

N2  - Elachista nipponicella sp. nov. belonging to the E. freyerella-group is described on the basis of dozens of specimens collected at various localities in Japan. From other species of the same species-group known in the Far East, the new species can be separated by the characters of the phallus in the male and the shape of the ostium in the female. Some characters of the female genitalia show rather large individual variation, though such variation is continuous and considered to be individual variation within a single species. Biological notes are given for the new species.

P. venilia proved to have remarkable peculiarities in the morphology of adults in addition to the morphological and food plant differences of immature stages reported by Igarashi & Fukuda (1997). Based on these, it is concluded that this species should be classified not into the genus Pantoporia but into Acca Hubner, 1819, a genus independent from Pantoporia.

N2  - The geographical and seasonal variations of Eurema hecabe hecabe are studied for 60 collecting sites in the Indo-China area. Three color pattern types in pubescences on forewing anterior margin are recognized. The brown to dark brown type is widely distributed in the study area, the yellow to yellowish type is restricted to the northern area, and the blackish brown type is recorded from Di Linh, southern Vietnam only. In upperside black distal borders on the forewings, B0 to A3 types are recorded in all the areas and in both dry and wet seasons, and B0 type is most abundant. The degree of variation is smaller in the southern areas than in the northern areas. In Di Linh of southern Vietnam, large-sized specimens are found and they also have a different shape of uncus in the male genitalia and blackish brown pubescences on the anterior margin of forewings, suggesting that they may represent an independent species.

N2  - We observed the cocoons of Furcula furcula (Clerck) (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae), which were predated at an urban park in Osaka Prefecture in central Japan. The predated cocoons included two types that bore pupal fragments or none inside, possibly indicating different predation modes by birds. Most of the cocoons were attacked, with the predation rates being 97.4% (N=117) on January 10, 2002, and 88.4% (N=69) on April 1, 2004, although the cocoon distribution pattern varied between the examination dates. The host trees were regularly planted along an avenue, and the twigs on their trunks were cleared every winter. Therefore, the predators could efficiently forage for F.furcula cocoons.

N2  - Brown and yellow types in the forewing fringe color in the so-called "Eurema hecabe (L.)" show sympatric distribution on Okinawajima Island in the Ryukyu Islands and occurrence of their characters is closely linked with seasonal wing morph expression and host plant use (Kato, 2000a, b). Further, these sympatric types are sexually isolated at the level of behavior (Kobayashi et al., 2001). In the present study, distribution pattern of these two types was investigated in southwestern Japan (16 sites) and Taiwan (3 sites) and their taxonomic status was reevaluated. In Amami-Oshima, Kuroshima, Kumejima, Taketomijima, Iriomotejima and Yonagunijima Islands, only the brown type was found while in Kagoshima-shi, and Okinoerabujima, Yoronjima and Tokashikijima Islands, only the yellow type was seen. Sympatric distribution of the two types was found in Tokunoshima, Okinawajima, Miyakojima, Ishigakijima and Haterumajima Islands, and Taiwan. The fringe color type was linked with seasonal wing morph expression and host plant use in all populations, as shown in previous papers (Kato, 2000a, b). These results strongly suggest that the two types have differentiated at the species level. The examination of the lectotype of Papilio hecabe Linnaeus, 1758 revealed that it was the brown type. Based on these, we here propose that the yellow type butterflies belong to a different species, Eurema sp.

N2  - Two butterfly species, Sasakia charonda and Hestina japonica, have similar life cycles, which both use the same woody species as host plant and overwinter at the base of host trees during larval stages. We investigated the relationship between the density of overwintering larvae of these two butterfly species and habitat characteristics at two sites, i. e., a suburban site, where secondary deciduous broadleaf forest is distributed widely and continuously, and an urban area, which had a smaller, patchier distribution of forest than the former site. Density of S. charonda larvae was significantly higher in the suburban site than in the urban area, while the difference in the densities of H. japonica larvae between the two sites was not significant. The result of a two way ANOVA, in which study site and butterfly species were set up as two independent variables, suggested that S. charonda might be sensitive to decrease in secondary deciduous broadleaf forest as a result of urbanization, whereas H. japonica is superior to S. charonda in adaptability to reductions in the forest and might have a different life history strategy from S. charonda. There was a significant positive correlation between the density of S. charonda larvae and the total area of all forest types or the total area of the secondary deciduous broadleaf forests, but no significant correlations were detected for H. japonica between them. The fact that the density of overwintering larvae of S. charonda was affected by reductions in secondary deciduous broadleaf forest, may be closely connected to (1) that the density of eggs laid by female adults decreased when the area of nearby secondary deciduous broadleaf forest decreased and/or (2) that the mortality rates of young- and intermediate- instar larvae increased when the area of forest decreased. On the other hand, the fact that a significant correlation was not found between the density of overwintering H. japonica larvae and the area of secondary deciduous broadleaf forest around the host trees may be closely related to (1) that the female adults of H. japonica lay eggs on host trees quite independently of the area of the secondary deciduous broadleaf forest surrounding the host trees, and/or (2) that the mortality rates and factors of this species are different from those of S. charonda larvae, and are not affected by the area of the forest surrounding host trees. The result of this study provided helpful clues for clarifying the reason why S. charonda and H. japonica coexist to some extent geographically, but their local distribution patterns differ from each other in Japan.

Based on the addresses and families which appear in the letters, documents concerning his birth, marriage and death were obtained and the outline of his life has become almost clear. He was born in Doncaster, England in 1850, stayed in Japan as an English teacher from 1874 to 1880. Returning to England, he graduated from St. John's College, Cambridge and followed a career as an H. M. Inspector of Technichal Colleges & Schools. He married Harriette Eleanor Binny in 1889 and had a daughter, Sylvia Ermyntrude in 1893. In 1924 or so, Fenton and his wife went to California, USA, where their married daughter lived, via Canada. He closed his days in California in 1937.

Dasysphecia ursina Kallies & Arita, sp.n. cannot be confused with any other Sesiidae. It is unique by its large size and its uniformly brown and hairy body. The genus Dasysphecia is transferred from the tribe Sesiini to Cissuvorini and its systematic position is discussed.

N2  - In the present paper, I describe 27 beak-marked specimens from 15 species of Japanese noctuid moths and two satyrine butterflies. The most characteristic beak-damage pattern in Noctuidae is two tears on the same side of fore- and hindwings. They correspond to an overlapping position of the closed wings while the moth is resting. The attack by a bird might occur only once. Some moths had beak-mark only on their hindwings. These cases are thought to be due to moths opening their wings before flying to threaten an enemy. Apparently birds were attracted by their hindwing pattern to attack. It was estimated that about 20 to 40% of moths coming to light traps had experience of escape from the attacks by birds. The symmetrical beak-damage patterns on both forewings or on both hindwings are characteristic in the butterflies studied, and never seen in moths. The butterfly is attacked while resting with its wings closed.

N2  - Foraging behavior of aggregating larvae in the pierid butterfly Eurema blanda was examined in laboratory conditions. Aggregates consisting of 13 to 17 larvae were successively observed from newly hatching to early 5th instar on the potted food plants. The aggregating larvae moved away from the site where all or most of food leaves were consumed, and then re-aggregated to a new site nearby one or two days later. During migration, the larvae moved individually. Although some larvae temporarily lost their way, they finally arrived at a new feeding site. Further, some larvae frequently used the same route during foraging, suggesting that some signals such as silk thread and/or pheromone deposited by the preceding larvae are used.

N2  - M.A. Fenton was an Englishman and a pioneer of lepidopterological survey of Japan in the early Meiji era. His findings including the descriptions of many new species greatly contributed to the elucidation of the Japanese fauna. However, his profile from birth to death was almost unknown to us. Letters written by him which have been preserved by a great-grandson of his student, A. Tanakadate, are now open to the public and offer many important facts about Fenton. Analyzing these twenty-two letters, we can describe Fenton's affairs during his stay in Japan and after his return to his homeland. The letters tell vividly his kind personality and intimate relationship to Tanakadate. He heartily appreciated nature, people and their kind hospitality in Japan and remembered them fondly throughout his life.

N2  - The larval stage of Sarbanissa venusta (Leech) and the seasonal appearance of the imago are described and compared to Sarbanissa yunnana (Mell) in Jizobaru Highland, Oita, Kyushu, Japan. Larvae of both species bore a close resemblance, but their food plants were different. S. venusta fed on Ampelopsis brevipedunculata Trautv. (Family Vitidaceae), while S. yunnana fed on Impatiens spp. (Family Balsaminaceae). S. venusta appeared only from the end of July to the end of August. On the other hand, S. yunnana was apparently represented by two generations, appearing from the end of May to the beginning of July, and from the end of July to the end of August. The larvae of both species showed aggregation habit, but in S. venusta the size of the group was sometime very large with more than 70 larvae. I observed a 'leader' in some groups, which was the first to shake its body to threaten an enemy; the other members immediately imitated the act.

N2  - There has been controversial issue on the classification of Chitoria sordida (Moore, 1866) and C. naga (Tytler, 1914). These species are similar to each other at a glance, but easily distinguishable. The diagnosis of each species is described. Chitoria sordida, ranging from Sikhim-Bhutan-Manipur to N. Myanmar (ssp. sordida) and from N. Vietnam to E. Laos (ssp. vietnamica) prefers lower altitude, ca 500m, whereas Chitoria naga, ranging from Nagaland-N. Myanmar-S. Yunnan-N. Thailand to N. Laos prefers higher altitude, ca 1,000-2,000m. The recently described C. sordida hani Yoshino, 1999 is sunk to a junior synonym of C. naga (Tytler, 1914). In addition, Chitoria modesta (Oberthur, 1906), often regarded as a subspecies of C. sordida, is separated from these two species.

N2  - Larvae of Sabahan Papilio memnon L. and P. polytes L. were reared under a photoperiod of 12L-12D or 14L-10D at 20℃. In both species, photoperiods affected pupal development, although there was no significant difference in the mean larval stages between photoperiodic conditions. In P. memnon, the pupal stage under the short day (23-27 days) was slightly but significantly longer than that under the long day (23-24 days). In P. polytes, four of nine individuals prolonged their pupal stages under the short day (29-92 days), while all individuals developed without arrest in development under the long day (19-21 days). The results show that these Papilio butterflies inhabiting the tropics near the equator have the ability to delay pupal development in response to a short photoperiod at the moderate temperature.

The galls were fed on by the larvae of two tortricid species, Lobesia aelopa Meyrick and Adoxophyes dubia Yasuda and the attack rate was less than 5%. In addition, since the larvae of the gall midge had already matured on 16 October and most larvae had egressed from the galls by 20 November, the tortricids imposed little negative effect on the cecidomyiid larvae. 2) Adoxophyes dubia emerged from the fruit galls of a cecidomyiid, Asteralobia sp. on the liana Trachelospermum asiaticum (Apocynaceae). The larva of A. dubia bored into and fed on gall tissue and the gall was considerably damaged. However, most cecidomyiid larvae matured or had already exited the galls. In addition, the attack rate was 8.3% (N=12). These two tortricid species are facultative cecidophages that primarily utilize normal plant tissues rather than plant galls. The tortricid larvae may feed on gall tissues as an alternative food source due to a dearth of fresh leaves in late autumn.

N2  - The photoperiodic response was investigated in two newly established populations of Papilio memnon in Shizuoka and Kanagawa Prefectures, central Japan. Critical photoperiods for inducing pupal diapause were about 13hr and 13hr 15min in the Shizuoka (35°02'N) and Kanagawa (35°16'N) populations, respectively, and these were not different from those of temperate populations in western Japan. Results show that the distribution of this species has been expanding from western into central Japan without any remarkable changes in such a physiological trait as the critical photoperiod for inducing pupal diapause.

N2  - Anchinia cristalis (Scopoli, 1763), a poorly known moth in Japan, is redescribed on the basis of specimens reared from larvae on leaves of Daphne jezoensis Maxim. (Thymelaeaceae) in Hokkaido, northern part of Japan. Information on its larval and pupal habit is given on the basis of observations on the Hokkaido population, throwing a doubt on previous reports. Proposals on the family-group placement of the genus Anchinia that were suggested in the past 30 years are reviewed and compared with each other. The proposal of Leraut (1997), placing Anchinia in the subfamily Hypercalliinae of the Oecophoridae sensu lato, is regarded as the most reasonable one at present.

N2  - We report here on lepidopteran larvae associated with two different types of leaf galls. 1) We examined the relationship between the structural features of one type of leaf gall and the feeding preference of two polyphagous caterpillars. On a Distylium racemosum (Hamamelidaceae) tree bearing leaf pouch galls formed by the aphid Neothoracaphis yanonis (Matsumura) (Homoptera, Aphididae) during the spring in an urban park, caterpillars belonging to the species Lymantria dispar (Linnaeus) and L. mathura Moore (Lymantridae) rested on its leaves. The galls were dehiscent, and most alates of the aphids had already escaped the galls. The galls showed no signs of having been attacked by lepidopteran larvae. We brought the larvae back to our laboratory, enclosed them in plastic cups containing D. racemosum galled shoots, and inspected the plant parts on which the larvae had fed. L. dispar and L. mathura larvae fed on normal leaf tissue and dehiscent openings on the underside of the galls but avoided feeding on their round upper surfaces. Since damage by caterpillars feeding on the galls was rare and occurred after alate emergence if at all, the caterpillars posed no negative effects for the aphids. 2) Leaf-roll galls of Phyllocolpa sp. (Hymenoptera, Tenthredinidae) on a Salix eriocarpa (Salicaceae) tree on a riverbank were sampled during the spring. Among them, 1.5% (N=206) had been attacked by the larvae of Clostera anachoreta ([Denis & Schiffermuller]) (Notodontidae), Orthosia angustipennis (Matsumura) (Noctuidae) and L. dispar, which are facultative cecidophages (gall-feeders). C. anachoreta and O. angustipennis had invaded and fed on the galls, while L. dispar had grazed on them from the outside. The impact as a result of moth larvae feeding on the survival and development of sawfly larvae was small, since the attack rate was only 1.5% and there was no gall in which sawfly larva died due to cecidophage feeding activity. The two gall formers in this study exhibited a low mortality attributable to the feeding activity of cecidophagous Lepidoptera. This might be as a result of the roundness and hardness characteristic of pouch galls produced by aphids, which deterred assault by the cecidophages, and because the relatively short developmental period of the sawfly larva reduced the chance of cecidophage attack.

Three species, Phylloporia bistrigella (Haworth, 1828), Excurvaria praelatella ([Denis & Schiffermuller], 1775) and Incurvaria vetulella (Zetterstedt, 1839) are newly recorded from Japan. The females of Paraclemensia oligospina Nielsen, 1982 and P. monospina Nielsen, 1982 are reported for the first time and the genitalia are described. The male and female genitalia of Incurvaria alniella (Issiki, 1957) and I. takeuchii Issiki, 1957 are described.

N2  - A species of the Apatulinae, Hestina nicevillei (Moore, 1896) was recently found in Ha-Giang, Northern Vietnam, and we here describe it as a new subspecies: Hestina nicevillei magna. It is also the first record of sympatry of the species with the allied species H. assimilis (Linnaeus, 1758). This subspecies is clearly distinguishable from other subspecies by its large size and much reduced black markings on the upperside of both wings, as well as a tiny, faint red submarginal spot on the hindwing reminiscent of the characteristic red markings of H. assimilis. It is known that H. nicevillei represents a classic case of Batesian mimicry, since the color pattern in all the subspecies hitherto known is remarkably similar to the local forms of Aporia agathon (Gray, 1831), which is considered to be offensive for birds. It is puzzling, however, that this model pierid species has thus far not been found in the area around Ha-Giang, although a large number of butterflies have been collected. On the other hand, Aporia giganthea Koiwaya, 1993, which is common there in spring, looks somewhat similar to ssp. magna in size and coloration. Furthermore, the white seasonal form of Hestina assimilis is also common, which at the first glance is almost indistinguishable from ssp. magna both in size and color pattern. Some possibilities regarding the origins of the unique features of H. nicevillei magna are discussed with special reference to the phenomena of mimicry and convergence.

N2  - Blastodacna ochrella sp. nov. is described on the basis of specimens collected in the eastern part of Hokkaido and in the central part of Honsyu, Japan. The anellus lobes of the male genitalia are parallel-sided on the basal half and abruptly tapering on the distal half. This character indicates that the species is much closer to B. lvovskyi Sinev, 1986 and B. mironovi Sinev, 1989 distributed in Central Asia, than to any of the congeneric species previously recorded in the Far East. Investigations into the vegetation at Miwa, Kosimizu-tyo, Hokkaido, where adult moths of the new species were very frequently collected, imply that the species is associated with Prunus sargentii or Sorbus alnifolia.

N2  - Two karyotypes and the number of their constituting chromosomes are examined in this paper for two Wagimo species (Lycaenidae, Lycaeninae, Theclini): W. signatus (Butler, 1881) from Japan and W. abei Koiwaya, 2002 from Myanmar. The diploid chromosome number is basically 2n, 42 in these two species, but that of the former varies from 2n, 42 to 44. A reduction in the basic number of chromosomes from 2n, 48 (the modal number in Lycaenidae) may partly be explained by fusion of chromosomes because four large chromosomes are observed in both species. Specimens of W. signatus with 2n, 44 have been found mainly in the Quercus serrata forests in Aomori Prefecture in Japan. An increase in the chromosome number from the basic 2n, 42 is considered to have occurred as the result of a breakage in two of the four large chromosomes.

In colouration, the holotype lies almost within the extent of variation observed in I. polliacola, while considerably differing from the other species of the genus. The new species is reliably distinguishable from I. polliacola by the structures of the valva and juxta of the male genitalia. It will possibly be separable from I. polliacola by the slight difference in the forewing colouration.

N2  - We have previously shown that the systemic injection of sodium tungstate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) inhibitor, to pupae immediately after pupation efficiently produces characteristic color-pattern modifications on the wings of the Painted Lady butterfly Vanessa cardui. In this species, the black spots reduced in size and eventually disappeared in response to the treatment. The observed modifications probably resulted from the prolonged activation of a signal transduction cascade initiated by a receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinase in scale cells. Here we observed that applying this method to the Small Copper butterfly Lycaena phlaeas daimio, the black spots in the ventral wings enlarged in size, which was in sharp contrast to the induced modifications in V. cardui. This type of modifications seen in L. phlaeas daimio has frequently been reported in many field-caught individuals of Lycaenidae. By simply examining the natural color-patterns of Japanese lycaenid butterflies, we here note that the enlargement of spots is related with speciation in this family. The most remarkable example can be found in the Japanese Maculinea species, M. teleius and M. arionides. While the former has small spots, the latter has "enlarged" spots in the ventral wings, which is reminiscent of the tungstate-treated modifications in L. phlaeas daimio. Since it has been proposed that a hypothetical transduction pathway with a PTPase for the scale-cell differentiation globally coordinates the wing-wide color-patterns, our findings suggest that spontaneous mutations in genes in this hypothetical pathway might have played a role in creating new color-patterns and species at lease in Lycaenidae.

N2  - Male mating behavior of the papilionid butterfly Graphium sarpedon was investigated using adult and paper models in the field and large greenhouse. First, mating behavior of this species was briefly described. Second, experiments with adult or paper models were carried out to examine what signals elicit male's courtship behavior. Flying males approached not only female model, but also male model although mating attempt by the males was frequently found for the female model. However, frequency of male's approach was lower on yellow-banded female model than on normally blue-banded female model, suggesting that blue color of a wing is essential for courtship by males. This hypothesis was elucidated by the experiments with paper model where various color papers were presented to flying males. Among various colors tested, blue and green colors, which were similar in spectral reflectance each other, were most effective for eliciting male's approach. Further, it became clear that color itself is important, but size, shape and color pattern of the models tested are not responsible. Olfactory cue seems to be responsible for mate recognition at a close distance. Therefore, the results suggest that in male mating behavior of G. sarpedon, blue color itself on a wing is important for mate finding and that the light irradiation including blue coloration of the wing has important significance in mating bahavior of the males.

N2  - We investigated the sex ratios of Sasakia charonda, rearing larvae of the fourth and sixth instars and pupae that were collected in the field. Wild adults detected along a census route were also examined for comparison. The sex ratios of emerged adults by rearing larvae of the fourth and sixth instars and pupae were found to be approximately 1:1, but the ratio of wild adults found along the census route was significantly biased towards males. In order to obtain more accurate results of the sex ratios of wild adults, we further counted the number of male and female adults in the other census sites. As the result, we found the trend that the greater number of males was detected in the specific sites but females were rare and even in every census site. The differences in adult distribution patterns between the male and the female might determine the male predominant sex ratio in sites along the census routes.

N2  - Eggs, larvae and pupae of Narathura bazalus (Ibaraki population) were reared at 17, 20, 23, 25 and 28℃ under long-day (LD 15:9) or short-day (LD 12:12) conditions. Egg periods were 6, 5 and 4 days at 20, 23 and 25℃, respectively. The developmental zero and the total effective temperature for egg development (from oviposition to egg-hatch) were 11.0℃ and 54.7 degree-days, respectively. Photoperiod affected the development of larvae and pupae. Under long-day condition, the average periods from egg-hatch to adult emergence were 64, 47, 36, 30 and 27 days at 17, 20, 23, 25 and 28℃, respectively. Under short-day condition, they were 61, 47, 36, 32 and 29 days, respectively. The periods at 17, 25 and 28℃ were significantly different between two photo-regimens. Under long-day condition, the developmental zero and the total effective temperature were 9.0℃ and 320 degree-days for larval development (from egg-hatch to pupation) and 9.9℃ and 171 degree-days for pupal development (from pupation to adult emergence), respectively. Under short-day condition, those values were 6.9℃ and 384 degree-days for larval and 8.3℃ and 196 degree-days for pupal development, respectively. In December, most pupae could emerge as adults when they were warmed, but no surviving pupae were shown in and after February. We concluded that N. bazalus might not pass winter in the pupal stage at least in the north part of Kanto district, central Japan. The significance of the photoperiodic response shown in the present study was discussed.

Concerning oviposition preference, two hundred canopy twigs and two hundred non-canopy twigs were examined in coppice forest habitat of Quercus serrata Thunb. at Moka City in Tochigi Prefecture. Eggs were found on non-canopy twigs, but not on canopy twigs. The leaves from the canopy twigs were tough and the density of trichomes on these leaves was high, compared with the non-canopy twigs, and the canopy leaves unfolded more quickly than non-canopy ones. However, when larvae were reared on leaves from each type of twigs, there were no significant differences in larval performance between the diets. Differences in physical characteristics such as toughness of leaves, density of trichomes and growing rate of the leaves between canopy twigs and non-canopy twigs had no effect on the larval performance of this species. Because the female adults of this species laid eggs on non-canopy twigs regardless of the plant phenology, and physical characteristics of the leaves, there must be unknown factors, besides quality of the host plant, that affect oviposition preference under normal field conditions.

N2  - We examined the phylogenetic relationships of 40 species of the genus Graphium (Papilionidae: Leptocircini) with a few related genera belonging to the tribe Leptocircini. The analysis is based on comparisons of morphological classification and about 700 base pairs of nuclear 28S ribosomal DNA and 793 base pairs of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene. In both 28S rDNA, the ND5 and the 28S rDNA+ND5 phylogenetic trees of Graphium butterflies, the genus Graphium was monophyletic, and diversification occurred at almost the same time. Although the subgenera Pazala, Pathysa and Arisbe were monophyletic clusters, the subgenus Graphium was not. The 28S rDNA sequence lengths of the eurypylus group belonging to this subgenus (represented in this study by G. doson, G. bathycles, G. chiron, G. evemon, G. leechi, G. eurypylus) and G. akikoae (=phidias) to the subgenus Pathysa are 713 bases, and differed from those of the other Graphium butterflies which are 717 bases. The phylogenetic tree positions of the eurypylus group+G. akikoae did not cluster with other subgenera, but rather independently. Therefore, we assumed that the eurypylus group did not belong in the subgenus Graphium. The current classification leaves a certain ambiguity in the classification of the African Graphium species, either all the African Graphium species being classified into the subgenus Arisbe (Miller, 1987), or the African species being classified into two groups, the non-swordtailed species in the subgenus Arisbe and the swordtailed species in the subgenus Graphium (Hancock, 1983, 1993). The present study assumes that the African species should be assigned to two groups represented by Hancock, one being the non-swordtailed species in the subgenus Arisbe (represented in this study by G. ridleyanus, G. latreillianus, G. angolanum, G. tynderaeus, G. leonidas, G. adamastor and G. schubotzi) and the other being the swordtailed species in the subgenus Graphium (represented in this study by G. policenes).

N2  - Recently mated male butterflies can not transfer as large a spermatophore as virgin males, and are much less rewarded by remating since a reduced spermatophore decreases paternity. In the present study, we tested a hypothesis that recently mated males should reduce their mating efforts until their spermathophore is replenished in the cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae crucivora Boisduval. The field experiments revealed that males who had mated on average 1.8 days previously searched for females less frequently than virgin males did, although the female-searching frequency of males who had mated on average 2.7, 4.3 and 5.3 days previously was not significantly different from that of virgins. That result indicated that the recently mated males refrain from the costly mate locating behavior, although the previous study reported that males usually mated even the day after copulation under laboratory condition where mate location is not necessary.

N2  - To understand the mortality rates and associated factors of overwintering larvae of the nymphalid butterfly, Sasakia charonda, we counted the number of dead larvae in the following categories of plots on the floor of a coppice from late November to the end of March; plots covered with mesh nets to prevent predation by natural enemies, a plot where fishing sinkers were put on dead leaves used as an overwintering site by larvae to prevent the leaves from being moved by any physical factors such as wind, and a control plot. To estimate the moving distance of dead leaves used by overwintering larvae, we put lead sinkers of the equivalent weight of one, two, or three larvae on dead leaves, which were marked on one side with paint, and set on the floor of the coppice in late November. Then the distance the dead leaves moved was measured at the end of March in the following year. To reveal the cold hardiness of the larvae during the first half of the overwintering season, the larval survival rates when the rearing temperature was lowered from 5℃ to 0℃, -5℃ and -10℃, gradually or rapidly, were investigated. To estimate the effects of frequency of water supply to the dead leaves used by larvae on larval survival, the survival rates were researched by varying the water supply, i.e. supplying water every day, once in four days, seven days, fifteen days, thirty days, or not at all. From these results, we examined the mortality factors of the larvae of S. charonda during overwintering.

N2  - As an incipient step to clarify gall-feeding habits in Lepidoptera of Japan, field sampling of three distinct types of galls in addition to field observation was conducted in the Kinki district, central Japan. The collected galls were reared in the laboratory to examine cecidophagous lepidopteran fauna. 1) In spinous twig-galls on Quercus acutissima (Fagaceae) trees by the gall wasp Trichagalma serratae (Ashmead) (Cynipidae, Hymenoptera), over half of the gall clumps (58.3-100%) were attacked by lepidopteran larvae. Four lepidopteran species, Characoma ruficirra (Hampson) (Noctuidae), Andrioplecta pulverula (Meyrick) (Tortricidae), Anatrachyntis japonica Kuroko (Cosmopterygidae) and Hypatima sp. (Gelechiidae), eclosed from the galls. The latter two species are first records from plant galls. A. japonica larvae fed on the lignified gall tissues and attacked larval cells of the gall wasps. Whether the larva of Hypatima sp. fed on the gall tissues or not was unclear. 2) From oval stem-galls on the herb Achyranthes japonica (Amaranthaceae) by the gall midge Lasioptera achyranthii Shinji (Cecidomyiidae, Diptera), Amaya stellata Butler (Noctuidae) larvae were found. A. stellata larvae fed on the epidermis of the galls, with infestation rates being only 0-3.5%, and therefore little affected gall midge larvae. 3) From spherical fruit-galls on the liana Ampelopsis brevipedunculata (Vitaceae) by the gall midge Asphondylia baca Monzen (Cecidomyiidae, Diptera), Nippoptilia vitis (Sasaki) (Pterophoridae) adults eclosed. A N. vitis larva could complete its growth in one gall. When larval attack was prior to eclosion of the gall midge, the midge larva died of the destruction of the gall by N. vitis. The infestation rate by N. vitis was 52.9%.

N2  - Larvae of the satyrine butterfly Lethe dina feed on blades of bamboo grass Sasa veitchii var. hirsuta whose blades have a two-to-four-year life span. I studied age class preference by L. diana. Both current-year blades and blades from previous years were used as oviposition sites by adult L. diana and as food by larvae. The ratio of young to old blades used changed seasonally, and these ratios were consistent with the ratio of young to old blades in available bamboo grass bushes during each season, i.e. neither adults nor larvae showed a preference for any age class of blades. Larvae grew better when they were fed young blades compared to old blades, so the fitness of L. diana would increase if young blades were selected. It is thought that L. diana is not particular about leaf age because it cannot discriminate between young blades and old blades.

N2  - In copulation, most Lepidoptera unite with their abdomens end-to-end, their heads pointing in opposite directions, and their forewings making slopes to both sides like a roof. We call it "roof type" copulation. However, the slope of the roof varies according to differences in length of the body and size of the wings. In a typical case "female's wings cover male's wings (FCM)" or conversely "male's wings cover female's (MCF)". In these cases, the female always occupies the upper side with her head pointing upward during copulation on inclined slope or vertical surface. We call this "female dominant (FD)". "Male dominant (MD)" is possible but very exceptional. Females always keep the position FD with very rare exception. In the case of wing arrangement, FCM is apparently dominant, but often MCF occurs under natural condition. We classify copulation in Lepidoptera, especially nocturnal moths, into five postures as follows: Subtype 1-Typical roof type (RT); Subtype 2-1-V-shaped posture (VSP); Subtype 2-2-Face-to-face posture (FFP); Subtype 3-1-Horizontal wing posture (HWP); and Subtype 3-2-Butterfly posture (BP). All subtypes may be derived from a primitive RT; Subtype 1 is the true RT in the strict sense. In Subtype 2, the heads of both sexes point upward when resting on inclined slope or vertical surface. VSP is V-shaped copulation, in which the male approaches the female laterally, hence their bodies make a V shape. In FFP, the male later on moves to his partner's ventral side and assumes face-to-face posture. In HWP, as the wing size becomes larger, and the abdomen size becomes slender, the slope of RT is reduced gradually, finally becoming almost horizontal. If during copulation, the pair's wings are held horizontally, we call it HWP. And in BP, the pair's wings are held upright on their backs.

N2  - In butterflies, male wings are said to be more conspicuous or occasionally more brilliant than those of females (Darwin, 1874). However, the males of Narathura bazalus distributed from the Himalayas to Japan appear to have mostly black wings, whereas females possess a conspicuous blue mark on the forewing. This species, along with two related species N. japonica and Panchala ganesa, was examined for possible reflection of UV light. Specimens were photographed in UV light and also analyzed by spectrophotometry. N. bazalus males clearly reflected UV light from the whole dorsal surface of the fore- and hindwings, and sexual difference in dorsal colors was large in N. bazalus and small in N. japonica with no difference in P. ganesa.

N2  - The meiotic chromosomes of seven charaxine species belonging to the genera Archaeoprepona, Prepona and Agrias from Brazil and Peru were investigated with primary and secondary spermatocytes. The haploid numbers of chromosomes were found to be n=16 for Archaeoprepona demophon and Ar. demophoon, n=15 for Ar. licomedes, n=9 for Ar. amphimachus and Ar. meander, n=12 for Prepona pheridamas and Agrias claudina All these Neotropical butterflies contained one to ten large-sized chromosomes in their metaphase plates. In view of the correlation between choromosome size and modal number of chromosomes (n=31) in Nymphalidae, the large-sized chromosomes noticed here might have been formed through chromosome fusion, which resulted in decrease of chromosome number.

The diurnal activity of this race is somewhat similar to that of the subsp. kiyosumiensis Takahashi & Aoyama. The forewing length of the summer form is very large, similar to the races of Mt Oe (Kyoto) and Mt Sambe (Shimane), especially in the female. The colouration of the wing underside, in the summer form, probably, is the palest among all the races of this species in Japan.

N2  - The structural scales that give rise to the characteristically vivid green, blue or violet iridescent colours of some 47 species of Lycaenidae and 7 species of Riodinidae have been examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Most species of Lycaenidae examined produce iridescent colours via a multilayer elaboration within the lumen of the scale into a Urania-type microstructure. The multilayers were found to be perforated and possess a characteristically complex and typical microstructure, referred to as a pepper-pot structure. In addition, colour production by a Morpho-type structure was unexpectedly found in some species of the subfamily Lycaeninae. This microstructure results from an elaboration of flutes on the ridges and is quite distinct from Morpho-type scales found in the Riodinidae, which are derived from scutes. The phylogenetic and taxonomic usefulness of scale microstructure is considered and it is speculated that within Lycaeninae Morpho-type scales may have evolved by transition from Urania-type scales.

N2  - I have observed territorialism in Polygonia c-aureum (Nymphalidae). The outermost area connected with the one minute interval activity loci was treated as the "core area" (individuals staying over five minutes were treated as its owners). The average size of core area has varied from 30-181m^2 from late March to early May. The owner of the core area showed four patterns of behaviour, spiralling to the male of same species, courtship behaviours to the female of same species, and short chase or disregard of the other species. The core areas were defended by spirallings against males of the same species, so it is recognizable as "territory" (any defended area; Noble, 1939). Territories were held on sunny days in one season (March to May), in one daily period (12:30-15:00) and in one environment (sunlit forest edge). So there is a territorialism in overwintering populations of this species. It would be one of the mate-locating tactics.

N2  - Intra-species variation in Thymelicus lineola was investigated using gene analysis. Conjunction of mitochondrial genes encoding 16s rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) revealed variation in a region-dependent manner, and two major groups were found. One is a group consisting of individuals distributed in the Far East, and another is a group made up of those distributed in Europe and North America. Individuals recently found in Hokkaido, Japan were regarded as members of the latter group. We discussed the origin of Hokkaido's T. lineola using these molecular data and statistical data on importation of grass, host plants of T. lineola.

These moths were thought to hatch before the bud break and utilize the galls as an alternative food resource, since they are usually foliage feeders on young leaves.

N2  - The nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genes encoding 16s rRNA (16s) and NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) were analyzed for 30 species in the genus Erebia. A molecular phylogenetic tree inferred from conjunction of 16s and ND1 gene sequences (735 base pair in total) suggested that the genus Erebia is divided into at least three clusters. We tentatively call the clusters a typical Erebia, an atypical Erebia and a far Erebia, respectively. The typical Erebia includes 23 out of 30 species analyzed, implying that this is the main group of the genus Erebia. The atypical Erebia consists of E. sibo, E. kalmuka, E. meta, E. turanica, E. radians, which are species mainly distributed in high-altitude regions of Central Asia. The far Erebia consists of E. wanga and E. rossii, and these two species have a common feature in the spot of their forewings. There are seven sub-groups in the typical Erebia. One of the sub-groups, which consists of E. neriene, E. niphonica, E. alcmena and E. aethiops, is further analyzed using a mitochondrial gene encoding NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5). We make a particular discussion on this sub-group in the present study.

N2  - Butterfly watching was carried out at a small house garden of Fujimigaoka New Town, Oita City, for three years from 1998 to 2000. In contrast to the "route census method", we did not have a fixed time for butterfly observation because of working during the daytime in another place, and also not always being at home during holidays. Hence, observation was carried out only at certain times. However, we fixed an observation place in the garden of Miyata's house and several meters around it to be able to watch and to identify butterflies. Even under such limiting conditions, a total of fifty species of butterfly was observed in the garden during the period. In the present paper, yearly and monthly appearances of each species and also frequency of its numbers were evaluated by total number of appearance days in each year and for three years, and the number of individuals in each half month classified into three grades as shown in Table 1. The number of butterfly species observed during the holiday was always more than that on weekdays. During the summer season, most of the butterflies, about 70 to 100% of butterflies seen in a day, appeared before noon, especially from eight to ten o'clock in the morning. We believe that if during every holiday the observer could stay in his house until ten o'clock in the morning, he could observe almost all species that would appear in his garden in a year. Therefore, our method may be recommended as a useful method of monitoring butterflies instead of the "route census method".

N2  - To examine the relationships between the northward distributional expansion of the great mormon butterfly, Papilio memnon Linnaeus, and climatic warming in Japan, we analyzed a data set on temperatures near the northern range limit of the species for the past ca 60 years from the year 1940 until 1998. Within the distributional range of the species in southwestern Japan in the year 2000, a significant increase in temperature (i.e., climatic warming) occurred and a significant increase in the latitude of the northern range margins was detected during the period analyzed. That is, the latitude of northern range margins in the species increased with the increasing mean temperature of the coldest month and annual mean temperature in southwestern Japan. Thus, it is suggested that climatic warming as a major external factor may have played an important role in its northward expansion. The averages of annual mean temperatures and mean temperatures of the coldest month near the northern range margins were 15.46℃ and 4.51℃, respectively. Our analysis also suggested that there were different types of northward range expansion patterns of the species. We discuss the patterns mainly from the point of external factors.

N2  - The fluttering and feeding activities of Shijimiaeoides divinus asonis were observed in the Aso area of Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan. The peak population increased during periods of light rainfall during the April-May period of very high temperatures. Fluttering activity was correlated with sunlight intensity. The five species of plants were recorded as nectar sources for the first time. The favored colors of flowers were purple, yellow, and white in order of frequency. The butterflies may show a preference for feeding on the same flowers rather than different ones. Fluttering and feeding activities reduced between 12:30 and 13:30. To maintain the habitat of this butterfly, it is important to conserve Trifolium repens, as it is a favored source of nectar.

N2  - Blue-green coloration in larval integument and adult wing of Graphium sarpedon and some pigments responsible for the coloration were investigated in various light conditions. When larvae were reared under high intensity (5,000lux), the integument became green in color while it was yellow when the larvae were reared in darkness. The degree of green coloration depended on the intensity and period of irradiation. Blue-green coloration of the band region on the adult wing was also induced by light irradiation during adult development. Without irradiation, color of the band region was pale-yellow. In the larval integument as well as the adult wing of light-irradiated animals, blue pigment was found as a form of protein binding, and it seems to be sarpedobilin, which has been known as a kind of neopterobilin. These observations strongly suggest that light stimulates the accumulation of sarpedobilin in each tissue of G. sarpedon.

N2  - One of the alpine butterflies, Erebia niphonica is distributed on some high mountains in central and northern Japan. It is found in some particular habitats in the alpine and "pseudo-alpine" zone of the high mountains in northern Honshu. In the first paper the authors aimed to examine the floral communities of the habitat of Erebia niphonica based on a field survey. A total of over 100 sites of the habitats is recognized, and it emerges that these habitats are located on five particular floral communities. In this second paper it is also studied that the relations of the vertical distribution pattern of Erebia niphonica and vegetation zone lacking the subalpine coniferous forest in the regions of heavy snowfall on the Sea of Japan side of northern Honshu, on the basis of ecological angle. Horizontal distribution of Abies mariesii, a major tree in subalpine coniferous forest and Erebia niphonica is also discussed.

N2  - Chemical analyses were conducted of male scent of Pieris napi collected in two districts, Yamaguchi Prefecture and Hokkaido. The androconial secretion of most individuals of Yamaguchi population comprised well-known compounds, linalool, nerol, neral and geranial, whereas some other males were found to secrete different and as yet unidentified monoterpenic components. We designate the former as Type I, and the latter, Type II. Further investigation on Hokkaido population revealed that it is of Type II. These findings are suggestive of the presence of at least two strains of P. napi of which male androconial secretion is chemically polymorphic.

N2  - Delias is one of the genera belonging to Pieridae, which is well known for bright wing markings considered as aposematic colors. A list of Delias butterflies cohabiting in some localities of the highlands of New Guinea Island (New Guinea) is presented, to demonstrate that their marked diversification and cohabitance are general features of this genus in that region. The mechanism of their remarkable speciation has been considered to be allopatric and we demonstrate it by presenting a typical example. Such distinct differences presented as a typical example, however, have not been observed in the mountains of Southeast Asia. Therefore, we suggest that other mechanisms, which remain unclarified, underlie the peculiar diversification of Delias butterflies and the maintenance of their cohabitance in New Guinea.

N2  - Flight season of Atrophaneura alcinous was compared between the lowland and mountain populations in the Kanto District, eastern Japan. Occurrence of the early stages in A. alcinous and its host-plant seasonality were also investigated in the field. In the lowland population of Fuchu (50m in altitude), which uses Aristolochia debilis, adults are seen from late April to early October with four peaks of flight, while in the mountain population of Gotenba (800m in altitude) using different host-plant species, Ar. kaempferi, adult flight occurred from mid May to early September with two peaks, showing a high peak followed by a low one. Timing of occurrence of eggs and larvae approximately corresponded to the season of adult flight. For host plants, Ar. debilis had new and tender leaves throughout the season, while Ar. kaempferi grew new and relatively tender leaves during May and June and then stopped growing young veins and leaves. The results suggest that flight season of this butterfly depends not only on air temperature, but also on the adaptation to host-plant species showing different quality and phenology.

N2  - A sympatric distribution of similar butterflies, P. stubbendorfii and P. citrinarius, is formed in central Hokkaido. In these areas, butterflies with yellow body hairs, an intermediate character between the two species, are frequently found in the butterfly population and thought to be natural hybrids between the two species. Here, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA, which is maternally inherited in eukaryotes, of butterflies with yellow body hairs to clarify their maternal species. The mitochondrial ND5 gene sequences from all five butterflies corresponded to those from P. citrinarius, indicating that their mothers were P. citrinarius. This finding supports the earlier findings from artificial hybridization studies, which suggested that butterflies with yellow body hairs from the habitats for both species must be natural hybrids between female P. citrinarius and male P. stubbendorfii.

N2  - Distribution of Luehdorfia puziloi inexpecta at Mt Akagi was first confirmed in 1940. Since then, there have been remarkable changes in the environment supporting its habitat and the population has undergone rapid degradation. Changes in the utilization of land at Mt Akagi were investigated, and it became clear that the main cause of the population degradation was the replacement and fragmentation of the broad-leaved deciduous forest habitat by coniferous forests and agricultural fields. The situation was also further aggravated by the decrease in the number of foresters. To prevent further population decrease, the method of 'protective netting' covering of food plant and eggs was examined, and good results were obtained. This method was found to be an effective conservation approach for urgently minimizing impermanent population decreases.

N2  - Larvae of Parantica sita were reared with 5 mixtures of a ready-made diet material, Insecta F-II (Nihon-Nosan-Kogyo Co.), and 10 or 30% dried leaf powder from three host plants, Cynanchum caudatum, Metaplexis japonica, and Marsdenia tomentosa (Asclepiadaceae). The larval mortalities were high in the diets with 10% leaf powder of C. caudatum and M. japonica, and 25% of the butterflies were abnormal in the diets with 30% leaf powder of C. caudatum. By contrast, the rates of adult emergence were high (100 and 97%) and most adults were healthy looking in the diets with 30% leaf powder of M. japonica and M. tomentosa. Since M. japonica is common in Japan, an artificial diet made from M. japonica seems to be the most convenient for the mass rearing of P. sita.

N2  - Observation of behavioral interactions between sexes is important for understanding of the color patterns of butterfly wings. Such observation, however, is very rare for the Zephyrus hairstreaks which sometimes show conspicuous sexually dimorphic coloration on their wings. Copulation of a dimorphic species Neozephyrus japonicus was observed in a large wire-net cage in the Museum of Nature and Human Activities, Hyogo. Out of 12 males and 10 females released, two males attempted copulation, and one successfully copulated with one female during the observation period from June 11 to 13, 1999. The copulation time was about 3h. A large spermatophore was later confirmed in the bursa copulatorix by dissection of the female abdomen. Significance of induction of copulation in the Zephyrus hairstreaks is discussed.

N2  - The microdistribution of butterflies may be affected by food distribution, microclimatically favourable spots, or mate-locating sites. When butterflies' needs for these factors change, their microdistribution may change. In the satyrine butterfly Lethe diana, a multivoltine species, a seasonal change was observed in the factors that determine the microdistribution of adult butterflies. The microdistribution of every generation was mainly affected by the distribution of sap fluxes, resulting in a patchy butterfly population. The spatial arrangement of habitat patches also changed seasonally. Patches extended into the forest only for the July-August generation, due to seasonal changes in preferred light conditions. To avoid excessive increases in body temperature, the July-August generation of butterflies preferred dark sites within the forest. Generations from other months preferred more sunny sites, so their distribution was limited to near the forest edge. The microdistribution of males of the May-June generation was also affected by territoriality: territories were settled at relatively open sites along the forest edge.

N2  - Flower visiting activities of Papilio protenor were observed in the butterfly house at Biopark of Adachi, Tokyo on Oct. 24, Oct. 25, Dec. 24 in 1998 and Jan. 29 in 1999. Their activities showed two peaks when they were depressed by high air temperature and radiant heat, while on the other hand they showed a single peak when they were depressed by low air temperature and radiant heat. These results suggested that their activities were influenced by radiant heat and air temperature more than light intensity. On the other hand the peaks of the flower visiting activities of female butterflies were not clear. Female flower visiting activities seemed not to be so strongly affected by environmental factors as male activities.

N2  - The larvae of Fixsenia iyonis surugaensis were reared at 15℃ and 25℃ respectively. After emergence of the adults, lengths of the forewing, hindwing and tail were measured and compared between the specimens reared at 15℃ and 25℃. Compared with those of the adults reared at 25℃, the forewing and hindwing lengths of the adults reared at 15℃ were longer on average. On the other hand, the tail length was much shorter in the adults reared at 15℃ than at 25℃. It is probable that the tail length of the adult F.i. surugaensis is due to the rearing temperature in the larval stage.

N2  - In Japan, the butterfly Eurema hecabe (L.) consists of two separate groups (subtropical and temperate), and these groups differ in the fringe color (brown or yellow type) of the forewing upperside and are linked with expression of seasonal wing morph and with host-plant utilization. It was recently found that these two types show sympatric distribution on subtropical Okinawa-jima Island, and sexual isolation exists between them. In the present paper, the possibility of mating was investigated among populations of two types in Okinawa-jima I. and its adjacent islands (Ishigaki-jima I. and Honshu) in the laboratory. 1) Mating did not occur between the brown and yellow types of Okinawa-jima I. 2) The brown-type females of Okinawa-jima I. did not mate with the males of Ishigaki-jima I. or Honshu, while 3) the yellow-type females of Okinawa-jima I. mated with the allopatric males of Ishigaki-jima I. or Honshu. However, 4) females of both Ishigaki-jima I. (brown type) and Honshu (yellow type) mated with the males of allopatric populations (Honshu and Ishigaki-jima I.) except those of the brown type of Okinawa-jima I. These results are discussed from the viepoint of evolution of sexual isolation.

Cyaniris dilectus hermonthis Fruhstorfer, 1909 and Celaenorrhinus sumitra ratna Fruhstorfer, 1908 are here proposed as protected names (nom. protect.) against Cyaniris tappanus Matsumura, 1907 and Notocrypta kawakamii Matsumura, 1907, respectively, although the exact synonymy of Notocrypta kawakamii Matsumura, 1907 and Celaenorrhinus sumitra ratna Fruhstorfer, 1908 remains unresolved. Cyaniris arisanus Matsumura, 1910, in the current status as Celastrina oreas arisana (Matsumura, 1910), is regarded as a junior synonym and a homonym of Cyaniris arisanus Matsumura, 1907. Ypthima motschulskyi formosicola Matsumura, 1929 presented as a replacement name for Ypthima formosana Matsumura, 1907 is treated as a junior synonym of Ypthima multistriata Butler, 1883 and Rapala nissa formosanella Matsumura, 1929 is sunk to a junior synonym of Rapala hirayamana Matsumura, 1926.

This paper aims to examine the floral communities of the habitat of Erebia niphonica based on the field survey. A total of over 100 sites of the habitats is recognized, and it is found that these habitats are classified into the five plus one particular floral communities (one is restricted to Mts Hayachine). The ecological relationship between distribution of remnant snowpack and Erebia niphonica is also examined.

Attracted males were hovering near the synthetic sex attractant lures, but never touched them. Males were attracted to the synthetic sex attractant lures not only before sunset, but also at daytime under low illuminance. This suggests that male attraction is stimulated by decrease of illuminance.

N2  - A new gelechioid species, Idioglossa polliacola Sugisima, is described from Japan, with a series of figures and photos. Biology of the new species is also described on the basis of observation by the authors, with a series of photos. One of the most impressive features on its biology is the characteristic and complex larval nest constructed on the leaf of the food-plant, commelinaceous Pollia japonica, and remarks are made concerning the adaptive significance of the larval nest. The genus Idioglossa has been assigned to Oecophoridae in the last two decades, but the genus is most likely to belong to a batrachedrid subfamily Batrachedrinae in the latest taxonomic system. The genus and family are new to Japan.

N2  - 'Sleep' behavior of butterflies at night was observed in 46 individuals belonging to 13 species in 1999 at my house garden. The main sleeping place of Papilio xuthus receives little sunshine, having a high humidity, and is windless compared with the other areas. This species slept hanging from a twig of the tree or at the top of a grass stem 60-150cm high, and usually kept its wings closed. I observed two cases that seemed to be the same individual spending two nights on the same spot. Argyreus hyperbius slept with its wings closed and selected a twig 150-200cm high. This species probably spent two nights at the same spot like P. xuthus. Therefore, I believe that those species had an exact memory of the sleeping place of the previous night, hence they came back to sleep the next evening. Eurema hecabe always slept with its wings closed and hanging from the underside of a leaf of short grass. They preferred a rather dry and open place. Zizeeria maha always slept with both wings closed at the top of a short grass stem 40-50cm high.

N2  - Pupal diapause was investigated in several populations of Atrophaneura alcinous at the Kanto District, eastern Japan. First, photoperiodic response curve for diapause induction differed between the populations of Kamakura (lowlands habitat) and Gotenba (mountain habitat). For the Kamakura population, photoperiodic response was of the long-day type, and critical photoperiod was about 13.5hr at 25℃, and 14.5hr at 20℃. On the other hand, for the Gotenba population, although the response was of the long-day type, about 60% of pupae entered diapause under a long-day photoperiod of 15L-10D or 16L-8D at 20℃. Similar diapause occurrence at cool temperature under a long-day photoperiod was found in other mountain populations. Second, effects of pupal chilling and photoperiod on termination of pupal diapause were also compared between the Kamakura and Gotenba populations. The results show that although effect of chilling was slight, pupae terminated earlier under long-day photoperiod than short-day one in both populations, and that pupal period was longer in the Gotenba than in the Kamakura population. Therefore, it is suggested that incidence and termination of pupal diapause vary between the local populations. These differences are discussed from the viewpoints of altitude and host adaptation.

N2  - Overwintering sites and the larval stadia of two nymphuline species, Elophila interruptalis and Neoshoenobia testacealis, were examined at Midorogaike Pond, Kyoto, Central Honshu, by collecting their two host leaves, Brasenia schreberi and Nuphar subintegerrimum from late autumn, 1998 to early spring, 1999 and in November and December, 1999. Elophila interruptalis hibernated in the 3rd or 4th instar larvae within their cocoons, each with one piece of leaf fragment attaching to a leaf or rarely to a stem of Brasenia schreberi, while the larvae of Neoschoenobia testacealis were inside the submerged leaves or in the petioles of Nuphar subintegerrimum at the 2nd instar. The larvae of both species began to develop in April, depending on new floating leaves.

N2  - Species richness and diversity of fruit-feeding butterflies in six different forest types in Kinabalu National Park, Sabah (Borneo) were compared. The six sampling sites were situated in a primary rainforest, another old-grown forest of unknown history, three successional forests after commercial logging activities (approx. 30, 15, and 5 years ago), and a farmland site next to a local village. Butterflies were caught alive in traps using rotten bananas as bait. Species diversity was measured by Fisher's α of the logarithmic series. Species total was estimated by the "MMMeans"-method (Colwell, 1997). The primary forest contained most species and the highest diversity, on the farmland site the lowest number of species was found. The secondary forest sites were intermediates between the former two habitats with regard to their diversity and species richness, with the 15 year old site showing a more diverse fauna than the 30 or 5 year old site. Although almost none of the differences in diversity can be considered statistically significant (presumably due to low sample sizes), the results show patterns of diversity that correspond well with data for other Lepidoptera taxa (Geometridae, Pyralidae) from the same sites. If pseudoreplicates had not been recognized by individual marking of the butterflies, confidence limits for α-values would have been underestimated, and α-values themselves overestimated in most cases. The degree of deviation from true values differs between the habitats. For two fruit-feeding nymphalid butterflies, we reported maximum life spans of 45 (Neorina lowii), respectively 41 days (Basserona dunya).

Ypthima formosana Matsumura, 1907 and Ypthima formosana Fruhstorfer, 1908 are primary homonyms, but Y. formosana Matsumura, 1907 is better treated invalid as a nomen oblitum and Y. formosana Fruhstorfer, 1908 should be retained as a nomen protectum in order to stabilize the modern usage of the scientific name, because the former appeared only once in the original description, and Matsumura himself had never cited this name in his subsequent papers. The lectotype of the latter is designated for identification of two species confused under Y. formosana Fruhstorfer. The full descriptions of the early stages and adults of Y. angustipennis sp. nov. are presented.

N2  - To clarify the structure and organization of butterfly communities. I analyzed a transect-count data set of seven butterfly communities in varying types of woodland habitat at the northern foot of Mt Fuji, central Japan. The results of statistical analyses including UPGMA suggested that the butterfly community was composed of four species subgroups that showed either relatively high abundances and wide local distributions (subgroup IV), relatively low abundances and wide local distributions (subgroups I and III), or relatively low abundances and restricted local distributions (subgroup II). The result of PCA suggested that the extent of growth in the mantle and sleeve plant communties (i.e. the degree of development of forest edges (corresponding to ecotone))in each habitat played the major role in the diversification, formation, and organization of the four species subgroups. The two species subgroups IV and II, although quite different in abundance and distribution patterns, both had a great influence on the variations in the community indices such as species richness (total number of species) and total population abundance among the seven transect sites. whereas the other two subgroups I and III did not. From the analysis of the habitat types associated with the component species of the four species subgroups, it may be suggested that the differences in population abundances among the four species subgroups could be interpreted in terms of the sources and sinks theory (e.g. Pulliam, 1988). Overall, my analysis demonstrates that statistical approaches, including multivariate analysis, are very effective in the analysis of the structure and organization of butterfly communities.

N2  - Adult behavior of Luehdorfia japonica Leech (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae) was studied by the mark-release-recapture method in the habitat at Toyono-cho, Osaka Prefecture, Japan from the middle of April to the beginning of May, 1996. The adults were captured at the emergence site in the habitat at the foot of a hill (400m a.s.l.)and at the peak (530m a.s.l.) where territorial males were observed. The number of adults captured and marked was 15 for males and 8 for females, and that of recapture was 10 and 4, respectively, during the study period. The males had a tendency to move from the emergence site at the foot to the peak of the hill, and to remain at the peak for territorial behavior. The virgin females also appeared at the peak and mated with a patrolling male at the site. These results may indicate that both males and females of the adults move from their emergence site to the peak for the purpose of mating. A mated female was recaptured at the other side of the foot 1km distant from the marked site 8 days after release. This suggests that the mated females disperse from their emergence site to the other site.

The flower visiting activities of Idea leuconoe showed two peaks in the morning and afternoon on a fine day. But on a cloudy day, their activities showed a unimodal peak at noon. These results suggest that their activities were depressed by high temperature. In Anosia genutia, the flower visiting activities were not depressed by high temperature on a fine day. But, their activities were more depressed by low light intensity and low temperature than in I. leuconoe on a cloudy day.

N2  - Daily activity and mating behavior of Nemophora ahenea Stringer were investigated during August and September 1997 at two sites in the Kinki district, Honshu, Japan. Males were observed swarming only around sunset. This species behaved as a "swarming species" but a single hovering male was seen to copulate aerially with a female which flew up to the male from the ground. It is suggested that the act of swarming may not be a prerequisite for mating in this species. The relationship between size of the eyes and mating behavior of adelid moths is discussed.

N2  - The wing pattern of the central to northern Honshu populations of Neptis pryeri Butler is analyzed and compared with that of continental specimens from China to Korea. In central to northern Honshu specimens, the postdiscal white band on the underside of the hindwing is relatively narrow, and the submarginal row of white spots on the underside of the hindwing is reduced or disappearing. In these points, the central to northern Honshu populations are well separated from the nominotypical subspecies of N. pryeri from China to Korea.

N2  - The flower visiting activities of Idea leuconoe, Ideopsis similis and Anosia genutia (Lepidoptera, Danaidae) to artificial flowers were observed in the butterfly house. The flower visiting activities of I. leuconoe showed two peaks in the morning and afternoon. Their activities were depressed by environmental factors. The preference to color was concentrated in red and pink. In I. similis, the flower visiting activities showed a unimodal peak from 11:00 to 11:30. The color preference was yellow but flower visiting activities were recognized in other colors. The flower visiting activities of A. genutia peaked from 11:30 to 12:00 but sometimes the butterflies visited flowers in the afternoon. The preference on color was yellow and red.

N2  - Fringe color, seasonal wing-morph and adult size of Eurema hecabe (L.) were investigated in wild-caught individuals from Okinawa-jima Island. Butterflies with different fringe-color types (brown and yellow types) for the forewing upperside existed sympatrically on this island while those from Isigaki-jima I. were only of the brown type and those from Honshu (Tokyo) were of the yellow type. Seasonal morph variation was also different between these two types as well as those of the Ishigaki-jima I. population and of the Honshu population, which differed from each other. In particular, this difference was clearer in individuals caught in the autumn season than in the summer one. Furthermore, each type of adult females seemed to utilize different host plants. Thus, whether individuals with these different characters sympatrically inhabiting Okinawa-jima I. are different forms within one species or belong to a separate species is a very interesting problem and should be re-investigated in future.

Because the characteristics of the specimens from the Malay peninsula and Sumatra which we recently obtained are different from those of the Javanese specimens, the agnis complex should be treated as two species, E. agnis and E. tinna, as shown by Fruhstorfer (1906, 1913).

There were considerable differences in morphology among populations, and wing length contributed most to the differences. Pattern of geographic variation was unrelated to the geographical distances between populations. It was suggested that wings became relatively longer eastward. Evolutionary significance of these results is argued.

N2  - We examined the specimens of the genus Parnassius, Papilionidae, collected by the late Mr Toshiro Haruta in Nepal, and found some new or little known taxa. They are: P. stoliczkanus Felder & Felder from Mahakali, the westernmost region of Nepal, P. simo Gray and P. acdestis Grum-Grshimailo from Khumbu, north-east Nepal, and P. simo Gray from Mechi, the easternmost region of Nepal. In this paper, we describe three new subspecies as follows: P. stoliczkanus harutai, P. simo kanoi and P. simo kangchenus. We also found that P. stoliczkanus nobuko Ohya should belong to P. stenosemus Honrath both in the wing markings and male genitalia, confirming the treatment made by Inomata (1998). Also, a single female specimen of P. acdestis horikatsuhikoi Shinkai from Khumbu is recorded and discussed in terms of geographical variation.

N2  - All Japanese species of Adoxophyes were re-examined with emphasis on the male and female genitalia. A. fasciata Walsingham is treated as a subspecies of A. orana (Fischer von Roslerstamm). A tortricid pest of tea in Japan, previously treated as 'the tea form of orana' or 'Adoxophyes sp., the smaller tea tortrix', is taxonomically re-examined and described here as a new species, A. honmai sp. nov. A. dubia sp. nov. is also described from southern Japan, and is closely related to A. honmai sp. nov., with which it has been confused in the past. Adult and genitalia of each sex are figured for three species.

N2  - The haploid chromosome complements of spermatocytes were investigated for four species of Arhopala (Arhopalini, Lycaenidae) from Thailand. Three of them had an n, 24-karyotype and the remaining one, an n, 26-karyotype. The whole configurations of their chromosome complements in the first division were shown in the figures. The haploid complement of atrax (n, 26) was featured with the inclusion of a single chromosome easily distinguished; it was much smaller in size than the rest and, therefore, the smallest in the complement. No such chromosomes were observed in three other species investigated.

N2  - It is shown that East Asia is inhabited by two similar species of the Erebia (ligea Linnaeus, 1758) group, well differing in the male genitalia structure as well as a number of the wing pattern details. They are E. ligea Linnaeus, 1758 and the second sympatric species, which has a priority name Erebia ajanensis Menetries, 1875, stat. nov., nec Effinger, 1907, nec Warren, 1936, nec Kurentzov, 1950, 1970, and on a preliminary review seems to be represented by three subspecies: the nominotypical, known from a type series from Ayan (the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk in the Khabarovskii Krai Province, Russia), ssp. kosterini P. Gorbunov, Korshunov et Dubatolov, 1995 (=Erebia kosterini) in the southern Magadan Province, Russia, and ssp. arsenjevi Kurentzov, 1950 (=Erebia ligea arsenjevi) in more southerly regions of the Russian Far East, Korea, N and NE? China. The lectotypes of E. ajanensis, E. ligea arsenjevi (that is E. ajanensis arsenjevi) and of E. ligea koreana Matsumura, 1928 have been designated, as well as that of E. eumonia Menetries, 1859. The latter taxon was described on a heterogeneous series including both species, E. ligea and E. ajanensis. After lectotype designation the name eumonia became the valid one for an eastern subspecies of E. ligea, ranging from the Altai Mts (except for the north part) to the Magadan Province of Russia and Korea. All the subspecies of the true E. ligea described from this vast territory, except for E. ligea sachalinensis Matsumura, 1919, E. ligea rishirizana Matsumura, 1928 and E. ligea takanonis Matsumura, 1909, are considered as synonyms of E. ligea eumonia.

N2  - Study of literature and of specimens, mainly in the collection of the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam (ZMA), lead to the following conclusions and alterations. The correct name of Pachliopta neptunus from N.E. Sumatra is Pachliopta neptunus siborangitana (Tsukada & Nishiyama, 1980) because P. neptunus sumatrana Hagen is suppressed as invalid by homonymy. Since Graphium milon (C. & R. Felder, 1864) is a nomen nudum the correct name for this species becomes Graphium anthedon (C. & R. Felder, 1864). A review of the species is given. The suggestion is made to treat Graphium monticolum Fruhstorfer as a distinct species for Nature Conservation reasons and its uncertain status. Papilio demoleus Linnaeus is 'successfully' introduced in Java and two specimens of Graphium weiskei Ribbe are found on Java, Rembang. The female of Graphium encelades (Boisduval) is figured for the first time. And finally Papilio polytes alpheios Jordan appears to be synonymous to Papilio alphenor perversus Rothschild, whose range extends from N. Sulawesi, Minahasa to the Talaud Islands. Papilio polytes alcindor Oberthur also occurs in N. Sulawesi and maybe in Sangihe.

N2  - A rearing experiment on the chestnut tiger butterfly, Parantica sita (Lepidoptera, Danaidae), was made under a photoperiod of 12L-12D or 16L-8D at 15, 20 or 25℃. Mean egg, larval and pupal stages were about 5, 7 and 12; 18, 23 and 40; and 10, 15 and 27 days, at 25, 20 and 15℃, respectively, and they had not entered diapause under any conditions. It takes 2 weeks for half of the females to mature eggs even at 25℃. Field researches were also made in 3 habitats of P. sita in the Kii Peninsula. Esuzaki (alt. about 20m), on the south coast facing the Pacific Ocean, was used mainly by the overwintering generation and few individuals were seen between spring and autumn. At Yamada (alt. about 360m), at the southern foot of the Izumi Range, individuals of immature stages were seen on the evergreen milkweed, Marsdenia tomentosa (Asclepiadaceae). At the study site of Mt Wasamata (alt. 1,100m), on the eastern slope of the mountain, lots of adults were seen from July to August and a few eggs and larvae were also seen on the deciduous milkweed Cynanchum caudatum (Asclepiadaceae), in the summer season. The number of generations of the 3 habitats estimated from effective accumulative temperatures of each habitat could not explain the actual occurrence of each habitat. This may be because of the high migratory nature of this species.

The numbers of moths and of species caught at each research site fluctuated seasonally in almost the same patterns. Noctuidae moths represented almost the same proportion throughout the year. Geometridae moths decreased, but those of the Pyralidae increased in proportion during summer. The patterns of seasonal fluctuation of the moth populations appear to be common throughout the mountain parts of Yamaguchi.

Four species are recognized from Japan: Adela reaumurella (Linnaeus, 1758), A. luteocilis sp. nov., A. luminaris sp. nov. and A. praepilosa sp. nov. Although A. nobilis Christoph, 1882 has been believed to be distributed in Japan, it is found that most Japanese representatives formerly known as A. nobilis belong to a distinct species, which is described here as A. praepilosa sp. nov. Differences of sexual dimorphism, such as eye size and antennal length, seen among the males of closely related species, are inferred to be independently acquired in each species probably relating to their precopulatory behavior.

N2  - Butterfly communities were monitored at 8 points in Southern Primorye, Russia, from July to August in 1995. The number of individuals and species were surveyed by route census method at 4 points. As a result, the butterfly communities in Southern Primorye were similar to those in central Japan at an elevation of about 1,500m a.s.l. So the species diversity in Southern Primorye was compared with those (Tashita and Ichimura, 1997) in Kamikochi (1,500m a.s.l.) and lower region of Okumatashiro valley (1,650m a.s.l.) in Azumi village, Nagano, central Japan, where plentiful nature with a primeval forest is protected as the national park. The species diversity in Southern Primorye was very high-from 3.46 to 4.39 in the average diversity (Shannon's H') (2.00 to 3.21 from July to August in Kamikochi and Okumatashiro valley), from 0.78 to 0.87 in the relative diversity (Pielou's J') (0.56 to 0.82 in Kamikochi and Okumatashiro valley). But the number of individuals in Southern Primorye was nearly the same as in Kamikochi and Okumatashiro valley, except that in Beresovyi stream surrounded by a primeval forest. Value of HI-index (Tashita and Ichimura, 1997) used to evaluate the natural environment of 8 points was lowest in the city of Vladivostok. But this level was the same as that in Saigawa riverside (Tashita and Ichimura, 1997) in Matsumoto, a habitat of Tongeia fischeri, Lycaeides argyrognomon and so on, and Higashifujigoko road (Sakuratani and Fujiyama, 1991) across the foot of Mt Fuji, a habitat of Leptidea amurensis, Maculinea teleius and so on, where good environment still remains. The species diversity in the environments where slight human action occurred (such as the lower reach of Losovy Range with yearly burn and Anishimovka along the railway and road) and HI values were slightly low, was higher than the primeval forest like Beresovyi stream where HI value was high, because many grassland species inhabit the moderately cultivated environments.

N2  - The taxonomy of an exotic thyridid species, Herimba atkinsoni Moore is revised. Three new subspecies are described from Taiwan and China (Zhejiang Prov., Tienmushan and Gansu Prov., Xiahe). The biological information of the Taiwanese subspecies is reported for the first time. In addition, based on genitalic features, the genus Herimba is confined to the type species, H. atkinsoni, by excluding the Herimba-trachiaria group from the genus. The genus is here allocated into Striglininae but the phylogenetic relationships with other genera are still uncertain.

N2  - As a result of a study in the field, it has been learned that the average size of adult Luehdorfia puziloi inexpecta population has no correlation with that of the preceding year. Rather, it is closely related to the number of the successful 2nd instar larvae in the preceding year. The study shows that the environmental factors, especially temperature to which larvae have been exposed from egg to the successful 2nd instar larva, largely affect the population size of adult insects in the following year.

N2  - The population interaction between aphidophagous butterfly, Taraka hamada and its larval food aphid, Ceratovacuna japonica was studied in the field. The numbers of the butterflies and aphids drastically changed every year. The aphid colonies increased from March and reached a maximum from late June to early July. The butterflies increased following the growth of aphid colonies and attained to a maximum number in early August. Aphid colonies decreased abruptly through July to August due to the intensive predation by the butterfly larvae. Thus, the butterfly larvae were faced with the food shortage, and consequently butterflies also decreased rapidly. The butterfly larvae entered overwintering diapause in late September, and stopped feeding on aphids. The characteristics of life histories of the butterfly and aphid were important for the maintenance of the predation-prey system between them.

N2  - Given are the results of observations for adult behavior, life cycle and natural enemies of Nymphalis xanthomelas japonica (Stichel) based on the 26-year field surveys chiefly made in Nagano Prefecture. The newly emerged adults seem to become either residents near habitats or migrants to the high altitude mountains. Residents seem usually to pass the mid-summer inactively in the suitable spaces. Migrants seem to return to the low to middle altitude places for hibernation, since the hibernated adults were not observed in the high mountains. A copulating pair was found in the end of March, and the flight manner in copula was confirmed as "←♀+♂" for the first time in Japan. Ovipositions were observed in April in low to middle altitude places to willows, elms and nettle trees. The larvae grow toward the end of May to June, and the adults emerged from June to the middle of July. The larvae were observed to be attacked by ten or more sparrows and two larvae were bitten by spiders. In one case, the parasitic flies escaped from 39 out of 53 pupae produced from the larvae in the field.

N2  - Larvae of Apatura metis hibernating in Hokkaido froze at -32℃ spontaneously, while they were frozen at -7℃ when ice-inoculated. Although the frozen larvae tolerated down to -19℃ for 24hrs, yet they avoided inoculative freezing by two ways: 1) to prevent water invasion onto ventral integument, through which ice-inoculation occurred, by lateral hairs and silken mat, 2) to choose hibernating site on east-northern surface of host tree trunk, where inoculation should hardly occur. The larvae accumulated glycerol in haemolymph to the amount of 6.5% of fresh body weight, together with 0.5% trehalose. For comparison, cold resistance in larvae of Sasakia charonda hibernating in litter layer was also studied. They showed no inoculation avoidance despite relatively weak ability of freezing resistance, and contained trehalose (1.4%) but no glycerol.

N2  - Geographical variation of Neozephyrus japonicus (Murray, 1875) was analyzed in egg size, the morphology of the other stages, and time of egg hatch and adult emergence for about 20 populations from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The stable differences in size and coloration of each stage and in life history were observed between the populations north of central Hokkaido and those southwest of the Kanto district, but these show a continuous cline from southern Hokkaido to southern area of the Tohoku district. Since the individuals inhabiting high elevations of central Honshu were not different from those distributed in lowlands southwest of the Kanto district, this cline was not caused by climatic environment. It is satisfactory to consider that the cline was formed by encounter of two genetically different populations, which show two different invasion routes to the Japan Islands, respectively. One is the route from Siberia to Hokkaido via the northern land bridge of the Japan Sea, and the other is from the Korean Peninsula to Kyushu and Honshu via the southern land bridge of the Japan Sea in the glacier period.

N2  - The formation of the germ disk and embryonic membranes and changes in the shape of the developing embryo of a monotrysian heteroneuran moth, Stigmella castanopsiella, were described for evaluating the systematic position of the family Nepticulidae within the Lepidoptera from the embryological standpoint. The mode of the embryonic development of this species, as a whole, was very similar to that of higher ditrysian species, but differed from that of primitive homoneuran species. In particular, the amnion and serosa of S. castanopsiella were suggested to be formed in the same fault-typed manner as that of ditrysian species, and the embryo of this species developed under the immersed condition in the yolk as commonly observed in ditrysian eggs. These embryonic characters are considered as apomorphic ones shared by the Nepticulidae and Ditrysia, and consequently these embryological findings added further weight to the view that the Heteroneura are monophyletic.

N2  - Flight activities of Colias erate were studied at high and low altitudes in Nagano Prefecture in summer from the viewpoint of body temperature of flying butterflies and environmental factors. Their flight activities were depressed by low body temperature at a high altitude and by high body one at a low altitude. At a high altitude the body temperature of flying butterflies ranged from 25 to 30℃ when it was fine and many butterflies flew at the range in which the limited environmental factors happened many times in the suitable condition for flight because the climate changed so rapidly that the suitable condition for flight was not stable. At a low altitude the flight activities of butterflies peaked twice in the morning and afternoon. On the other hand light intensity showed a unimodal peak at 13:00 (or 14:00) and from 12:00 to 14:00 the flight activities tended to have negative correlation to the light intensity. When the light intensity was high, butterflies could not fly because high radiant heat might raise the body temperature above the upper limit for flight. Consequently the different types of daily flight activities in Colias erate appeared according to the different environmental conditions between high and low altitudes at the same season; undecided type at a high altitude and bimodal type at a low one.

N2  - A local adult population of the nymphalid butterfly, Brenthis daphne rabdia (Butler), was studied by the mark-release-recapture method in a grassland at the foot of Mt Kayagatake in central Japan, in June and July, 1985. The number of adults captured and marked during the study period was 36 for males and 22 for females. The average number of recaptures among each research day in all recaptured adults was l for males and 1.6 for females. The rate of recapture throughout the study period was 11.1% and 45.5% for males and females, respectively. The maximum longevity observed was 21 days for males and 19 days for females. The present results suggest that dispersibility was higher in males than in females, while females showed a tendency to be sedentary. The causes of the differences in the mobility and dispersal patterns between males and females are discussed in the light of the distribution patterns of larval hostplants and adult nectar plants, and the emergence site of females.

The populations reared at 20℃ and 25℃ had eight larval instars, while those 30℃ and 35℃ had seven. Temperatures experienced in the first instar were critical and resulted in different numbers of instars. The temperature between 25℃ and 30℃ will be critical dividing larvae in different moulting numbers. Head width within the same instar reared at different temperatures, however, showed no difference.

The shapes of the chromosomes at metaphases-I and -II are round or somewhat oval, and their outlines are even in polar view. The conjugation of the chromosomes at metaphase-I occurs in a regular fashion, showing the usual circular arrangement on the equational plane. These facts are suggestive of high chromosomal homology of their parents, revealing a systematic kinship between the two taxa of Mycalesis.

In consequence, an attempt was made to apply one and the same system to the chaetotaxy of the epicranium and the thoracic or abdominal segment. This new system is similar to Dyar's system. The homology of setae between the epicranium and the thoracic or abdominal segment was discussed. In addition, it is noted that, if the labral piece were combined with the fronto-clypeal piece, then number of tactile setae on both pieces would be nearly same to that of setae on the thorax or abdomen.

N2  - Thermoregulation of the sunny butterfly species Colias erate and the forest one Ypthima argus, was studied at the Saigawa-riverside in the lower reaches of Tanbajima-Bridge, Nagano-city, central Japan. The optimum body temperature of C. erate ranged from 35℃ to 40℃, and that of Y. argus from 30℃ to 35℃ in August. The wing base of C. erate, that was observed to expose to the direct sun rays in the lower temperature, got darker in autumn than in summer. It was not considered that C. erate can fly at high temperature around the noon in summer and at low temperature after November, since they could not maintain their body temperature within optimum range. On the other hand, Y. argus entered the forest frequently when the solar radiation increased around the noon in summer, though flowers for nectaring and host plants for oviposition existed in the sunny place, and Y. argus basked in the perpendicular rays as the dorsal basking near the lower limit of optimum body temperature.

N2  - Caterpillars of Curetis bulls and C. santana in Peninsular Malaysia feed on the youngest leaves of various woody Fabaceae, preferably at open, sunny sites. Larval development takes 9-13 days, the pupal phase lasts 10-12 days. Larvae are not tended by ants, but are able to co-exist with certain ant genera. No dorsal nectar organ is present. The conspicuous tentacle organs are defensive organs. They appear to dissipate a secretion produced in the inner wall of the tentacle sheaths. The pupae possess unique setae inserted into deep circular cavities in the cuticle. The homology between two of these setal types and the pore cupola organs otherwise found in Lycaenidae immatures is suggested. Larvae and pupae produce substrate-borne vibrational calls of unknown function, especially after tactile disturbance. Pupae also make air-borne chirping noise with their stridulatory organ. The observations indicate that Curetis immatures are myrmecoxenous, and highlight the isolated systematic position of the genus with its numerous autapomorphies.

N2  - Seasonal polyphenism of Eurema blanda arsakia (Fruhstorfer, [1910]) was investigated in the field and the laboratory experiments. This species shows seasonal changes in wing pattern (summer and autumn morphs) in Japan. At 20℃ the autumn morph is produced under a short-day photoperiod (12L-12D) and the summer morph under a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D). The degree of the change in the wing pattern was larger in the female than in the male, and larger on the underside of the forewing than on its upperside. At 25℃ little difference was found in the pattern between these two photoperiods. The results suggest that temperature and photoperiod are responsible for the seasonal morph determination in E. blanda. These also can account for seasonal changes in the wing morphs in the field, where summer morphs are abundant in June and autumn ones abundant in November.

N2  - Oviposition characteristics and other reproductive aspects of Eurema blanda were compared with E. hecaba. Although these two species are closely related, the reproductive particularities were different from each other. In the field, E. blanda eggs were found in clusters consisting of 25 to 85 eggs, while E. hecabe eggs were found singly on host plants. The dissection of wild females showed that E. blanda were carrying much more eggs than E. hecabe. Laboratory experiments showed that E. blanda deposited much more eggs per female and per oviposition-day than E. hecabe and that oviposition-day interval was longer in E. blanda than in E. hecabe. Video-tape analyses confirmed that E. blanda females consecutively continued to lay eggs in clusters without intervening flights. The dissection of virgin females also showed that the ovarian maturation was different between the two species : the production of mature eggs in ovaries occurred more slowly but the eggs were much more in E. blanda than in E. hecabe.

N2  - To know the determinants of adult wing forms, f. crocale and f. pomona, and larval and pupal coloration of the Sabahan population of the Lemon Migrant, Catopsilia pomona, the larvae were reared in isolation or in crowds under a short (10-hour) photoperiod or natural photoperiods (about 13-hour) at room temperatures (22-34℃). The larval photoperiod affected the adult forms : several intermediate forms emerged under the short day, while all the individuals were of f. crocale under natural photoperiods. A phase variation was observed in the larval stage : conspicuous black lateral stripes appeared in the larvae reared in crowds, while the larval body was almost green in the solitary rearing. The high density also caused the slight shortening of larval stage and the decrease in pupal size. The pupal coloration was proved to be determined by the ground color of substratum for pupation : yellowish green and brown backgrounds induced greenish and brownish pupae, respectively.

N2  - A redescription of the holotype male of Japonica lutea onoi Murayama, 1953 is given not only for the external features but for the genitalia. The genitalia of the holotype are completely identical with those of the taxon from northern Japan which is exclusively associated with Quercus dentata, characterized by brownish spots encircling the 2nd to 6th abdominal spiracles in the later instar larvae, and recently separated from lutea as a good species with a restored name onoi based on external features (Inomata, 1990). Therefore, the current identification of onoi is completely verified. J. onoi is a species distinctly separable from related species, lutea, adusta and patungkoanui based on the morphology of the male genitalia.

N2  - We revise the classification of taxa belonging to the genus Maculinea from the East Palaearctic Region. In this region, in addition to the well-known three species: M. arion (Linnaeus, 1758), M. arionides (Staudinger, 1887) and M. teleius (Bergstrasser, [1779] 1778-1780), two additional species occur: M. alcon ([Denis & Schiffermuller], 1775) (upper and middle Amur River, Primor'e, China Northeast/Manchuria and North Korea) and M. kurentzovi sp. nov. (upper and middle Amur River, Primor'e, China Northeast and North Korea). Lycaena kondakovi (Kurentzov, 1970) described from Primor'e is a composite species : the lectotype ♂ designated here represents an East-Asian subspecies of M. alcon, but its single paralectotype is a ♀ to be assigned to M. kurentzovi sp. nov. Only limited numbers of specimens have been known with M. alcon kondakovi from lowlands of "Far-Eastern" Russia and China Northeast, but in North Korea we found a conspicuous allied taxon arirang nov. (♀ unknown), which we treat here as a highland subspecies of M. alcon but which may actually represent a good species. Of kurentzovi, we have found a series of specimens which have so far been mostly confused with M. teleius in various collections. We treat Glaucopsyche xiaheana Murayama, 1991 from western Gansu as a subspecies of M. arion along with other subspecies from the central and western parts of China : M. arion philidor (Fruhstorfer, 1915) from the east end of the Qilian Range as well as Mongolia, the type locality, and M. arion inferna nom. nov., a replacement name for Lycaena tatsienluica (Oberthur, 1910) (praeoccupied) from Tibet, Sichuan and Qinghai. Because of the similarity of male genitalia and existence of intermediate forms, we regard M. sinalcon Murayama, 1992 described from Qinghai as a subspecies of M. teleius despite a few significant characteristics of the holotype. East continental Asia may be regarded as the headquarter of the genus Maculinea.

N2  - Forty-five Agrias narcissus tapajonus Fassl butterflies from Santarem, Brazil were classified according to their anterior red band extensions. The percentage of insects with red bands descending below vein 2 was significantly different between 22 males and 23 females (59% vs 26%, p<0.05). The frequency of subapical blue patches was also significantly different between males and females (82% vs 30%, p<0.005), and bore no relationship to their red band extensions. These findings suggest that Agrias narcissus tapajonus butterflies from Santarem have wide red band variations that are closely related to sex.

N2  - Seven new species and one new subspecies of clear-wing moths from Japan and China are described. Synanthedon esperi sp. n. from Okinawa is somewhat similar to S. quercus (Mats.), but it differs from it in the completely yellow ventral part of the abdomen. The host plant is unknown. S. multitarsus sp. n. was reared from Salix sp. and Alnus sp. in Hokkaido and Honshu. It is similar to S. flaviventre (Stgr.) and S. martjanovi Shelj., but it differs from these species in swollen hind metatarsus in males. S. pseudoscoliaeforme sp. n. is described according to a single specimen from Kyoto. It is similar to S. scoliaeforme (Bkh.) in wing pattern (large, rounded discal spot of forewing), but it differs substantially from this species in the coloring of legs and abdomen. The host plant is unknown. S. yanoi sp. n. is somewhat similar to the European S. andrenaeforme (Lasp.) and to S. ulmicolum Yang & Wang, but it differs in structure of the male genitalia and in habitual details. It is known only from a few specimens from Hokkaido and Kyushu; host plant unknown. S. fukuzumii sp. n. is known from two specimens from Honshu and Kyushu, and the host plant is unknown. It is similar to S. uralense Bart., S. spatenkai Gorbunov and S. armeniacum Gorbunov. Sesia solitera sp. n., from high mountains in China, is known from a single specimen only. It is very characteristic and not similar to other Sesia species. Similipepsis yunnanensis sp. n. from high altitudes in North Yunnan (China) is known from two specimens. It is the second palearctic species of this genus and it is clearly different from all known Similipepsis species. Synanthedon scoliaeforme japonicum ssp. n. is known from a few specimens from Hokkaido and Honshu. It differs from typical 5. scoliaeforme scoliaeforme (Bkh.) in having a black anal tuft, yellowish smoked wing, and other differences.

N2  - During a collecting trip in Primor'e (Primorye), I made observations on the daily flying period of males, mostly exhibiting territorial activities, in several species of the genus Favonius. The results largely coincided with what is known of the genus Favonius in Japan, confirming the species-specific nature of the flying period in this genus. Males tentatively identified as F. korshunovi, endemic to Primor'e, actively flew in the afternoon between 16-19 h local time, which corresponded to 14-17 h Japanese time in the same longitude zone. There was an indication that a putative Favonius species flew actively in the early morning (07-08 h in Japanese time). I noticed no overlapping of the territorially active flying periods between different Favonius species at any localities, except, as in Japan, for F. ultramarinus and F. saphirinus which flew near their host plants of Quercus dentata in the evening, but which showed only a weak territoriality, if any. Overlap in active time between different species may occur with species which are not found at the same locality. I also analyse the back-ground counts of all the other butterflies at the observation spot selected for Favonius, in the context of biodiversity in Primor'e in comparison with the diminishing biodiversity in Japan.

N2  - Hilltopping behaviour of the Indian Awlking, Choaspes benjaminii japonica (MURRAY), was observed around the top of Mt. Kazura in Nagano. The circularflight of males is possibly mate-searching behaviour. Flying males spaced out the circular flight areas with each other. However, the area was not a territory because no territorial defence was observed. I suggest "continuously flying type" mate-locating strategy of the Indian Awlking is advantageous for catching females which flutter very fast.

The sequence of courtship, the evidence of a recopulation of a female, and copulating pairs' behavior were described. A mating plug was detached from a female's abdomen due to the forced copulatory attempt by a male in two cases, and in one case, it ended in copulation which lasted for more than 190min. A mating plug was not deposited in this case of recopulation.

The haploid chromosome number of Atrophaneura horishana, a papilionid endemic to Formosa, was 30 and an n, 48-karyotype comprizing a single element of large size was established for Parantica sita niphonica. Supplementary observations of primary spermatocyte chromosomes were made in Byasa polyeuctes termessus and Papilio protenor amaura and those of secondary spermatocyte chromosomes in Polytremis lubricans taiwana. Their metaphase configurations were shown. The occurrence of variation in the number of haploid chromosomes was confirmed in Ideopsis similis similis from two geographically remote localities.

Both sexes of artificial hybrids were sterile and both sexes of natural hybrids were the same. The copulation between P. hoenei ♀ × P. glacialis ♂ was impossible because of incorrespondence of genitalia. The fact suggests that the natural hybrids in the sympatric habitats are only F_1 of P. glacialis ♀ × P. hoenei ♂.

N2  - Adult males of the Papilio bianor complex were collected in Taiwn, Ishigaki island, the main island of Okinawa, and Hyogo. The samples represent members of certain subspecies of this species complex. Cell-free extracts of isolated testes and other arrayed tissues were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After reading of the separated bands, the proportion of non-common bands out of the total was calculated and expressed by a dissimilarity index (DI). The average DI value within the populations was 0.017. On the other hand, that among localities was 0.153. The given DI values were 0.212 between Taiwan and Ishigaki, 0.148 between Taiwan and Okinawa, 0.128 between Taiwan and Hyogo, 0.160 between Ishigaki and Okinawa, 0.116 between Ishigaki and Hyogo, and 0.155 between Okinawa and Hyogo. Papilio maackii is closely related to P. bianor complex, but it is a distinct species. When we take P. maackii as a control, the DI values between this species and each of the local populations of P. bianor complex were 0.145, 0.128, 0.102, and 0.178 for Taiwan, Ishigaki, Okinawa, and Hyogo, respectively. These values were almost equal to or rather smaller than the average value of 0.153 within the above localities of P. bianor complex. These results strongly support our previous findings that genetic divergence between local populations of P. bianor complex is on species level (KOMINAMI et al., 1987). Speciation is in progress in P. bianor complex, especially in island populations.

N2  - Dry matter budget of the larvae of Taraka hamada was studied, and food utilization efficiencies were compared between the groups reared under surplus and limited food conditions. The influence of food supply on the larval growth pattern under several food conditions was also studied. The larva of surplus food condition fed on aphids of 21-44 mg in dry weight during the 4th instar. The amount is equal to 6-13 small aphid colonies which are usually observed in the field. The larvae could pupate even under limited food condition, though they had been fed on a third of the surplus amount. The conversion efficiency of ingested foods to body substances of T. hamada (27.4-44.4%) was higher in comparison with those of phytophagous lepidopterans. Furthermore, T. hamada larvae utilized the food with higher efficiency when it was limited. Under food shortage, larvae tended to pupate when they reached the minimal weight for pupation. Delay of pupation was only one or two days even when they were reared on limited food.

N2  - Surveys and observations on the overwintering colonies of Euploea butterflies were made in southern Taiwan in the winters of 1978 and 1979 to 1980. The overwintering sites were located in the valleys at the western foot of the Taiwan Central Range at altitudes between 100 and 800 m. Overwintering colonies, which mainly consist of four species of Euploea butterflies; E. Sylvester, E. tulliolus, E. mulciber and E. leucostictos, were found forming in natural forests, or in the plantation of teak (Tectona grandis) or Acacia confusa. Females sampled in late December had no mature eggs in the ovaries, which shows that Euploea butterflies pass the winter in the state of reproductive diapause.

N2  - Nacaduba normani, a small Lycaenid butterfly rather recently described from Borneo, belongs to the berenice group of the genus. The larvae of this species were found to feed on young leaves of cocoa tree, Theobroma cacao. The stubborn infestation by the larvae was caused by the presence of the original host plant, Paranephelium nitidum retained as a shade tree of the cocoa plantation. Eggs hatched 2 days after oviposition. The larval stages lasted 7 to 8 days. Very small ants were in association with the larvae. The pupal stage lasted 6 days. The emergence of adults took place between 0900 and 1000 hrs.

Nineteen species of the larvae of the Leucania-complex, are studied and compared with other noctuid species. The peculiar reduction in the mandibular teeth of mature larvae seen in the Leucania-complex is hypothesized to be an autoapomorphic character.

Cladistic analysis has placed Tiradelphe in an unresolved group with Danaus and Tirumala. Discovery of the unknown male of Tiradelphe is therefore expected to shed new light on the evolution of these butterflies, including their chemical communication.

N2  - Adults of the South-East Asian lycaenid butterfly Allotinus unicolor search for trophobiotic homopterans associated with a particular ant species, Ano-plolepis longipes. The butterflies settle down for feeding in such associations after a characteristic pre-alighting ("examination flight") and appeasement ("proboscis palpation") behaviour. Preimaginal instars of A. unicolor were always related with the same ant species as well. A. unicolor uses a wide range of homopterans for oviposition. The orientation mechanisms for specific ant recognition (probably visual and olfactory), the selective value of specific ant-associations for Miletinae butter-flies, the consequences of such strategies for the larval food range, and the evolution of adult myrmecophily within the genus Allotinus are discussed.

N2  - Morphology and the number of spermatocyte chromosomes were examined in males of Brenthis ino mashuensis (KoNO, 1931) from three localities of Hokkaido. As shown in the figures, the haploid chromosomes are small and round or oval in outline. Chromosome counts were first made in a total of 1903 metaphases in testis-sections of ten males from these localities ; 84 in the second division in two adults from Butokamabetsu (Horokanai-cho), 25 in the first division and 25 in the second division in two adults from ShStoshibetsu (Rikubetsu-cho), and 703 in the first division and 1066 in the second division in one larva and five pupae from Nukabira (Kamishihoro-cho). Fourteen elements (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) were observed in 1883 (ca. 99%) of these 1903 metaphases and more than fourteen elements (Figs. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) in the remaining 20 (ca. 1%) (Table 1). Further, occurrence of fourteen elements (Figs. 12 and 13) was confirmed in 311 metaphases in the first division and 208 in the second division in lacto-acetic orcein testis-squashes of two larvae, one prepupa and four pupae from Nukabira. The haploid chromosome number of this subspecies thus determined is 14, in accordance with that of another subspecies, B. i. tigroides (FRUHSTORFER, 1907), of the Main Island.

N2  - A male Tanaecia under treatment was taken by the author in September, 1963, in the upland creek of Ormoc, on Western Leyte. This area was the favorite collecting ground of the author since 1933. The area was well jungled in pre-war days. After the war the creeks were still well vegetated. At present wilderness may have encroached upon farmlands on account of the activities of communist rebels and outlaws. Although taken in the habitat of the common Tanaecia leucotaenia SEMPER, it is smallish and resembles the latter only in its colors. Its size recalls the average T. susoni JUMALON of Cebu. For comparison the author has before him 4 specimens of susoni, and of T. leucotaenia, 4 from Samar, 10 from Leyte, and 30 from Bohol. Of T. aquamarina FRUHSTORFER, 3 from Davao, Mindanao. The most distinguishing feature of this new nymphalid is its very strong underside markings which easily set it apart from all the above-mentioned forms, including the large T. howarthi JUMALON of Negros Island.

N2  - The egg size, fecundity, and larval head width of 5 polyphagous Amphipyra species, A.livida, A.monolitha, A.tripartita, A.schrenckii and A.erebina were examined. There were no relation between the egg size and the forewing length. The fecundity also showed no special relation to the forewing length. However, there was clear tendency that the egg size was changed in an inverse proportion to the fecundity. The gradient of head growth line showed a parallel change with the egg size and fecundity. The monophagous species A.subrigua, additionally reared, had a somewhat specialized head growth pattern with a lower gradient of growth line than the others. Possible implication of the results were discussed.

When the female remained motionless with her wings closed, the male did not attempt to copulate. The pair repeated the similar behavior four times, but they did not engage in copulation. The female might reject mating by remaining motionless with the wings closed.

N2  - A reappraisal of the systematic position of Libytheidae, employing both adult and immature complex morphological characters that are largely external, indicates it evolved from a Pierinae ancestor and gave rise to Nymphalinae sensu stricto. The Libytheidae combine both pierid and nymphalid characteristics and is best regarded as a separate family. The results differ somewhat from those derived by cladistics which had missed its Pierinae derivation. An evolutionary series can be traced back from Pieridae through Lycaenidae to Lymantriidae. Rhopalocera probably arose diphyletically from Noctuoidea, viz. Lymantriidae-Lipteninae (Africa) and Agaris-tidae-Euschemoninae (Queensland). The general development of Ditrysia is also traced. Stem genera (derived directly from ancestors) to various ditrysian families, identified by non-cladistic clustering by symplesiomorphy, include Psychidarbela, Pemphigostola, Ancarista, Apoprogones, Euschemon, Lamproptera, Larinopoda, and Libytheana. The resultant evolution of Rhopaloceran families obeys Cope's Rule. Inferences drawn from plate tectonics and associated non-Lepidopteran fossils indi-cate that strategic origin times were the mid-Oxfordian (Agaristidae), Albian (Eus-chemoninae), and Cenomanian (Lycaenidae).

N2  - In relation to the secondary succession of a pine forest after clear-cutting, changes in the number of the maculatus skipper, Pyrgus maculatus BREMER & GREY was surveyed from April, 1985 to July, 1988 in the Kisodani Valley, central Japan. The number of eggs found in this site was rapidly reduced according to the growth of Chamaecyparis obtusa ENDL., chiefly because mother butterflies hardly laid their eggs when the host plant was covered largely by other plant species. There was a tendency for the females to choose lonely host plants growing on the lands barren of other plants. This means that the skipper is mainly associated with the early stage of succession. Recently, the suitable habitat for the skipper, such as area of deforestation and domestic animal-breeding grassland, has been decreasing. I suppose this is one of the main reasons why this skipper has been less common.

N2  - 1. New localities are added to the distribution map of Neope niphonica kiyosumiensis TAKAHASHI et AOYAMA in the Boso Peninsula, which was showed in the first report (TAKAHASHI and AOYAMA, 1981). 2. Adults of the spring and the summer form emerge earlier and later respectively than those of the nominate subspecies niphonica. Delay of adult emergence in the summer generation probably occurs as a result of the pupal diapause in the summer. 3. The present subspecies is distributed in cooler areas of the Boso Peninsula. The distribution is possibly limited by rather high temperature during the summer. 4. This subspecies occurs in deciduous broad leaved forests with the shrubbery of Pleioblastus, Bambusaceae, at the foot of mountain, on the hill side, at the river side, etc. 5. Pleioblastus chino, Bambusaceae, is the most common larval food plant. Eggs and larvae were found on the underside of the leave. 6. Adults suck the sap of the deciduous broad leaved trees, mainly Quercus acutissima and Q. serrata. Scarecely, they are seen drinking the water on the ground. 7. The spring form adults fly all the day. Some males behave territorially around the tip of branch or the tree trunk, while others continue to fly up and down around the tree trunk. Those males probably search for mates. The summer form adults fly actively in the evening, but they stay on the leaves of under-growth from late morning to early afternoon. The males fly similarly to those of the spring form, though the flight is slower and the up-down flight is less conspicuous. 8. Females lay eggs in batches with several to more than twenty eggs. 9. We speculate that Neope niphonica kiyosumienses might be differentiated from the nominate subspecies during the Riss-Wurm inter-glacial period in the Pleistocene.

N2  - I had an opportunity of seeing the butterfly collections preserved in Museum fur Naturkunde der Humboldt-Universitat, Berlin (MNHU) and Staatliches Museum fur Tierkunde, Dresden (SMT), and I examined some type specimens of South-east Asian Lycaenidae, mainly described by O. STAUDINGER, J. ROBER and C. RIBBE. Of STAUDIN-GER'S collection preserved in MNHU, many of the specimens were present in good condition, but some of them were damaged or destroyed during the War, especially part of the genus Arhopala, as already mentioned by EVANS (1957). In this paper, I list the type specimens examined in MNHU and SMT, with designation of lectotypes, except for the Lycaenopsis group which was dealt with by ELIOT & KAWAZOE (1983). When I could not determine from the original description that a taxon was established on a single specimen, I made it a rule to designate a lectotype. The labels bearing the lectotypes are described. The / mark separates data on individual labels, and my notations are in square brackets or round brackets with the abbreviations (h)=handwritten and (p)=printed. Then I deal with some new knowledge of these identifications, with several nomenclatural modifications as a result of external examination of the type specimens. The present list lacks some unconfirmed type specimens which should be preserved in these Museums, so I intend to publish a further list in the future.

N2  - 1. Morphological characters of immature stages of Ypthima praenubilia kanonis MATSUMURA in nothern Taiwan were described with some ecological notes. 2. Egg: Pale green, nearly spherical in shape, rather swollen in lower hemisphere. 1.1 mm in diameter and 1.1 mm in height. 3. Larvae: Pale brown in ground colour, cylindrical in shape with a pair of tail projections; a pair of processes on head; final (7th) instar larva grown to 37 - 39 mm in length. Prominent characters of each instar larva are as follows: 1st instar: Thorax and abdomen greenish, with reddish brown longitudinal lines; head with rounded processes; apices of abdominal setae spherical. 2nd instar: Head with a pair of pointed dorsal processes; abdomen with pale yellow band in subdorsal area. 3rd instar: 4th abdominal segment with a dark brown patch on subdorsal area. 4th instar: 1st to 6th abdominal segments with subdorsal dark brown patches, prothorax and 8th abdominal segment each with conspicuous black band. 5th instar: Dark brown patches on 1st to 6th segments composed of a complicated dorsal pattern. 6th instar: Each abdominal segment bearing a longitudinal wave-shaped yellow-brown band on subdorsal area, the band including a dark patch. 7th (final) instar: A pair of dark brown patches on each abdominal segment connected to each other in several segments; dorsal area of 4th abdominal segment reddish brown; posterior part of abdomen greyish; thoracic legs and prolegs dark brown; in subvental area, a dark brown band with the same coloured line internally. 4. Pupa: Dark brown dorsally and pale brown ventrally; 4th abdominal segment with a dorsal bow-shaped ridge, and 5th - 9th abdominal segments with paler straight ridges. 20 mm in length. 5. This butterfly is univoltine and appears from June to July in the mountainous area of northern Taiwan, 500 - 1000 m in altitude. 6. Some eggs were found on the undersides of young leaves of Miscanthus sinensis ANDERS. subsp. formosanus HACK., which is probably the main food plant of this butterfly in northern Taiwan. 7. Adult sips tree juice, sometimes sucks water on the ground and visits flowers with lazy flight.

N2  - The adult dispersal in the aphidphagous lycaenid, Taraka hamada was studied by using the marking method. The results demonstrated that the butterflies dispersed to search new habitats. The butterflies seemed to move along the forest edge, where the larval food, the aphid, Ceratovacuna japonica, usually occurred. Eight females and two males were observed to immigrate into new places. The adult dispersal should be an important strategy for T. hamada to maintain the population, because this species depends on the unstable food resource.

Through the courtesy of Dr. H. INOUE, Otsuma Women's University, Iruma and Dr. M. OWADA, the National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo, I could examine a number of specimens of Sarcinodes from Southeast Asia and Japan. As the result of my examination, it was proved that perakaria, sumatraria and yaeyamana are three distinct species and not conspecif ic with restitutaria. Besides these species mentioned above, in this paper three species related to restitutaria, one from Thailand and two from the Philippines, will be described as new. All the type specimens designated here are presereved in the National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo, unless otherwise stated.

N2  - Through the courtesy of Mr. M. OKADA, we had an opportunity to see a photograph in colours of a sesiid moth taken by him in the island of Amami-Ohshima on the 10th of June, 1980. The transparency gave us surprise, because the species on the picture, belonging to the genus Melittia, has not been known to occur in Japan. An illustration from the photograph by him is given in Fig. 1. We made lepidopterous collection trips to the island in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987, and it was very fortunate for us that we were able to collect one male and four females of this species. This large blackish male specimen well agrees with the male holotype of Melittia formosana MATSUMURA from Taiwan in the superficial appearance as well as in the genitalia. M. formosana MATSUMURA is redescribed from specimens taken in the island of Amami-Ohshima. We wish to express our gratitude to Mr. M. OKADA, Nagoya Kontyu-kan, Nagoya, for his valuable information on this interesting species, to Dr. S. MORIUTI, University of Osaka Prefecture, for his critical advice and for his kindness in correcting the manuscript, and to Dr. T.

N2  - The life-histories of different South East Asian Miletinae (Lycaenidae) of the genera Logania, Miletus, and Allotinus are described. Larval sternorrhyncho-phagy is likely the plesiomorphic condition in this subfamily; it still occurs in Logania malayica, where the caterpillars feed on ant-attended aphids. The imagines feed on honeydew of the same species of aphids and at night rest within the ant-attended aphid colonies. In the species-rich genera Miletus and Allotinus, different food specializations are found: Miletus biggsii feeds on several species of aphids as well as coccids. In all observed cases its prey was attended by ants of the genus Dolichoderus (Dolichoderinae), which seem to be the oviposition cue for the females. In Allotinus apries the L_1 caterpillar feeds on coccids, whereas the L_2 larva is carried by ants of the myrmicine species Myrmicaria lutea into their nests and supposedly feeds as a kleptoparasite on the ant's brood. In Allotinus subviolaceus the larvae feed on membracids (Auchenorrhyncha).

N2  - The quercus hornet moth, Sesia rhynchioides (BUTLER), is a well-known pest of chestnut, Castanea crenata SIEBOLD et ZUCCARINI, in Japan (MACHIDA and MIYASHITA, 1969). This species was originally described by BUTLER (1881) from the female. The ditailed account of the biology was given by MACHIDA and MIYASHITA (1969), and the mature larva was described by HATTORI (1969) in ditail. This species shows a distinct sexual dimorphism in colouration. In the present paper we give a full description of the male, together with the genitalia, though MACHIDA and MIYASHITA (1969) briefly described the male. The male genitalia have hitherto been unknown. We wish to express deepest appreciation to Dr. S. MORIUTI, of University of Osaka Prefecture, for his kindness in correcting the manuscript.

N2  - Descoreba simplex BUTLER, a polyphagous geometrid moth, has been identified, mainly in Honshu, as feeding on 23 species of deciduous and 7 species of evergreen trees which belong to 17 plant families. On 24 June 1987, a large number of mature larvae of D. simplex were observed after infesting many species of broad-leaved evergreen trees in the Takakuma Experimental Forest of Kagoshima University. Immediately 148 trees consisting of 29 species in 20 families were surveyed at a stand of broad-leaved evergreen trees in the Experimental Forest in order to determine the percentages of trees and leaves infested and the number of larvae located on each tree. A total of 105 trees out of 148 were apparently infested by the larvae, and they were classified into 14 species belonging to 7 families. Eleven of them, including 1 deciduous and 10 broad-leaved evergreen species, were newly added to the previously known host plants of the moth. As a result, the number of host plant species amounted to 41, belonging to 19 families. The percentages of trees and leaves infested were markedly high for such evergreen trees as Pasania edulis, Illicium religiosum and some species of Lauraceae. Almost all the larvae collected from the field died in the laboratory due to an unidentified disease.

N2  - In the first part of this series of studies (BALDIZZONE and OKU, 1988), we have described four new Coleophora species from Japan. We take this occasion to add further four new species of the genus to the Japanese fauna. Judging from the fact that the valva is directly set on the sacculus in the male genitalia, these new forms may be included in the 30th species group of Coleophora defined by TOLL (1952). The type specimens will be deposited in the collections of the Entomological Institute, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan (EHU), the Smithsonian Institution, U.S. National Museum, Washington B.C., USA (USNM), and the senior author (BLDZ). We thank Drs. Donald R. DAVIS and R. W. HODGES for their kindness in provision of material from the ISSIKI collection, Smithsonian Institution.

Luzon), silmae SCHRODER et TREADAWAY, 1978 (from Leyte) and inouei OSADA et HASHIMOTO, 1982 (from Negros). Recently we captured a remarkable new geographical race of this species from Mindoro. In this present paper, we describe it as a new subspecies.

N2  - In Japan, twenty-five species of the family Coleophoridae have been recorded by ISSIKI (1950, 1957), MATSUMURA (1930), MEYRICK (1931, 1932, 1936), MORIUTI (1972, 1982), and OKU (1965, 1979). Among them, Coleophora longi signella MORIUTI is conspecific with C. obducta MEYRICK, and C. tholoneura MEYRICK with C. versurella ZELLER (BALDIZZONE, 1985). Therefore, twenty-three Japanese species are known at present. However, they may represent only a part of the Japanese coleophorid fauna. In fact, we have found many other species of the family caught in Japan in some public and private collections. The present series of our studies aims to describe the new findings concerned. At first, four new species of the genus Coleophora are described here. To denote the position of mouth opening in larval case, HERRICH-SCHAFFER'S method is employed (see HERING, 1951, p.102). The type depositories are abbreviated as follows: EHU=Entomological Institute, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan; USNM = U. S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington B.C., USA; ZMH = Zoological Museum, University of Helsinki, Finland; BLDZ=private collection of the senior author ; and PTK=private collection of Mr. H.

N2  - Comparison between Delias belisama balina FRUHSTORFER, 1908 and D. oraia bratana KALIS, 1941, both from the central Bali and its vicinities was made by some morphological and behavioural characters. These two species resemble each other, but there are definable differences between them in the habitat, habit, adult size and wing marking, as described below: 1) D. belisama balina is widely distributed in the Bali island from the foot hills to the altitudes of 1,000m or higher, whereas D. oraia bratana seems to be confined to mountainous areas at the altitude of 1,000m or higher around the central Bali (Fig. 1). 2) The both species were observed to fly together at peripheries of montane woodland 1,000m or higher, where D. oraia bratana was apparently commoner and also more active than D. belisama balina. On the other hand, the author found some individuals of D. belisama balina congregating on the twigs at sunny spots in woodland but such was not the case with D. oraia bratana (Fig. 2). 3) D. oraia bratana (the mean forewing length 37.6 mm in ♂ and 38.9 mm in ♀) was larger than D. belisama balina(36.5 mm in ♂ and 37.1 mm in ♀) in both sexes (P<0.05 by t-test, Table 1). But specimens of both species can not be distinguished from each other by the sizes only because of the existence of many individuals with identical sizes belonging to either species (Fig. 3). 4) The two species may be distinguishable from each other using characteristics pertaining to the following points; ♂: the marginal black band on the forewing upperside; the extent of suffusion with whitish scales in basal half of the forewing underside; colour tone of the yellow area, colour tone and size of the red spot on the hindwing underside. ♀: colour tone and size of the red spot, and the extent of suffusion with blackish scales on the hindwing underside (Figs. 4-7).

N2  - The genus Gonepteryx was taxonomically reviewed mainly based on the ultraviolet reflective patches generally called "the UV pattern" or "the hidden wing pattern" on the upperside of male wings. The UV reflective patches, general features, distribution and taxonomic notes were briefly described in each species and subspecies. The description of UV reflective patches was made by classifying into 5 grades in relation to the development of UV reflective patches. The UV patterns were so constant in every species (or subspecies) that it could be used as an useful character to classify the Gonepteryx species, except for some cases such as in G. rhamni rhamni or G. amintha formosana in which the pattern was individually fairly various. In most localities where 2 to 4 species occur sympatrically, these patterns were specifically different in the grades. This fact suggests that the UV patterns had been characteristically developed in each species so as to play an important role not only in intra-specific sexual communication, but also in behavioural isolating mechanism.

N2  - Since my previous papers on the genus Epipsestis (YOSHIMOTO, 1982, 1984), some new knowledges on this genus have been accumulated at my hand. This paper presents the descriptions of a subspecies of E. ornata (LEECH) from Primorye of USSR and a color variation of E. longipennis YOSHIMOTO from N. India, a new name for Polyploca nigropunctata SICK, 1941 (nee WARREN, 1915), and a new combination for Polyploca castaneata WARREN, 1915, with some supplementary records and notes.

N2  - Sesia molybdoceps (HAMPSON) is known to feed on Quercus sessiliforia BLUME(Fagaceae) in Japan (WATANABE, 1967). The larvae were found in Aichi-ken in 1983, 1985 and 1986, feeding on three fagaceous plants, Castanea crenata SlEBOLD et ZUCCAR-INI, Quercus acutissima CARRUTHERS and Q. serrata THUNBERG, and they developed into adults. The larva bores under the bark and makes irregular tunnels or rather small hole between bark and wood from ground level to near one meter high of host-plant. The larva is soaking wet in sap, and the frass and sap are extruded or oozed from larval tunnel through bark during summer season. Beetles and wasps come to the ooze on the surface of trunk in swarms. Pupation takes place in cocoon very close to or in the larval tunnel in August.

N2  - Chaeopsestis ludovicae LE CERF, 1941, is a very rare thyatirid moth described from North Vietnam, Tonkin, Chapa, as a new genus and a new species, and there has been appeared no subsequent record in literature since its original description. When I cited this genus in my previous paper on the genus Neotogaria MATSUMURA, 1933 (YOSHIMOTO, 1984), it was merely based upon the examination of the photographs of moth and male genitalia of the type specimens preserved in Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. Through the courtesies of Dr. S. MORIUTI, University of Osaka Prefecture, and Mr. S. SUGI, Tokyo, I could have a good opportunity to examine a rich material of this rare moth brought from North Thailand by the Japanese Expedition to Thailand 1985, organized by University of Osaka Prefecture. In this short note, I first record this species from North Thailand and describe the male and female genitalic structure.

N2  - Morphological characters of Neope niphonica kiyosumiensis TAKAHASHI et AOYAMA(Lepidoptera: Satyridae) from Boso Peninsula, Chiba-ken (Prefecture), Central Japan, were compared with those of N. n. niphonica BUTLER from the prefectures of Shizuoka, Yamanashi and Kagoshima. Egg of the subspecies kiyosumiensis is smaller in diameter than that of the subspecies niphonica. Head width of the 1st inster larva of kiyosumiensis is also smaller than that of niphonica and a dark brown lateral band around the head is recognized in many individuals of the 1st instar larva. Along the dorsal line of the 2nd-4th instar larvae of kiyosumiensis, a row of prominent dark brown patches is found in many individuals. This characteristic is unknown in other subspecies of this butterfly. The pupa of kiyosumiensis is smaller and lighter than that of niphonica and has less dark patches.

N2  - In order to study the interspecific relationship between Parnassius glacialis and P.hoenei, the authors carried out hybridizing experiments between P. glacialis ♀ and P. hoenei ♂ by hand-pairing and field surveys in search of natural hybrids in some localities where these species concur together. The F_1 hybrids obtained experimentally developed normally into the adult stage, producing large specimens of both sexes. The morphology of the larva, pupa or adult of F_1, including that of the external genitalia, revealed precisely intermediate features. Wild specimens comparable to the F1 adults collected in some localities in Western Hokkaido accounted for 6 to 22 percent of the total population. These adults are considered to be interspecific hybrids because of their similarity to the experimentally raised F_1 hybrids. A wild last instar larva collected in one of these habitats, and its pupal and adult stage were similar to those of the experimentally obtained F_l. As a result, it is presumed that natural interspecific matings occuring frequently in these localities.

N2  - A total of 163 adult males of P. bianor complex were collected in 1986 at three localities on the mainland of Japan, on the main island of Okinawa, and on Ishigaki Island. The butterflies collected from these localities are classified taxonomically into separate subspecies and make up a P. bianor complex. Fluid extract of the individual male was analyzed with gel-electrophoresis at six isozyme loci. The gene flow and genetic distances between these populations were examined using the resultant allelic frequencies. Specific alleles were fixed independently, both in the alcohol dehydrogenase locus and in the acid phosphatase locus between the three populations. There was no indication of geneflow between the populations. The remaining four isozyme loci depicted similar patterns of divergence, but with less prominence. Genetic distances, calculated by the formula of NEI (1972), were 0.896 between populations on the mainland of Japan and on the main island of Okinawa, 0.737 between populations on the mainland of Japan and on Ishigaki Island, and 1.268 between populations on the main island of Okinawa and on Ishigaki Island, respectively. The magnitudes of these distances strongly suggest that the divergence observed in the island populations of P. bianor complex is significantly greater than that of interpopulationals within a single species. Allopatric speciation is in progress with the aid of random fixation of genes due to the limited number of individuals in island populations of P. bianor complex.

N2  - Matsumuraeses capax RAZOWSKI et YASUDA which was taken in the subalpine gravel zone (alt. 2400 m) of Mt. Fuji is new to the Japanese tortricid-fauna. The mature larva of this species was found in the pod of Astragalus membranaceus BUNGE in the early of September and emerged in October but a part of them hibernated in the pupal stage.

N2  - In this paper, the subspecific characteristics of the eggs, larvae and adults of lunar moths, Actias gnoma (BUTLER) and A. artemis(BREMER et GREY), are described. Results of inter-subspecific crossing of the moths and discussion on the zoogeography of the two species are also given. 1. In adults, A. gnoma mandschurica from Hokkaido and A. gnoma gnoma from Honshu are similar but A. gnoma miyatai from the Izu islands is definitely different from them. The latter has smaller body and fore-wing with small eye-spot and soft curved apex than the former two. The adults of two subspecies of A. artemis, A. a. artemis from Hokkaido and A. a. aliena from Honshu, show no detectable differences in the morphological characters. The male of subsp. artemis has blue wings instead of yellow ones found in A. a. aliena. While, the non-diapausing pupae of A. a. artemis, reared at high temperature (25℃) and long-day conditions, yield yellowish males which are similar to the summer form of subsp. aliena. 2. There are obvious differences in the coloration among the 1st inster larvae of Actias subspecies. The head, prothoracic shield, setae and body surface are black in A. gnoma mandschurica and A. artemis artemis from Hokkaido blackish-brown in A. gnoma gnoma, yellowish-brown in A. artemis aliena from Honshu and pale reddish-yellow (Hachijo-jima) or reddish-brown (Kozu-shima and Miyake-jima) in A. gnoma miyatai from the Izu Islands. The variation of the larval coloration can be regard as adaptation to temperature in their habitats. 3. The male genitalic structure of A. g. miyatai is different from the other subspecies. In the former, the uncus has dorsal lamellar plates which are laid to overlap each other and incurved, while in the latter two, uncus has broad lamellar ones which are recurved. The length of the juxta in subsp. miyatai is shorter than in subsp. gnoma and the processes from juxta in the former are nearly symmetrical but those of the latter are asymmetrical, that is, the right process is longer than the left. The symmetrical juxta of the former may be considered more primitive than the latter, because asymmetrical ones are found related species, A. selene and A. neidhoeferi. 4. Hybrids of crossing among these subspecies showed the intermediate characters of their parents in the first (F_1) and the second (F_2) generations. 5. The difference of geographical distribution of the two species may have been due not only to differences of their food plants but also to difference of their invasion periods into Japanese Islands in Old ages (perhaps in cold climate Pleistocene). A. artemis is general feeder of broad-leaved deciduous trees. On the other hand, A. gnoma is oligophagous on alders (Alnus species). As was pointed out by PEIGLER (1986), A. gnoma would have changed it's food plant into alders in the glacial period. Perhaps, a factor preventing immigration of A. gnoma to Kyushu might have been effuse distribution of the food plant. 6. The allopatric distribution of two ssp. of A. gnoma, A. g. miyatai from Kozu-shima to Aoga-shima Islands and A. g. gnoma from Honshu to Izu-o-shima Islands, is particularly interesting. This phenomenon seems to be the result of difference of historical ages of the invasions of the two subspecies. It seems that A. g. miyatai did not specialize in the Izu Islands but arose in somewhere in the Continent Asia. After the settlement of miyatai, the Izu Islands were isolated and the new dominant subspecies, gnoma, could invaded only Izu-o-shima which is volcanic and the closest to Honshu.

The genus Mimopsestis was once discussed by MELL (1942) on the basis of the male genitalic structures for four S. Chinese species placed in Spilobasis HOULBERT, 1921, a junior objective synonym of Mimopsestis. However, they should be excluded from Mimopsestis as shown in the text. On the other hand, P. lineofracta and G. solena have never been mentioned taxonomically since their original descriptions, and judging from the morphological features, they are considered to form a compact generic group related to Mimopsestis.

The following five stations were selected. A: natural grassland; B: villa place; C: vegetable farm; D: cultivated meadow; E: golf course. In the St. A, both the numbers of species and of individuals were abundant. In the Sts. B, C and D the number of species decreased according to the increase of human actions, even if the number of individuals unchanged. When human actions increased to the maximum, both the numbers of species and of individuals in the butterfly community, reduced to the poorest level (St. E).

N2  - Interspecific hybrids between Mycalesis gotama fulginia FRUHSTORFER and M. madjicosa BUTLER were obtained by means of the cage pairing. When the females of Mycalesis gotama fulginia were crossed by the males of M. madjicosa amamiana FUJIOKA, the ratio of emergence was relatively high, 44.0-57.6 %. Emerged adults of the hybrids, however, were exclusively males. On the contrary, in the reversed crossing, in one strain, weakly deformed hybrid males emerged in low ratio of 8.1 %, but in other strains, all hybrids died until pupation. When the females of M. madjicosa amamiana were backcrossed by the male of hybrids between M. g. f female and M. m. a. male, seven males and one female emerged in low ratio, less than 10.0 %. All of these adults were also weakly deformed. This result suggests that the males of interspecific hybrids lack something of reproductive function. These results show that there is a reproductive isolation between the two species, Mycalesis gotama fulginia FRUHSTORFER and M. madjicosa BUTLER, as well as the results of my past experiments (TAKAHASHI, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1981 etc.).

N2  - A new nymphalid genus, Altiapa (Satyrinae), and twenty-six new species of butterflies from Irian Jaya and/or Papua New Guinea, comprising seventeen hesperiids, seven lycaenids, and two nymphalids, are described and illustrated. These are arranged systematically as follows: Hesperiidae (Hesperiinae) - Prada maria, Pastria grinpela, Kobrona sebana, K. zadma, K. lexa, K. sota, Sabera madrella, Mimene celiaba, M. saribana, M. ozada, M. verda, M. wara, Ocybadistes zelda, Telicota bulwa, T. sadrella, T. brandti, T. mimena; Lycaenidae (Miletinae) - Spalgis asmus; (Lycaeninae) - Arhopala doreena, Candalides afretta, Ionolyce selkon, Catopyrops zyx, C. holtra, Udara davenporti; Nymphalidae (Satyrinae) - Mycalesis giamana, Platypthima antapa. I. selkon and C. zyx are recorded from Bougainville Island, and C. holtra from the island of New Britain, both localities in Papua New Guinea. Five species (M. celiaba, T. sadrella, S. asmus, A. doreena, M. giamana) are recorded from Irian Jaya as well as Papua New Guinea. The remaining species are, to date, only recorded from Papua New Guinea. In addition the status of two previously described species are revised (stat. nov.). These are Udara kodama ELIOT and KAWAZOE, 1983 (Lycaenidae, Lycaeninae) and Platypthima septentrionalis NIEUWENHUIS and HOWARTH, 1969 (Nymphalidae, Satyrinae).

N2  - Embryonic development of the osmeteria was studied in Byasa (Atrophaneura) alcinous alcinous KLUG and Papilio protenor demetrius CRAMER (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae). Although B. (A.) alcinous and P. protenor belong to different genera, osmeterial formation is the same in both cases. After revolution of the embryo a pair of rudiments of osmeteria is formed on the dorsal wall of its prothoracic segment. Each rudiment then invaginates into the segment, and becomes subdivided into future gland and sac. During the embryogenesis the former differentiates into an ellipsoidal gland with a central cavity and the latter becomes a large protrusible sac. Early osmeterial development, either in B. alcinous or in P. protenor, is the same as that was previously observed in other species of Papilionidae. But later development of osmeteria differs from what had been described for Parnassius glacialis BUTLER and Luehdorfia japonica LEECH.

N2  - The genus Blastodacna WOCKE comprises about twelve species which are mostly distributed in the Palaearctic region and N. America. In the Far East region, no species of this group has been reported except Sinitinea pyrigalla and an unnamed species described by YANG (1977) from China. The venation and genitalia of pyrigalla YANG are characteristic of the genus Blastodacna WOCKE and there can be no doubt that Sinitinea YANG, 1977, syn. nov. is a junior synonym of Blantodacna WOCKE, 1876 In writing this paper I wish to express my sincere appreciation to Dr. J. D. BRADLEY, Commonwealth Institute of Entomology, London, for his help with the investigation of the species and critically reading the manuscript, and special thanks are due to Dr. Chin-Kun YANG, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing, China, for kindly writing to Dr. J.D.

N2  - The genus Ectropis HUBNER is a monophyletic group if it is strictly defined based on E. crepuscularia ([DENIS et SCHIFFERMULLER]), the type species of the genus, and its relatives (SATO, 1980, 1984). Among the Hypomecis-complex many Indo-Malayan and Palaearctic species were placed in Ectropis simply because they had fasciculate male antennae. Some of such species have already been transferred to other genera mainly based on genitalic characteristics, but there still remain many disparate elements in the genus Ectropis from South East Asia. So far as I am concerned, as to the Taiwanese species, only three species belong to Ectropis. The mature and immature characters of them will be described in this paper, together with preliminary notes on taxonomic treatment of the other Taiwanese non-Ectropis species.

N2  - A pyralid, Assara korbi (CARADJA), was found to attack selectively the galls of Schlechtendalia chinensis (BELL) on Rhus javanica L. in autumn. The larvae ( sometimes pupae) seemed to overwinter inside the galls and to emerge in the next spring. However, the life cycle from spring to early autumn still remains unclear. Eucoenogenes japonica KAWABE (Tortricidae) was confirmed to be a borer in the shoot of Rhus javanica in spring and summer, and an aphid-gall feeder in autumn. The overwintering stage was suggested to be mature larvae outside the gall. The host for these two species was first recorded from Japan.

Its meiotic chromosomes were examined again with adult males collected at Hamakoshimizu, Hokkaido, to confirm the haploid chromosome number established for the Bibi males. Thus, the Hama-koshimizu males of this subspecies were also found to have an n, 12-karyotype (Figs.1-3); 153 spermatocytes in metaphase (metaphase I, 86; metaphase II, 67) were observed on three males.

The plant groups include Anacardiaceae, Burseraceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Myrtaceae, and Liquidambar. Unavailability of these preferred hostplants in northern temperate regions has caused a shift of hostplant selection to Quercus, Acer, etc. whilst Pleistocene glaciation caused a shift to Pinus in at least three cases.

N2  - Chorionic ultrastructure of eggs were examined of six species of Attacus and one species each of Coscinocera and Archaeoattacus. Intrageneric differences between eggs of Attacus species were not very strong ; intergeneric differences between eggs of these three Indo-Australian genera were very conspicuous. Eggs of Attacus have honeycomb-like fossae surrounded by tiny aeropyles. The micropylar region is not distinctive from remaining regions of the chorion. Eggs of Archaeoattacus have tulip-like processes on the lateral surfaces closely resembling those recently found in Antheraea pernyi by other workers. Eggs deposited by females are highly preferable for study over those extracted from abdomens of dried specimens.

N2  - Some twenty-five years ago Dr. I.W.B. NYE inaugurated a revisional work of the genus Prophantis WARREN, 1896, type-species: Botys octoguttalis FELDER & ROGENHOFER, 1875, shortly after having been appointed a science officer of the Department of Entomology at the British Museum (Natural History). Before completion of his study on that genus, however, and until his retirement in 1984, he had had to devote all his energies to the preparation of manuscripts of "The Generic Names of Moths of the World", a monumental work in the field of taxonomy of moths. Inevitably many new species of Prophantis are still left unpublished. This paper was prepared in order to validate one of his manuscript names under permission of Dr. NYE, with the great assistance of Mr. M. SHAFFER of the same Department. I am deeply grateful to Dr. NYE and Mr. SHAFFER for their kind offices. My thanks are also due to the following donors of the specimens recorded hereinafter : S. AZUMA, K. JINBO, A. KAWAZOE, Y.

N2  - The genus Agrias (Nymphalidae) has been one of the most beautiful butterflies in the world. Although the genus Agrias contains only 4 to 6 species (REBILLARD, 1961; SHIZUKUISHI, 1980), more than 400 forms have been described (BARSELOU, 1983). Among them, Agrias narcissus tapajonus FASSL f. illustrissimus FASSL has been quite rare. The female has been turned up only once or twice (BARSELOU, personal communication). In addition, the range of the insects has been described to be the Rio Xingu (BARSELOU, 1983). This is the first record of a female of Agrias narcissus tapajonus f. illustrissimus captured in the range of the Rio Curua Una.

N2  - Major adult behaviors of Pieris rapae crucivora BOISDUVAL were analyzed functionally and their ecological topics were picked up (11 sectional conclusions), based on the field observation by 'single-individual trailing method'. Resting, nectar intake, flying, egg laying and interindividual behaviors were different sexually, seasonally and/or age-dependently. In interindividual behaviors, especially, functions of ascending fight and abdomen erecting were inferred with relation to age and/or population density, and functions of fluttering, wing folding and leaning which become effective during copulation as well. Based on 11 sectional conclusions, it was made clear that males continued to seek females which need males only once, and that consequently males drive females away out of home habitat.

N2  - Mr.Katsuhiko HORI captured many high-altitude butterflies between Mustang and Dhaulagiri in Central Nepal during the summer season 1981 and 1983. Among the butterflies, he found the new subspecies of Parnassius cephalus GR.-GR., described in this paper. The original description of Parnassius cephalus (by GRUM-GRSHIMAILO, 1891) is based on material from Amdo; to date, 11 further subspecies have been described. Although typically considered to be a Central Asian species it is in fact wide-ranging, being found from Kansu to Tsinghai, Szechwan, and South Tibet to East Kashmir, a similar distribution to Parnassius acco GRAY and Parnassius acdestis GR.-GR. Usually Central Asian Parnassius are more restricted. Subspecies occurring from Kansu to Tsinghai and Szechwan are very similar in wing shape and markings, but subsp. maharaja AVINOFF from Kashmir is superficially very different. Sometime it is treated as a good species, with the forewing-veins v11 (R_1) and v10 (R_2) consistently anastomosing, while the hindwing lacks both red and blue centred ocelli. from Tibet and North of Great Himalaya Range only two subspecies are known (subsp. rileyanus BRYK-Phuse La, near Rongchar Valley, 4800 m., Tibet, 1♀ Type; subsp. pythia H. ROTH-Tibu, west Gartok, 5000 m., Tibet, 1♀ Type). Besides these two subspecies, two specimens considered to represent rileyanus are know from Tibet, one from Lilung Valley and the other from Che La.

N2  - Larvae of Brenthis daphne iwatensis were collected at Bibi, Chitose-shi, Hokkaido. Its chromosomes were examined with both lactoacetic orcein squashes of testes and Carnoy air-dried Giemsa preparations of other tissues crashed in 60% acetic acid. The haploid chromosome number established is 12 in the male (Figs.1-3); counts were made in 381 spermatocyte metaphases (metaphase I:336; metaphase II:45) from three laboratory-reared pupae. The haploid complement comprizes two elements larger in size than the remaining ten. The occurrence of twenty-four diploid chromosomes was confirmed in mitoses in the testes and other tissues (Fig.4) of these pupae. Previously, an n, 14-karyotype was observed in the males of this subspecies from Asahikawa, Hokkaido (MAEKI, 1961). But, as stated above, such karyotype has not been encountered in the Bibi males examined.

N2  - During my 1981 and 1983 Thai expeditions, I was able to collect seven specimens of the Oriental genus Aeolanthes from the northern province of Chiang Mai with the assistance of my expedition colleagues. These specimens belong to four previously described species, Aeolanthes brochias MEYRICK, A. meniscias MEYRICK, A. deltogramma MEYRICK and A. rhodochrysa MEYRICK, all of which are here recorded from Thailand for the first time. This is the first record of Aeolanthes from Thailand. The specific determinations are based on comparisons of the Thai specimens with the types of the above-mentioned known species preserved in the collection of the British Museum (Natural History), London. These Thai specimens are deposited in the Entomological Laboratory, University of Osaka Prefecture, Sakai, and the Entomology and Zoology Division, Department of Agriculture, Bangkok. Before going further, I am much indebted to Drs H. KUROKO (Univ. Osaka Prefect.), A. LEWVANICH (Thai Dept. of Agric.), Y. ARITA (Meijo Univ.) and Y. YOSHIYASU (Kyoto Prefect. Univ.), all of my colleagues on the Expeditions, for their interest and help. I am also indebted to Dr T. WONGSIRI, Mr M. RUMAKOM and Mr C.

N2  - The montane Delias of the island of New Guinea form a highly variable group which includes many species-group taxa of uncertain status. We note the problems associated with the classification of the group and the necessity of establishing the identity of all named taxa to provide a framework within which new taxa may be placed. We discuss the taxonomic value of various characters which have been used by previous authors. We define the Delias aroae-cuningputi complex and the D. aroae group and describe and figure a total of 12 species-group taxa of the aroae group. Where possible we illustrate type specimens. We divide the group into four parts including two species-complexes within which we regard most taxa as being of uncertain status, but formally we treat them in binomial format in order to emphasise their individuality. We describe two new species, D. flavissima and D. subapicalis.

N2  - The life-history of Aporia potanini insularis SHIROZU from Taiwan is newly described and figured. Notes on the habitat and adult habits are also given. The larval foodplant of this pierid is a hemi-liana, Elaeagnus Thunbergii SERV. (Elaeagnaceae). The early stages of this species are very similar to those of Aporia hippia from Japan, but are distinguishable from the latter by the following respects: 4th (last) instar larva yellowish brown with greenish tinge, marked with broader dorsal and narrower subdorsal lines; pupa more sparsely black dotted, slenderer as a whole, and having longer cephalic projection bending dorsally with its apex weakly bilobed. The habitat is found in evergreen broad-leaved forest containing the foodplant along mountain streams (1300-1600m alt.) in the central mountain area (Hualien Pref.) of Taiwan. The time of appearance seems to be from the middle to end of May on the surveyed areas.

N2  - Phylogenetic analysis of mainly Asian species of the genus Ypthima was provided by SHIROZU and SHIMA (1979), but they did not give diagnoses of their specific and subspecific characters. FRUHSTORFER (1911) made an attempt to review the Indo-Australian species of the genus as a whole, but almost all other works on the genus subsequent to him dealt with the species only from a part of Asia. It is usually difficult to distinguish the species of the genus on their external characters, as they show considerable individual, seasonal and geographical variations. This has led to many misidentifications and confusions of synonymy. The aim of this work is to provide a taxonomic revision of the asterope-group supplemented by an identification guide to species and subspecies, and to note on their nomenclature and distribution. Following abbreviations are used for the institutions where the types or other specimens examined in this study are deposited.

N2  - In order to determine whether the distinctive damages on butterfly wings, so-called "beak marks", were inflicted only by birds' attacks, an experiment was carried out in the laboratory using butterflies of the genus Pieris as subjects. Control butterflies were put in a cage with branches as obstacles and were allowed to fly freely, while experimental butterflies were subjected to predatory attacks of caged birds (Varied Tits, Great Tits and Bush Warblers). The wing damages of both samples were then analyzed. It was concluded that large damages, especially large symmetrical damages, resulted only from birds' attacks, although not all symmetrical damages were caused by birds' attacks.

N2  - In order to reconsider phylogenetic relationships between Lasiommata deidamia EVERSMANN and L. interrupta FRUHSTORFER, crosses between these two species were conducted. The material of the former used was obtained from Hidaka ofHokkaido and that of the latter from Iwate-ken of Northern Honshu. Although the cross, deidamia♀×interrupta ♂, failed due to weakening of the female used, a mating between interrupta ♀ and deidamia ♂ was successful and yielded fertile progeny. Inbreedings were carried out until F_3. The emergences from obtained eggs were 100.0, 53.9 and 65.1 % in F_1, F_2, and F_3, respectively, and sex ratios were normal in each generation. These adults obtained were all healthy. Known morphological and ecological differences between the two species are only wing-markings of their adults. Therefore, judging from the results of the crosses and the above differences, it is suggested that L. interrupta should be treated as a subspecies of L. deidamia as FRUHSTORFER described in 1851.

N2  - It is well known that Menophra atrilineata (BUTLER) is an important pest of the mulberry, Morus spp., in Japan and Taiwan. This species is also distributed in Korea, China, Southeast Siberia and Southeast India. Founded on the bipectinate antenna in female WARREN (1894) established the genus Phthonandria for the reception of this species. WEHRLI (1941) added P.emarioides and its variety epistygna from China, and he suggested that Hemerophila cuneilinearia WILEMAN from Taiwan might be closely related to emarioides. Recently I had an opportunity to rearsome larvae of atrilineata in Taiwan, and found that all the adults emerged from them should be identified with cuneilinearia. Moreover I was able to examine the type-specimens of emarioides and epistygna through the courtesy of Dr. D. STUNING, Museum Alexander Koenig, Bonn. In this paper I give a taxonomic account of Menophra atrilineata (BUTLER), with notes on the genera Phthonandria and Menophra.

N2  - Cydia trasias was originally described from Beijing, China, by MEYRICK (1928), and then only recorded from Kunashir Island, the Kurils, by DANILEVSKY & KUZNETZOV (1968). Recently, this species has been discovered to occur in Japan, attacking sophora and maackia (Leguminosae). The sophora-feeding species referred to as Laspeyresia sp. by ZHANG (1983) in China is here considered to be conspecific with the present species. The morphology and biology of the species are briefly summarized below:

N2  - The Krakatau Islands, consisting of 4 islets, are situated in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra in Indonesia. As is well known, the islands were almost certainly completely sterilized by the world-famous big eruption in 1883. In association with the international research program on "100 years development of Krakatau and its surroundings" organized by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), the author visited there in 1982 to study the insect fauna of the islands. A total of 39 butterfly species were collected on the Krakataus, 29 on Panaitan Island and 18 at Carita, a small village along the west coast of Java. In the light of recent biogeographical theories, the faunistic features and recolonization of the Krakataus by butterflies are discussed, based on the collecting records of the present and previous surveys together with floral lists compiled by plant ecologists.

N2  - The nutritional effects of foodplants on larval growth and the oviposition preference of females were studied for E. hecabe. The larvae were reared with five different plants. The larvae which fed on L. bicolor, L. juncea and A. julibrissin developed normally, but all larvae on L. striata and I. pseudotinctoria died during the first-stage. The first three plants are nutritionally subequally suitable as food for the development of the larvae of E. hecabe, though L. bicolor was slightly superior to L. juncea and A. julibrissin with respect to developmental velocity and larval or pupal weight gain. The eggs of E. hecabe were found on threeplants; L. bicolor, L. juncea and A. julibrissin. Females of E. hecabe were observed in the field to deposit only on these three plants, although they alighted on other leguminous plants. The females were observed to oviposit preferably on L. juncea in the grassland. L. juncea and A. julibrissin grow in gaps in the forest and around forest edge rather than in the grassland. By utilizing these three plants, E. hecabe is considered to be able to inhabit a variety of habitats.

N2  - The genus Eristena WARREN, 1896, consists of 8 species known from the Oriental and Australian Regions, but it has not been recorded from Thailand at all. Through the examination of the Thai pyralid collection obtained by the Expeditions to Thailand in 1981 and 1983, I have found 2 species belonging to the genus. Both the species are new to science and are described hereinafter. The genus is characterized by the hindwing with the vien M_2 anastomosed with M_3 at the base as well as the long and ascending labial palpus, the narrow wings with the produced apices and others.

N2  - The genus Horipsestis was established by MATSUMURA in 1933 for H. teikichiana MATSUMURA, 1933, from Taiwan, and it was soon after cited by FORBES (1936) with the description of the male genitalia of H. teikichiana. However, these papers have rather been neglected by subsequent workers, and generic name Horipsestis has never been used thereafter. Recently, I have a chance to examine the genitalia slide of the male holotype of Horipsestis teikichiana, and I was aware of the fact that this species is conspecific with Polyploca aenea WILEMAN, 1911, described from Taiwan, for which INOUE (1982) proposed a new genus Neochropacha. On the other hand, Palimpsestis mushana MATSUMURA, 1931, described from Taiwan was recently sunk into Polyploca aenea WILEMAN as a junior synonym by INOUE (1976) when he recorded aenea from Japan. My detailed examination of MATSUMURA'S type-series and further material have revealed that mushana is a good species, never a synonym of aenea. Here I am going to redescribe the genus Horipsestis, with discussions on the above cited species-group taxa.

N2  - Neotogaria saitonis MATSUMURA, 1931, is a very characteristic thyatirid described from Taiwan. Since MATSUMURA'S original description (1931) and redescription (1933), no subsequent record on this species seems to have appeared in the entomological literature. Recently, I have examined a male specimen of this interesting species. In this paper, I will redescribe the species, with a redescription of the genus Neotogaria. On this occasion, some continental thyatirids will be transferred to this genus, based on the examination of the photographs of their type specimens deposited in the British Museum (Natural History), London.

N2  - In 1981 and 1983 I carried out scientific explorations in some districts of Thailand as a member of the Lepidopterological Expedition of the University of Osaka Prefecture to Thailand. In the course of the expeditions, a male and a female specimens of acrolepiid moths were collected by me in the northern mountainous district in 1983. Having examined the two specimens, I have been convinced that they are obviously conspecific with each other. The Thai species is described below as new to science. This is the first record of the family Acrolepiidae from Thailand.

N2  - Geographic variations of wing shape in Papilio bianor were studied by principal component analysis. The data were 3 lengths in forewing and 6 lengths in hindwing obtained from 137 specimens collected from 13 areas of Japan and neighboring countries. Four principal components were extracted accounting for 93.93% of the total variance. From the result of the present analysis, the four principal components were assumed to be the following indices: the size, the slenderness of the forewing, that of the hindwing, and the width of the hindwing. The results suggested that the geographical variation of Papilio bianor might be divided into the following 2 groups: 1. Chang-hai (China), Seoul, Jeju Do Is. (Korea), Honshu, Nakano Is., Yonaguni Is. (Japan), and Taiwan; 2. Amami, Okinawa, Ishigaki, Iriomote, Hachijo (Japan), and Hungtou (Taiwan) islands. The former group has a slender hindwing for a long F (length from hindwing base to end of vein 4) and the latter one has a thickset fore and hindwing for a short C (length from forewing apex to end of vein lb) and F.

N2  - In this paper, I am going to deal with four related genera of Thyatiridae: Demopsestis MATSUMURA, 1927, Takapsestis MATSUMURA, 1933, Neoploca MATSUMURA, 1927, and Asphalia HUBNER, [1821]. Demopsestis, Takapsestis and Neoploca were each established for the reception of a single species, viz. Asphalia punctigera BUTLER, 1885, Takapsestis wilemaniella MATSUMURA, 1933, and Xylina arctipennis BUTLER, 1878, respectively. Asphalia was proposed for the two European species, Noctua diluta [DENIS et SCHIFFERMULLER], 1775, and Noctua ruficollis [DENIS et SCHIFFERMULLER], 1775, and the latter was subsequently designated as the type-species of Asphalia by HARVEY, 1874. These genera have not been revised and the name Asphalia is not currently used by European authors, who consider it a junior synonym of Polyploca HUBNER, [1821]. "A." diluta is now treated as a sole member of the genus Cymatophorima SPULER, 1908. No further species has ever been included in the above genera. Through the kindness of Mr. M. R. HONEY of the British Museum (Natural History), London, I could study the photos of the male genitalia of several Thyatiridae described under the genera Polyploca or Palimpsestis HUBNER, [1821], and I learned that some of them should correctly be transferred into the genus Takapsestis. During my collecting trip to Taiwan, I obtained a fairly long series of specimens belonging to an undescribed species of the genus Demopsestis. The genus Epipsestis MATSUMURA, 1921, is also related to the genera discussed here, and it was mentioned by me in another paper (YOSHIMOTO, 1982).

N2  - A well-ordered list of the Nepalese Thyatiridae was for the first time compiled by WERNY (1968) on the basis of the collection of Zoologischen Staatssammlung in Munchen brought by G.EBERT'S (1962) and W.DIERL'S (1964) surveys; he listed 20 species under 9 genera, including the descriptions of one new genus, 4 new species* and 9 new subspecies*. Several species were fragmentarily mentioned from Nepal in my recent papers (1982; 1983); they are 8 (including 3 new) species of Epipsestis and 1 species of Nothoploca based upon the collection of the Japanese expedition to Nepal-Himalaya 1979 and 1981 from post-monsoon to late autumn. In the following list, I will enumerate 16 species under 9 genera, including one new genus and one new combination. The material used in this paper is composed of about a hundred specimens, which were mainly collected by the members of the Lepidopterological Research Expedition to Nepal-Himalaya in 1963 from June to August, organized by the Lepidopterological Society of Japan. The itinerary of this expedition was repeatedly presented in Special Bulletin of Lepidopterological Society of Japan, (2):iii-v (1966) and (4):ix-xi (1970). Almost all the specimens here recorded were taken by Mr. T. HARUTA and other members in Tamur Valley of Eastern Nepal; consequently I present only the collecting places in Tamur Valley and dates in 1963 in the enumeration of the specimens. Several specimens from other sources are shown with full data according to their labels. All the specimens from the Lepidopterological Research Expedition are now in Mr. T.HARUTA'S collection, but they will eventually be transferred to National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo.

N2  - The larval food plants of two satyrids, Acrophtalmia artemis FELDER, 1861 and Ragadia luzonia C. & R. FELDER, 1861 are ferns belonging to the genus Selaginella (Selaginellaceae, Selaginellas; Pteridophyta), which has not been previously reported as food plant of satyrid larvae in literature. The results of the morphological studies on the early stages as well as the unique food habits of these species seem to support MILLER'S opinion (1968) that the two genera Ragadia and Acrophtalmia are included in the subfamily Ragadiinae.

N2  - In Thailand the Glyphipterigid genus Glyphipterix has hitherto been represented by a single species, G. ditiorana (WALKER) (DIAKONOFF, 1982). During my stay in Thailand to make investigations on the Lepidoptera, I collected 15 specimens belonging to the genus Glyphipterix. Having examined them, I have found that nine of them are grouped into six unnamed species, which are described below as new to science; the remaining six specimens need to be further studied for specific identification. Holotypes of the new Thai species described in this paper are all preserved in the collection of Entomological Laboratory, University of Osaka Prefecture, Sakai, and the paratypes are deposited in the Entomological Laboratory, University of Osaka Prefecture and the Entomology and Zoology, Department of Agriculture, Bangkok. I wish to express my cordial thanks to Dr. S. MORIUTI, University of Osaka Prefecture, for his kindness in correcting the manuscript. Thanks are also due to Dr. T. WONGSIRI, Mr. M. RUMAKON and Dr. A. LEWVANICH, Department of Agriculture, for their kind help during my field survey in Thailand. I am indebetd to Mr. S. HONMA for the drawing of the figures in this paper.

N2  - Plau Tioman, the largest island in the Tioman Island Group, lies some 20 miles east off West Malaysian mainland, accompanying Plau Aru, Plau Pemangil and many other small islands. The Island Group has been well known in its conspicuous endemism in butterflies, especially in the subspecific differences between populations of the Island Group and those of Malaysian mainland or Sundaland. Among the nine specialists of the butterflies who visited these islands from 1916 to the present, WILCOCKS had discovered a new endemic species, which was described as Hasora wilcocki by ELIOT (1970), and STUBBS and HISLOP had made a good series of collections, in which ELIOT (1978) recognized 177 species including many new subspecies. ELIOT (1980) added 30 species to the butterfly fauna of Plau Tioman based on BRETT-DAVIS collection, of which 26 were new to the Tioman Island Group. The author twice visited Plau Tioman, in May 1980 and August 1981, and made butterfly collection between Kampong Lalang and Kampong Tekek at the west coast and along a path connecting Kampong Tekek of the west coast with Kampong Juara of the east coast from sea level to the highest altitude of 330 m. In spite of his short visits to the island, the author was able to find some unrecorded butterflies from the island, some of which are thought to be new subspecies of Malayan or continental species. According to ELIOT (1978), the butterflies of the Tioman Island Group are characterized by the "increased melanism", especially in the family Pieridae and in the females of the family Lycaenidae, and they are under the influence of Bornean fauna. The author generally accepts his opinion with some exceptions mentioned later. Some pierid and danaid specimens from Palu Tioman in the author's collection were already illustrated by YATA and MORISHITA in TSUKADA (1981). They are included in this paper, because there were no special references in their texts concerning the records on these butterflies from the island. In the following lines the author will record the butterflies newly known from Plau Tioman and describe 11 new subspecies. The detailed data on the localities are omitted in the list except for new taxa. The materials treated in this paper were collected by the author himself and are preserved in the author's private collection, including the type specimens.

The results are summarized as follows: 1. Artopoetes pryeri was most active in light intensity of 8,000-25,000 lux. It was assumed that the light intensity more than 50,000 lux acted as an inhibitor of the activity to this species. 2. Antigius attilia was most active in light intensity of 5,000-20,000 lux. It was assumed that the light intensity more than 50,000 lux acted as an inhibitor of the activity to this species. 3. Favonius orientalis was most active in light intensity of 15,000-35,000 lux. It was assumed that the light intensity more than 80,000 lux acted as an inhibitor of the activity to this species. 4. Chrysozephyrus brillantinus was most active in light intensity of 15,000-35,000 lux. It was assumed that the light intensity more than 50,000 lux acted as an inhibitor of the activity to this species. 5. Chrysozephyrus smaragdinus was most active in light intensity of 15,000-25,000 lux. It was assumed that the light intensity more than 50,000 lux acted as an inhibitor of the activity to this species. 6. The activity of these species were stimulated temporarily when the light intensity dropped more than 50,000 lux rapidly.

N2  - In December 1976 to January 1977, Mr. Akira YAMAMOTO collected several specimens of an interesting species of the genus Ypthima HUBNER at Mt. Apo, Mindanao, the Philippines. The same species was also collected by Mr. Yasusuke NISHIYAMA at the same locality in 1977 to 1978 and by myself in 1978. I have studied this species not only on its external morphological characters but on its habits in the field in comparison with the known species of Ypthima. Recently I have come to the conclusion that this is an undescribed species of the genus. In this paper I describe the new species and give biological notes on its adult habits. The present new species apparently belongs to the pandocus-group of this genus (SHIROZU & SHIMA, 1979) and seems to be most closely allied to Y. sempera FELDER, 1863, occurring in the Philippines. The discovery of a new species of the pandocusgroup from the Philippines is very interesting in considering the phylogenetic relationships and zoogeographical distribution of the group.

On the male external genitalia, the following character-states are characteristic; 1) the absence of mesosome, 2) valva with an acutely pointed long process at the middle portion of its ventral margin. On the musculature of male external genitalia, the m.5 (vinculum-valva) is very broad and well developed. Some types of mesosome in the male genital structure of Hepialidae are shortly discussed.

N2  - The genus Epipsestis MATSUMURA, 1921, has been represented by the following three species in Japan: E. ornata (LEECH, [1889]), E. nikkoensis (MATSUMURA, 1921) and E. perornata INOUE, 1972. As the result of my detailed examination of about 400 Nepalese specimens of autumnal thyatirids captured by Mr. M. OWADA, the National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo, during the 1979 expedition to Nepal-Himalaya, I am going to place in Epipsestis some Nepalese species formerly assigned to the genus Polyploca HUBNER, 1816, enlarging the category of the genus. However, Epipsestis will eventually be restricted to E. ornata (LEECH) by the future phylogenetic study. In this paper, ten species of Epipsestis from Japan and Nepal, including three new species from Nepal, will be enumerated, and a re-definition of this genus founded on them will be shown.

N2  - The monotypic genus Chandata MOORE, 1882, with its type-species Chandata partita MOORE, 1882, is one of the genera whose taxonomic status remains uncertain among a peripheral assemblage of Euplexia STEPHENS and/or Trachea OCHSENHEIMER. The arrangement made by HAMPSON (1908) and WARREN (1913) has never been revised or discussed on the basis of genitalic morphology. Through the kindness of Mr. M. OWADA of the National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo, I was given an opportunity to examine two males of Chandata partita MOORE and a fairly long series of its close relative from Nepal obtained by him during the zoological expedition to Nepal Himalaya 1979 made by the museum. After a careful study, I have reached the conclusion that the genus Chandata MOORE should be given a revalidated status and that the two known species now placed under Euplexia, E. bella (BUTLER, 1881) and E. aglaja KISHIDA et YOSHIMOTO, 1978, should be placed in this genus. On the other hand, I became aware of the fact that the Taiwanese specimens erroneously identified with Euplexia bella (BUTLER) by KISHIDA and YOSHIMOTO (1978) belonged to a new species. Further, I was able to examine Nepalese specimens similar to E. bella collected by the Lepidopterological Society of Japan Expedition to Nepal-Himalaya 1963 through the courtesy of Mr. S. SUGI, Tokyo. They also represent a different new species. In the present paper, I am going to give a re-definition of the genus Chandata MOORE, to describe the three new species and to redescribe E. aglaja based on additional material.

N2  - Though there are many geographic races of the family Pieridae endemic to Mindanao of the Philippines, species endemic to that island are very scarce. Of these, Delias levicki ROTHSCHILD, 1927 and D. apoensis TALBOT, 1928, both endemic to the mountain areas of Mindanao, are very peculiar species having no allies in the genus Delias HUBNER. During our collecting trip to that island made from July to August in 1981, we found a remarkable new species related to these Delias in the Tagubud Mountains of southeastern Mindanao. Since this new species is different in any points from levicki and apoensis, of which it stands more closely to levicki than to apoensis, the authors are going to describe it in the following lines as new to science.

N2  - Lethe kinabalensis OKUBO, 1979, was described from two females collected at Mt. Kinabalu, Sabah, E. Malaysia in August 1977. The species seems to be very rare, as far as we know, only one or two females having been captured. During his collecting trip to Sabah in August 1981, Kazuhisa OHTSUKA, the junior author, captured a specimen of the genus Lethe on Mt. Kinabalu. Our subsequent examination of this single male proved it to be the unknown male of Lethe kinabalensis. We herewith describe the male of L. kinabalensis and illustrate it together with the female (the holotype) for comparison.

N2  - No remarkable migration of the rice plant skipper, Parnara guttata BREMER et GREY, has been recorded in Shikoku, Kyushu and Ryukyu Islands in Japan. In 1978, a questionnaire on its migration was sent to 250 entomologists who live in theChugoku and these districts and in the Kinki Region where the migration is annually observed. Twenty-three persons answered the questionnaire. Two answers from None, southern Shikoku, and Shimonoseki, western Chugoku, suggested that a migration might occur in these areas, though other ones were negative. The persons who answered negatively seem to believe that a migration always occurs in mass. In 1978, however, only small numbers of migrants were observed even in Mie, Nara and Osaka in the Kinki Region. A map, showing where migrations have been observed, is presented.

Its haploid complement consists of 30 dot-shaped elements and no particular element is distinguished. Its relative, S. charonda HEWITSON, from Japan is characterized by an n, 29-karyotype containing two large markers. Thus, these two species of Sasakia are karyologically distinct.

N2  - This key should have been presented at the beginning of the series of papers on the taxonomic study of Japanese lepidopterous pupae by the author. A key to the pupae of families of the Lepidoptera given by MOSHER (1916) is difficult to apply to some of the Japanese representatives because the Palaearctic families not represented in the Nearctic fauna are excluded in it, and moreover some families are insufficiently defined. The author prepared a new key to 74 families based on the Japanese materials. Before going further the author expresses his appreciation to many friends who aided his investigation.

N2  - 1. Chromosomal features in the spermatogonial metaphase and anaphase. The investigations have been undertaken based on the chromosomal slides prepared according to the current air-drying squash method. Chromosomes were examined in spermatogonial metaphase and early anaphase in the following 7 butterfly-species: Papilio maackii (2n,60); Papilio bianor (2n,60); Polygonia c-aureum (2n,62); Argyreus hyperbius (2n,62); Curetis acuta (2n,58); Favonius latifasciatus (2n,48); and Narathura japonica (2n,48). They are reproduced in Figs.1-12. In general, the mitotic chromosomes have been furnished as objects for the determination of chromosomal form in organisms in numerous surveys of karyological studies. As a whole, the mitotic chromosomes provide favorite materials for chromosome analysis from the following reason that the chromosomes of M-I cells are usually presented by a structure of bivalents characterized by their chiasmata. On the basis of the chromosomal aspects derived from the mitotic metaphases observed in the above-mentioned species, the author was not able to obtain any evidence indicating that V- or J-shaped metacentric chromosomes are included in the diploid complements of the butterfly. As seen in micrographs of early anaphases shown in Figs.7-12, every chromosome divided each into two elements which took a parallel arrangement. With the advance of the stage these sister chromatids took the start-action to each opposite pole. The chromosomal features and behavior as seen at the early anaphase were nearly identical to those observed in some Hemiptera such as Euschistus and Solubea by HUGHES-SCHRADER & SCHRADER (1961). The latter authors have described in their paper that in anaphasic disjunction the separating chromatids remain parallel to each other as they move "broadside on" to the pole. 2. Chromosomal features and behavior in the M-I metaphase and anaphase. The following investigations were undertaken based on the chromosome preparations according to the ordinary acetoorcein squash method, and also phase contrast was applied for more detailed analysis. Chromosome features depicted at M-I metaphase and anaphase in the following two species: Graphium sarpedon (n,20) (butterfly) and Eumeta variegata (n,31) (moth), are presented in Figs.13-25. The prereductional phenomenon of the bivalents in Lepidoptera had been established on the basis of the behavior of fragment chromosomes studied through the mitotic and meiotic divisions of G. sarpedon (MAEKI and HAYASHI, 1979). It was shown that the first division was reductional, whereas the second division was equational. Here, noteworthy was the finding that the bivalent chromosomes of Lepidoptera were constructed by "a ring of four" (LA COUR, 1952) at the M-I metaphase (Figs.13-17,22-23). The general features of chromosomes of G.sarpedon and E. variegata at the M-I anaphase are remarkable by the appearance displaying "pseudo-V-shape" in outline (see Figs.18-21, 24-25). In the course of the first anaphase the two sister chromatids moved to the same pole, and then the two chromatids (or a half-bivalent) having the pseudo-V-shape spread gradually along a straight line from each other. It appeared that the spindle fibers attached themselves to the whole poleward surface of the two rods of each sister chromatid. This behavior followed closely the synchronized activity of their spindle fibers. Most reasonable estimation from the above observations seems to be in favor of the view that the formation of the "pseudo-V-shaped" chromosome results from the association of the two rod-shaped elements equipped with the diffuse kinetochore structure. 3. Chromosome morphology and behavior in the M-II cells. In the equatorial plate of M-II metaphase two sister chromatids of a rod-type appeared taking a linear arrangement in each, as seen in Fig.26. If the chromosomes were telocentric carrying a kinetochore at their terminal ends, those two sister chromatids should be arranged in parallel condition at the M-II metaphase. Further, the dyads with the parallel arrangement would appear radially directing their kinetochores toward the cell center, as schematically shown by OGUMA (1942)(Fig.49). Every chromosome divided, however, each into two elements taking a linear arrangement at metaphase and early anaphase as seen in figs. 26-40. Under this condition each chromosomal element appeared taking a form like "a tadpole" or "the head of a writing brush" in outline (Figs.26-31). This feature would be resulted from a bundle formation of the spindle-fibers : The fibers gather to the chromosomal part close to the cell pole, while condense longwise in another part. The above features of chromatids at the M-II metaphase would be related also to the location of centrosomes occurring in the meiosis-II stage and to the non-synchronized activity of the spindle-fibers. In the course of the second anaphase the two sister chromatids moved to the opposite poles: The anaphasic movement was found to be end-first to the pole. Then it seems probable that the chromatid being in the direction vertical to the pole may be shifted gradually to the horizontal direction. The horizontal arrangement of each monad through the anaphasic movement of the M-II chromosomes failed to be confirmed in detail in this investigation. This behavior is closely associated with the synchronized activity of their spindlefibers. The morphology and behavior of the M-II chromosomes in the lepidopteran species seemed to be in close coincidence to those observed in Cimex-species (Hemiptera) by UESHIMA (1966). The situation occurring in the chromosomes at M悠I metaphase and anaphase could be well understood only in the chromosomes equipped by the diffuse kinetochore structure. On the basis of the above findings it can be allowed to state that, in striking contrast to the mitotic behavior of chromosomes, the male meiosis of lepidopteran insects may be characterized by a definite restriction of kinetochore activity in the M-I and M-II chromosomes, as fairly demonstrated by HUGHES-SCHRADER & SCHRADER (1961) in hemipteran species. 4. Gamma-ray induced fragments of chromosomes in Graphium sarpedon. The radiation treatment was made in the Radiation Laboratory through the courtesy of Mr. H. Terada, the Research Institute of Microbial Disease, Osaka University. The materials for this study consisted of over 100 male larvae of Graphium sarpedon at the last-instar which had been bred in the laboratory from 1974 to 1973. The condition of irradiation was as follows: Distance 75cm; field size 12cm×12cm; dosage rate 53.5 R/min; Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation unit (Shimazu). In order to induce the fragmentation of chromosomes, 50 larvae were irradiated in each year: 12 larvae in group were irradiated each at dosages of 800R, 1000R, 1500R, and 2000R. Irradiated specimens were killed at intervals of 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 hrs after exposure. On dissection one testis from two males which were received the same dosage were prepared following the aceto-orcein squash method, while the other testis was fixed with Allen's P.F.A.-3 solution for the routine study. On cytological examinations, the specimens treated at 1500R and 2000R showed remarkable aberrations of chromosomes at the meiotic stage. The normal haploid chromosome-number of G. sarpedon was 20. The nuclear plates shown in Figs.53-54 and Fig.60 showed 21 chromosomes at the M-I metaphase, while Fig.59 showed 19 chromosomes in the same M-I phase. The above features resulted from the chromosomal fusion as well as from fragmentation during meiosis. Another noticeable was the feature that some of the chromosomes were being in a way ready to divide in part, as shown in Figs.51-52 and Figs.57-58. The chromosomes induced by the present gamma-irradiation experiments were represented by two divided elements each showing an ordinary kinetic manner as seen in Figs.55-56. The situation is suggestive of that the induced fragment chromosomes carry the kinetochore in each. 5.Behavior of a fragment chromosome in Graphium sarpedon. The author had an opportunity to find a supernumerary chromosome represented by a fragment in a larva of G. sarpedon bred in the laboratory in 1975. The supernumerary element occurred without exception in all nuclei of the spermatogonial cells (Figs.63-64). It seems apparent that the fragment may be produced by chromosome fragmentation which had taken place in certain early periods of spermatogonial proliferation. All nuclei at M-I always contained the element of the same nature (Figs.65-67), while there were two kinds of the M-II nuclei, one carrying the supernumerary and another having no such element in a proportion of 1:1 (Figs.69-70). The fragment chromosome divided in n, 21 nuclei into two elements: this picture was well illustrated in Figs.68 and 69. Thus, the evidence is indicative of that G. sarpedon is a species belonging to the pre-reduction group at meiosis. The fragment chromosome behaved in a quite regular manner during the whole course of both mitotic and meiotic divisions as shown in Figs.63-70. The above findings are strongly suggestive of that the fragment chromosome carries the kinetochore or centromere. General recognition available to us is that the chromosomes of lepidopteran insects are characterized by the holokinetic organization in general; it has been expected early in relation to genetic information in Lepidoptera.

N2  - Neope niphonica BUTLER was recently found in the Boso Peninsula, the southern end of the Kanto District, Central Japan. The new localities are perfectly isolated from the ones hitherto known by the Kanto Plain. In this peninsula, the species is found on the southern hills, called the Kiyosumi Mountains running from east to west. However, it has not been met with in the northern and coastal areas of the peninsula. The forewing length, the wing shape and the wing patterns of this race were measured and statistically calculated, and were compared with those of the specimens from other localities of Japan. It was separated as a new subspecies N. n. kiyosumiensis, whose name was derived from Mt. Kiyosumi in the peninsula.

N2  - Japanese representative of the genus Buzura WALKER has been treated as recursaria (WALKER) from India, and divided into two subspecies, superans (BUTLER) from the mainland and asahinai INOUE from the Ryukyus. I have felt some doubts as to whether the differences of the two subspecies in appearance and male genitalia are of specific or subspecific value. Recently I had an opportunity to examine some specimens of the two subspecies collected at the same time on Is. Yakushima and Is. Shimokoshikijima. My careful examination of many specimens of Buzura from Japan and adjacent areas revealed that superans and asahinai are distinct species and not conspecific with recurusaria, that confusa (STAUDINGER) from Ussuri is a subspecies of superans, and that Taiwanese population is worth naming as a different race of superans.

N2  - Inter-specific crossing between Mycalesis gotama fulginia FRUHSTORFER and M. madjicosa amamiana FUJIOKA was carried out by means of the cage pairing. When females of M. madjicosa amamiana were crossed by males of M. gotama fulginia, weakly deformed males emerged in a very low ratio, less than 2.6 percent, of emergence. On the contrary, when females of M. gotama fulginia were crossed by males of M. madjicosa amamiana, the ratio of emergence ascended to 12.2-54.3 percent and most of the emerged adults were appearently normal in spite of the fact that they were rather small in size as compared with their parents. These adults were, however, exclusively males (♂:♀=143:0). In control groups, emerged adults were normal and no abnormality was observed in the sex ratio. These results show that there is a reproductive isolation between the two species, Mycalesis gotama fulginia FRUHSTORFER and M. madiicosa amamiana FUJIOKA.

N2  - In 1978, the author collected 16 female butterflies of the jacintha-form, which had not been reared in Japan previously, of the Great Eggfly (Hypolimnas bolina L.) on Iriomote Island of the Yaeyama Islands, Japan. The butterflies were reared at four different places. Eggs were obtained from seven of the females and the hatchability of the eggs was fairly low. Of the seven butterflies (designated as P_1 females hereafter), five (A-E) produced individuals consisting wholly of the jacintha-form and the remaining F and G produced those consisting of the kezia-form. In the P_1 females that produced individuals of of the jacintha-form, only the female A produced males and females and the remaining four (B-E) gave birth to females only. The number of the males and females born of the female A was 16 and 51, respectively; the male being about one-third as many as the females. Of the 16 males, only seven could successfully expand their wings. The characteristics of the coloring and patterns of the P_1 females and their offspring were described. The P_1 females (A, C-E) with well developed submarginal spot rows on the hindwing produced invidisuals of the jacintha-form varying in pattern. However, in the case of the P_1 female B with rows of darkened spots, the jacintha-form offspring varied in pattern. The range of variation in this case was far greater than that in the former group. And the P_1 females F and G with poorly developed rows of spots both produced individuals of kezia-form, whose range of variation in coloring and patterns was narrower.

N2  - The genus Calicha was established by MOORE (1888) for the reception of a new species, retrahens MOORE from Darjeeling, India. HAMPSON (1895) sank the genus as a junior synonym of Boarmia TREITSCHKE, and later INOUE (1953) restored it for ornataria LEECH and its near allies. My close examination of some Asiatic species formerly assigned to Calicha and those preestimated by me to be congeneric revealed that they form a compact natural group together with two Japanese species which had previously been placed in Boarmia, with the exception of one species which will be transferred to other genus. In this paper four species of Calicha will be redescribed and one new genus Microcalicha will be erected to receive three species formerly assigned to Calicha or Boarmia. In larval descriptions, the terminology for the setae is based on HINTON's (1946) system. The thoracic and abdominal segments are referred to by the abbreviations T and A, respectively.

N2  - The late Prof. S. MATSUMURA described many species of Microlepidoptera from Japan in his "6000 illustrated insects of Japan" published in 1931. Until now, many of these forms have been reviewed in the light of recent taxonomic knowledge, but some ones have remained untouched. During the course of preparation of the glyphipterygid volume in "Microlepidoptera Palaearctica", Dr. A. DIAKONOFF examined the holotype of Simaethis sapporensis MATSUMURA, one of Glyphipterygids described inMATSUMURA's publication mentioned above. He informed Mr. Y. ARITA of his view that this form should not be referred to the Glyphiterygidae but to the Olethreutinae of the Tortricidae. On the other hand, I found a peculiar olethreutine form in northern Japan, which I consider to represent an undescribed genus. Mr. ARITA kindly sent me a coloured photograph of the type specimen of S. sapporensis with a copy of a fine drawing of its genitalia made by Mr. J. J. A. M. WESSENDORP. After referring to those illustrations, I am convinced that the peculiar olethreutine species, which I was just studying, is exactly conspecific with S. sapporensis. In accordance with the recommendation by Mr. ARITA, I will take this opportunity to redescribe S. sapporensis, and erect a new genus of the Tortricidae for the reception of this interesting form. Before going further, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. A. DIAKONOFF, Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden, for his suggestion and kind permission for the use in this article of the elaborate genitalic drawing by Mr. J. J. A. M. WASSENDORP of the same museum. Thanks are also due to Mr. Y. ARITA, Meijo University, Nagoya, and Dr. T. KUMATA, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, for their provision of informations about the type specimen, and to Mr. F. KOMAI, University of Osaka Prefecture, Sakai, for supplying some specimens for the study.

N2  - The lepidopterous fauna of the Nepal Hymalayas is rather poorly known, especially for nocturnal forms, because of the difficulty in making intensive collectings on the steep high mountains. In the autumn of 1979, I had an opportunity to visit Nepal as a member of an expedition made by the National Science Museum, Tokyo. I was fortunate to collect a large number of nocturnal moths in East Nepal, using a light-trap set with a portable generator, and in this collection many interesting autumnal species are included. In this paper, I am going to describe a new species of the genus Lophotyna on the basis of this collection. This genus was erected by HAMPSON (1910) for the typespecies, Mamestra albirena MOORE, 1867, from Sikkim and Bengal. BOURSIN (1956) discussed on its systematic position and added three more species, albosignata (MOORE, 1881) from Punjab and Afganistan, hoenei BOURSIN, 1956, from West China, and crinomima (WILTSHIRE, 1946) from Iran. In that paper, he illustrated the male genitalia of albirena, albosignata and hoenei (Taf. 31: 6-8), while the right valva and aedeagus of crinomima were figured in WILTSHIRE'S original description (p.121, fig.1). Judging from all the known collecting data of Lophotyna-species, it can be safely surmised that they occur in the autumn; the present new species was also collected in October and November. Before going further, I wish to express my hearty thanks to Dr. S.-I. UENO, under whose leadership this Nepal expedition 1979 was carried out, and also to Dr. Y. KUROSAWA of the National Science Museum (Nat. Hist.), Tokyo, who gave me an opportunity to participate in the project and valuable advice. In the field survey, I am indebted to the authorities of Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, for permission to conduct research and collect specimens in Nepal. I have also to thank all the members of the expedition for their kind aid and encouragement in the field.

N2  - Catocala praegnax was described by WALKER in 1858 from north China, and has been hitherto known to have three subspecies, praegnax WALKER from China, obliterata MENETRIES from Amur, and esther BUTLER from Japan and Ussuri (MELL, 1936). Previously SUGI (1965) recorded one female specimen of this species from Taiwan, but he did not mention its subspecific status. On July 2, 1970, I visited to Lushan-spa in central Taiwan and collected ten specimens of Catocala praegnax WALKER, and through the courtesy of Messers K. SAKAI, H. KEZUKA and M. OWADA, I could examine seven more specimens secured at Wushe, Lan-tou and Lushan-spa in central Taiwan from 1969 to 1974. These specimens are markedly different from those of the Continent and Japan, and Taiwanese population of Catocala praegnax are considered to represent a distinct subspecies.

N2  - The author noticed that the newly-hatched larvae of Luehdorfia japonica (hereafter referred to as LJ) and Luehdorfia puziloi (LP) behave differently when they start their very first meal. He then observed a number of egg batches of these species both in the wild and in captivity for comparison of patterns of behavior of newly-hatched larvae until they start feeding. 1. After hatching from the eggs normally deposited on the underside of a fresh leaf of the foodplant, LJ larvae crawl away to the basal margin of the leaf and start feeding near the petiole, while LP larvae take their first meal without wandering away from the site of oviposition, showing no preference for the basal margin. LP larvae from eggs experimentally transferred to LJ's local foodplant, Asarum takaoi, did not crawl to the basal margin but behaved as if on their natural foodplant, Asarum Sieboldii; the opposite experiment, however, brought divergent results, with some groups of LJ larvae behaving normally and others feeding in the normal LP fashion. LJ larvae, newly hatched or otherwise transferred to a new leaf, mostly chose the basal margin close to the petiole as the site of initial feeding. Thus, the difference in the choice of the initial feeding site between the two species appears to be due to a hereditary factor. 2. Both species lay eggs in batches, and the larvae lead a gregarious life so long as possible. In LJ, it is usually the first to hatch that plays the role of a leader to guide the others in the clutch to the initial feeding site. The second to hatch can occasionally be the leader. In either case, the leader crawls on until it comes across a vein, which is ridged on the underside. This the larva follows and ultimately reaches, by trial and error, the basal margin. It crawls about the petiole and descends a little along it, but returns to the basal margin and start feeding. The leader spins his way throughout, and the larvae to follow evidently take the same silk trail, strengthening it while walking. It is possible that the larvae's silk carries some pheromone that helps in their gregarious behavior. Once the first few larvae have established a feeding site, those hatching later in the same egg batch go to the feeding site without hesitation. 3. Why the newly-hatched LJ larvae are attracted to the basal margin of the leaf close to the petiole is not quite clear. One of the reasons may be that the larvae, through wandering near or on the petiole, confirm the route by which to reach another suitable food leaf.

N2  - In this paper we noted the life cycle and behavior of Parnassius glacialis BUTLER inhabiting a limited grass bed along the Kokai River (alt. 8 m) in Ibaraki Prefecture. The distinctive feature observed in the survey is that Parnassius glacialis BUTLERis flooded every year at the stage of eggs, and spends its whole life within the habitat definitely limited. The survey revealed that the yearly decrease of the population hints the impossibility of the permanent existence of Parnassius gracialis BUTLER in the above-mentioned grassland.

N2  - In the present paper, we are going to describe two new geographical races of butterflies from Mindanao, the Philippines, collected by our exploration of Mt. Malindang made in August of 1979. One of them belongs to Appias phoebe of Pieridae, and the other to Parantica dannatti of Danaidae. Appias phoebe has hitherto been known from the three islands, Luzon, Mindoro and Negros, and is differentiated into three geographical races, phoebe FELDER, zamorra FELDER and montana ROTHSCHILD, respectively. A form of this species is found for the first time from Mindanao. On the other hand, Parantica dannatti has been known so far only from the high mountains of Mindanao. Two geographical races have been recognized in the two subspecies: dannatti TALBOT (from Mt. Apo, southern Mindanao) and divataensis TAKEI et YAMAMOTO (from Mt. Hilonghilong, northeastern Mindanao). The present new subspecies inhabits Mt. Malindang in the northwestern part of the island. It is of much interest that three geographical races differing in markings and/or color pattern occur on three different mountains geographically isolated.

N2  - In 1979, I collected an elegant species of Microlepidoptera from Ishigaki Island, the Ryukyu Islands. As a result of ditailed investigation of its wing venation and genital structure and following advice of Dr. A. DIAKONOFF, Leiden, I decided to describe this species as new under the genus Phycodes GUENEE. This genus is of a circumtropical and subtropical distribution, and has been recorded from Africa, Arabia, India, Ceylon, China, Java, Borneo and the Philippines. The discovery of Phycodes from the Yaeyama Islands is of great interest for the study of the insect fauna of the Ryukyu Islands.

N2  - An interspecific hybrid larva between Luehdorfia japonica and L. puziloi has been introduced. So far, no larva or pupa of puziloi ♀×japonica ♂ has been known. The authors have reared one larva of this parentage and observed its morphology and behavior. 1) The authors caught a female of L. puziloi with a black sphragis at Oami, Nagano Prefecture, on May 3rd, 1976. That black sphragis appeared to have been made by a male of L. japonica. 2) The female laid fifty eggs on Asiasarum Sieboldii and only one egg hatched. 3) The larva was first reared on Asiasarum Sieboldii and later on Heterotropa blumei. It pupated 34 days after hatching. 4) The larva had more pale brown spots than those of L. puziloi. In general appearance, the larva resembled FI larvae from japonica ♀×puziloi ♂ crosses. 5) The larva was less active than those of L. puziloi. 6) The larva pupated in the 5th instar but the pupa died without hatching. However, it was found that a complete adult body with fully colored wings had been formed.

N2  - Records of a migratory and nearly cosmopolitan species, Peridroma saucia (HUBNER), had been lacking from eastern Asia including Japan until recent years (OWADA, 1977). However, several individuals have been captured in the south-western region of Japan since 1975. Through a continuous survey of moths converged to light, since July, 1977, at the ridge (alt. 780 m) of Mt. Rokkosan, Dr. M. OGATA and the author captured 51 individuals. Based upon these specimens and the published literatures, following problems were studied and discussed. 1. The specimens can be divided into two forms based on the coloration of forewing. One is dark reddish black type, which is identified as f. saucia HUBNER, and another is yellowish brown type, identified as f. margaritosa HAWORTH. 2. Variations in the wing shape were quantitatively expressed as wing-width index, and notes on the factors regulating wing shape in insects were given. 3. From the literatures and the present records, problems on migratorial (dispersal) and behavioral habits of P. saucia were summarized. 4. In conclusion, it has been postulated that the species is a versatile wanderer to open environments, which is mainly created by human activities. Furthermore, the presence of different types of adaptation in Peridroma is suggested; namely, the remarkable adaptive divergence in such the isolated islands as Hawaii, and the extreme extension of distribution by a single migratory species as represented by P. saucia.

N2  - Three new species (two from Japan and one from Taiwan) will be described, eight species-group names will be sunk as junior synonyms, one species will be reduced to a subspecies, and one species will be placed in other genus by transferring from the originally combined genus. The last species is currently placed in the Acontiinae, Noctuidae, but it was added in this paper because its junior synonym was originally described as belonging to the Lithosiinae. Unless stated otherwise, all the specimens recorded in this paper are in my private collection.

N2  - During a survey of the microlepidopterous fauna of Ishigaki Island, the Ryukyu Islands, in 1978, I discovered three apparently undescribed species of Glyphipterix to be described and figured in this paper. No records have so far been made on the fauna of the Glyphipterigidae sensu stricto of Ishigaki Island. The type-series will be deposited in the collection of the Zoological Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Meijo University.

N2  - During a collecting trip to Mindanao, the Philippines, a series of Parantica dannatti different from the nominate subspecies was captured. Although the locality of the nominate subspecies was given by TALBOT only as the Philippines, possibly Mindanao, specimens obtained on Mt. Apo of southeastern Mindanao accord well with his description. The specimens from northeastern Mindanao to be dealt with in this paper are evidently different from them and are regarded as a new subspecies of P. dannatti. Danaus apoxanthus CLENCH, 1958, described from Mt. Apo should be regarded as a synonym of the nominated subspecies of P. dannatti.

N2  - Danaidae collected on Ambon Island, Indonesia, are reported with some observations on the seasonal variation. The following results have been obtained from this study: 1) E. climena melina GODORT, another subspecies of E. climena climena CRAMER, is not likely to be distributed there. 2) The specimens recognized as a subspecies of latifasciata WEYMER were newly recorded there. The new one, two males and a female, have a pair of very long grey-white stripes in parallel in space lb on the undersisde of forewings. This unique characteristic is absent not only in other Euploea but also in other subspecies of latifasciata in Sulawesi and north Moluccas. For this reason, this might be regarded as an independent species, but further study is required for the final decision.

N2  - A problem of the "species" of "Mycalesis gotarna Moore" (Lepidoptera : Satyridae) was discussed, based on the results of the inter-subspecific and interracia1 crossings of this butterfly and on the morphological and ecological characteristics of the larva and adult of every subspecies. Materials used for crossings are as follows : the subsepcies fulginia Fruhstorfer from the mainland of Japan, amamiana Fujioka from Amami Island and Okinawa Island and madjicosa Butler from Ishigaki Island. The results suggest that "Mycalesis gotama Moore" is to be separated into the two distinct species, Mycalesis gotama Moore and M. madjicosa Butler. The former consists of the four subspecies, fuiginia Fruhstorfer (the mainland of Japan), gotarna Moore (Korea and China), charaka Moore (Assam, Burma, Annam and Tonkin) and nanda Fruhstorfer (Formosa) and the latter includes the two subspecies, amamiana Fujioka (the Amami Islands and the Okinawa Islands) and madjicosa Butler (the Yaeyama Islands).

N2  - The male genital structure of Hepialidae has been investigated by many authors, because this family is thought to be one of the most important families in Lepidoptera in discussing the phylogeny of the order. As a matter of fact, the male genital structure of Hepialidae is widely different from that of Ditrysia in several respects. However, the authors who have investigated the male genital structure of Hepialidae have used their own terminology rather ambiguously in their discussions and descriptions and this has led to serious confusion in its terminology. In this paper I summarized the terminologies proposed by four authors, Eyer (1924), Philpott (1927), Stekol'nikov (1967) and Birket-Smith (1974 b) in Table 1. As a result of my study, I found that terminology of Birket-Smith, which is mainly based on the intrinsic musculature of male genitalia, is the most useful to describe these specializations clearly. Accordingly, I adopted twin process, processus momenti, valvefla, mesosome and tabulatum from his definition and used these in my descriptions of five species of Hepialidae from Europe, Japan and Formosa which were appeared in this paper. The terms, vinculum, tegumen, saccus and valva, which have hitherto been commonly used, were also used in this paper.

N2  - There is a fine revision of the genus Ptychandra by H. J. Banks, J. D. Holloway and H. S. Barlow (1976). But they seem not to have examined the material from Mt. Apo, Mindanao. I had the chance to examine some specimens of Ptychandra from Mt. Apo. To my surprise, all of them do not agree well with any of the described species according to the key shown in the above-mentioned revision. In addition, I have found that gnathi and valvae of male genitalia tend to vary even in the same specimen, that is to say, the shape of right and left gnathos or valva differs each other in some specimens. So I think we should not attach great importance to the genitalia of the genus. The holotypes are to be preserved in the Osaka Museum of Natural History.

N2  - The time of emergence of Clania variegata was studied in special reference to the relation between sex and the period of emergence. Two surveys were made in Mie Prefecture in 1971 as well as in Hyogo Prefecture in 1977, revealing that the female imagos emerged earlier than the male imagos. It was the reverse of what has been really observed in the other insects generally. Accordingly, the peak incidence of emergence was much earlier in the predominantly female group than in the predominantly male group. Sex ratios differed in the two groups : males were 55.7 and 36.0 per cent respectively. The cause of this difference in sex-ratio remains unsolved.

Eleven eggs and a 3rd instar larva were found on Rhamnus japonica var. decipiens Maxim. at the same locality in the next year, and they were reared to the adults. These specimens, 7♂♂ 6♀♀, were compared with the nominate subspecies, iyonis, from Mt. Saragamine, and with subsp. kibiensis, from Okayama Pref. They were found to be intermediate in some characters between iyonis and kibiensis.

N2  - Observations on sexual behaviour of the small copper, Lycaena phlaeas daimio Seitz were performed at Fukuoka in June and July from 1974 to 1977. The mating behaviour was initiated with approaching to females in flight by males which left off resting or feeding. The males, however, usually failed in successful mating because the females exhibited some mate-avoiding behaviour. The main types of the mate-avoiding behaviour were "fluttering-walk" (walking accompanied with fluttering wings) and rapid flying-away, the former being exhibited most frequently not only by impregnated females but virgin ones. The fluttering-walk seemed to have no function as a sign-stimulus to prevent males from copulation but a merely mechanical effect. It was only three cases out of 164 occasions observed that males successfully copulated with females. These females exhibited fluttering-walk before they became receptive attitude, and then the males copulated without any specialized courtship display except for the pursuit of females with wings half-opened. When virgin females reared in laboratory were presented in front of perching males, females less than three days old avoided copulation more frequently than those three or four days old. The similarity between pre-mating behaviour and mate-avoiding behaviour in butterflies was pointed out, and a breaf discussion was presented, i. e., it was probably impossible that the mate-avoiding behaviour could have evolved as a sign-stimulus.

N2  - The author reported the two endemic Pronophiline butterflies to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, northern Colombia, Sabatoga nevada Kruger and Lymanopoda caeruleata Godman & Salvin, which were collected in the Sierra Nevada during the Scientific Expedition of Shizuoka University to the Colombian Andes, 1967 (Takahashi, 1976). Subsequently, Adams, & Bernard, (1977) revised the 24 species of the Pronophilini knownfrom the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta based on their own research in the Sierra Nevada and examining a plenty of specimens collected by them and those preserved in the British Museum (Natural History). They established three new genera, three new species and four new subspecies. They confirmed the distributions of the 13 endemic Pronophilines in this isolated mountain range. The author collected 16 species of the Pronophilini during the expedition above mentioned and reports here the data and some ecological notes of the 14 species of this tribe with illustrations of male genitalia as a second report. The endemic species collected during the expedition are as follows : Sabatoga nevada, Lymanopoda caeru!eata, Manerebia nevadensis, Sierrasteroma polyxo, Physcopedaliodes symmachus, Pedaliodes leucocheilus, P. tyrrheus, P. phazania, Paramo oculata, and Pronophila juliani.

N2  - In the present paper, I noted six species of butterflies from Ussuri and Korea, of which two have been described as new subspecies and one has been given a new status. In Neptis themis of Central Korea, all markings of both wings are not yellow, but whitish and are more reduced than in other subspecies. Particularly, the margins of the markings of the space 2, 3, 5, 6, are not clearly defined, and tend to be reduced. So I named it ssp. kumgangsana nov.. Favonius orientalis schischkini described by the late Prof. A. I. Kurentzov (1970) is not a subspecies of orientalis, but a good species. F. schischkini is different from the original orientalis in some important points: 1) Generally smaller than orientalis of Japan (Honshu). 2) Upperside of wings in male is metallic yellowish green. (that of orientalis from Honshu in male is dull green.) 3) Ground colour of underside in both sexes is somewhat brownish grey. 4) In male genitalia, the fore part of valve is gradually pointed towards the tip, its inner side is not hollowed out as in orientalis, the dentate part is longer. The true orientalis from Ussuri is larger in size and the metallic green of upperside in male is more deeply bluish, the apex of forewing of both sexes is more pointed. In male genitalia, the strong dilatation at the middle part of brachium and hollowing of innerside of fore part of valve is not so remarkable as in the original orientalis. By above-mentioned characteristics, I named the Ussuri orientalis the subspecies primoriensis nov..

N2  - In this paper are discussed synonymy and subspeciation of two Species of East Asiatic Epicopeia, mencia Moore and hainesii Holland. E. mencia Moore. This species is found from the Ussuri district, Manchuria, north and east China, Korea and Taiwan. Geographic variation is not recognized by my comparison of Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese specimens, though there are two forms : normal and white-banded. Transitional varieties of various degrees are also found. The synonymy of this unstable species stated in this paper are: Epicopeia mencia Moore, 1874, Proc, Zool. Soc. Lond. 1874 : 578, p1. 67 : 8.

Syn. nov. E. hirayamaj Matsumura, 1935, Insecta. Matsumurana, 9 : 123, figs. E. hainesii Holland. The distributiion of this species is similar to that of the preceding species, but its range extends to Japan. Geographic variation is obvious, and the following subspecies are demonstrated in this paper E. hainesii Izainesii Holland, 1889, Trans. Am. Entomol. Soc. 16 : 72. Mainland of Japan : southeast Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. E. hainesii sinicaria Leech, 1897, Ann. Mag. nat. Hist. (6) 19 : 181. Central, east and west China. Distinguished from the nominate subspecies by absence of red spot in ceilule 7 of hindwing. E. Ii. mipallida Oberthur and E. Ii. p zllescens Oberthur from Tibet and W. China, respectively, are probably not distinguishable from sinicaria. E. hainesii matsumurai Okano, 1973, Artes Liberales (Coll. of Liberal Arts, Iwate Univ. ), 13 82, p1. 2 : 1-8 p1. 3 : 4, 5. Taiwan. As in the above subspecies, the red spot in cellule 7 is absent on upper and under surface, but marginal red spots larger and tail broader and shorter than in the two subspecies cited above. Besides blackish normal form, there are specimens with white ground colour and also intermediate forms connecting the two forms. E. hainesii tsushimana subsp. nov. Found on the island of Tsushima; the same subspecies may be discovered from south Korea in future. The red spot in cellule 7 of hindwing absent or almost vanished on upper surface, but it is present on under surface. Forewing with M simple in cell, not consisting a triangular areole by branching of vein M at near the end of cell, while in the other subspecies the areole in cell is almost always present. Tail long and slender as in sinicaria.

N2  - It has been known since 1930 that Pieris canidia is distributed in the Tsushima Islands located close to Korea. To consider natural history of this species some surveys were made from the zoogeographical and other viewpoints, and discussions are given as much as possible. 1. The form found in the Tsushima Islands is also common in Korea and the Southern Manchuria, and its range is separated considerably from the neighbouring one which extends from Formosa and Central China to Indo-China (Fig. 1). 2. Comparing with the nominate subspecies distributed from Formosa and C. China to IndoChina, the form from the Tsushima Islands is distinctly smaller and having several different wing characters as follows. On upperside of forewing inner margin of apical patch is more weakly insized at space 5, and marking of space 3 is larger and more conspicuous. Marginal spots on upperside of hindwing are smaller, and ground colour of underside of hind wing white, looks more whitish owing to reduction of black scales (Fig. 3). 3. As for the subspecific name for the Tsushima form, kaolicola Bryk, 1946 (type locality: Genzan, N. Korea) should be used, since there are not conspicuous differences between the Korean form and the former. The name juba Fruhstorfer should not be used any more for the Tsushima form of canidia. 4. In the Tsushima Islands they seem to prefer coastal area to inland area for habitats (Fig. 4). Adults fly at sunny site near the margin of forest generally, and are most abundantly seen at such environment where one side is steep slope covered with forest and the other side is flat openland. 5. As the host plants the following cruciferous species which are mostly prehistoric naturalized or naturalized plants are so far known: - Cardamine flexuosa, Lepidium virginicum, Nasturtium officinale, Rorippa indica and R. dubia. In addition, Arabis stelleri var. japonica and Cardamine scutata which are both wild plants were newly confirmed. The former plant inhabits coastal environment where adults are most frequently seen. As it was ascertained that many larvae were living on this plant, it is presumed to be the basic host plant of canidia (Fig. 5). 6. They seem to have six generations per year. Adults are most abundant in the first generation appearing in middle June (Fig. 6). 7. Oviposition takes place on upperside or underside of leaf. Younger larvae feed on underside of leaf. Older larvae climb up stem and eat fruit from tip, and keep body upside-down when not feeding. 8. It is presumed that canidia reached the Tsushima Islands from Korea along coastal area, depending upon Arabis stelleri var. japonica, in the past geologic age when the sea level was much lower.

N2  - We have in Japan two species belonging to the genus Ladoga: camilla and glorifica. The former is widely distributed over Japan from Hokkaido southwards to Kyushu, while the latter is strictly endemic to Honshu and absent from abroad. They are usually sympatric in Honshu. In this paper, the zoo-geographical characters are analyzed from an ecological standpoint, especially from their larval foodplants. Both field surveys and experimental studies disclosed that the larval food-plants of L. camilla have wide spectrum to all subgenera and sections of the genus Lonicera and Weigela (Caprifoliaceae). On the contrary, those of L. glorifica are restricted only to a certain number of species of Lonicera. L. camilla prefers the forest margine of the cold temperate zone of Eurasia, where the larval food-plants belonging to Sect. Coeloxylosteum of the genus Lonicera grows abundantly. In Japan, the warm temperate zone is also attractive to Weigela, which may cause the southward extension of the range of L. camilla. On the other hand, the main haunt of L. glorifica is the light shrubland of comparatively dry regions in the warm temperate zone, where the main food-plant of L. glorifica. Lonicera japonica covers the crown of the shrubs. The northernmost ranges of both L. glorifica and Lonicera japonica are almst the same. The zoo-geographical relations between L. camilla and L. glorifica in Japan bears a close resemblance to those between L. camilla and L. reducta in Europe. The records of the larval food-plants of Japanese Ladoga hitherto known are also reviewed with some comments.

N2  - Pithecops fulgens (Polyommatinae) occurs in Assam, Formosa and Japan. In our country this species is distributed only in the island of Tsushima. Little is known about the life-history, therefore the authors have researched it as well as the zoo-geographical aspect since 1973, in cooperation with the Survey on Tsushima Biological Researches by the Nagasaki Biological Society. The following results have so far been obtained. 1. This species is only found from the north-western parts of the Tsushima island, extending northwards to Kawachi and Izmi of Kamitsushima-cho and southwards to Mine and Okubo of Mine-cho. It is absent from the east coastal areas of there. 2. It inhabits in the darker, moist cedar forests, where the following larval food-plants (Leguminosae) grow abundantly. Demodium oldhamii Oliver D. laxum DC. D. osphyllum DC. D. fallax Schindl. D. fallax Schindi. var dilatatum Nakai D. podocarpum DC. 3. The butterfly is on the wing from early May to the middle of October. There are five broods in the year. The spring form is larger than the summer one. It visits various flowers in bloom, which serve nectar, and occasionally sucks water on muddy ground. 4. The egg is laid singly on a new bud of the larval food-plants in spring, and siso on the petal in summer. The larva hatches three day after oviposition, and feeds the buds or petals. It may eat the leaves, but does not remain there. 5. The last instar larva makes its nest before pupating. In spring, it bits partially the underside of the petiole, binds up two of the three drooping leaflets with silk, and then pupates on the silk-lined main vein near the base directing the head toward the leaflet-apex. In July and August, the last instar larva feeds the petals. When fully grown, it moves down the stem and makes the nest on the undersurface of the lower leaflet directing the head in generl toward the leaflet-tip. Some larvae pupate on the spikelet downwards. The larval stage is approximately 17 days. In autumn, the last instar larva makes the nest with leaflets, which falls down in late autumn naturally. It passes the winter and pupates in the nest in April without having any food after hibernation. The pupal stage ranges from 8 to 10 days. 6. The nesting behaviour of P. fulgens seems apparently to be similar to that of the first instar larva of Arhopalini and to the self-hiding behaviour of Theclini, but the nature is supposed to be essentially different.

N2  - The subfamily Archiearinae, probably the most primitive group of Geometridae, is represented by two species in Japan : Archiearis parthenias Linnaeus (subsp. bella Inoue & subsp. elegans Inoue) and A. notha Hubner (subsp. okanoi Inoue). In this paper the author described the larvae of these species. For the nomenclature of the setae Hinton's system (1946) is adopted. The thoracic and abdominal segments are referred to as T1 to T3 and A1 to A9 respectively. These two species are closely related to one another. Slight differences can be found in the labrum and mandible, but the most useful character for separation of species is the colour pattern. These species have the following characters, commonly found among the larvae of Geometridae. Lateral setal group bisetose on T1 ; subventral setal group bisetose on T1 and unisetose on T2 and T3 seta CD1 on anal proleg borne on a tubercle; seta L4, the additional subprimary lateral seta, present on A1 to A7 ; subanal plate produced posterior into a blunt tip. The presence of ventral prolegs on A3 to A5 may serve to distinguish this subfamily from all the other subfamilies of Geometridae. They are gradually reduced from A5 to A3. Subventral setal group unisetose on Al and bisetose on A2. Reduced prolegs of A3 to A5 with 3 external setae respectively, and ventral proleg of A6 with 5 or 6 external setae. Seta CD2 on anal proleg almost level with or slightly below level of seta L2. Crotchets of ventral and anal prolegs biordinal and complete ; those of A3 to A5 forming an incomplete circle. Japanese species are closely related to A. infans Moeschler from North America, of which larva was described by Singh (1959). A. parthenias elegans feeding on Betula platyphylla var. japonica and A. notha okanoi on Populus nigra var. italica.

N2  - In this paper, the author reports the validities of the scientific names of the two Japanese species belonging to the genus Neope, which have been recently separated as the distinct species. They should be treated as follows: Neope goschkevitschii (Menetries, 1857) =N. japonica Butler, 1867 (Distributions : endemic to the main islands of Japan) Neope niphonica Butler, 1881 =N. goschkevitschii solowiyofkae Matsumura, 1911 =N. goschkevitschii kurilensis Matsumura, 1928 (Distributions : Sakhalin, the Southern Kuriles and Japan) ssp. marumoi Esaki et Umeno, 1929 (Distribution : Yaku I. of Kagoshima Prefecture) The type-specimen of N. goschkevitschii is proven to be captured by Goschkevitsch himself in the spring of 1855 at Shimoda, Heda or its neighbourhood of Shizuoka Prefecture from the historical analysis of Goschkevitsch's itineraries. The morphological and ecological characters of these two species are also summarized and introduced.

N2  - Triphaenopsis Butler, 1878, has been treated as a genus consisting of middle-sized moths with yellow-banded hind wings occurring in the East Asia. The species in the genus are superficially similar to one another, but their genitalia have not been examined critically in order to understand their relationship. Sugi (1962), when described Triphaenopsis jezoensis from Hokkaido, Japan, illustrated the male genitalia of four species of the genus from Japan. The genus Triphaenopsis may ultimately be restricted to the following four species : lucilla Butler (type species of the genus), jezoensis Sugi, cinerescens Butler and postflava Leech. A continental species, oberthueri Staudinger, ranging east to the Island of Tsushima, Japan, was placed in Triphaenopsis by Warren, 1911, together with some other continental species formerly treated as members of Polyphaenis Boisduval by Hampson (1908). But the male and female genital organ of oberthueri is obvious dissimilar to the above four species. For this and a new species from Formosa we propose a new genus by the following features.

N2  - 1. One young larva and one squeezed egg of Papilio hipponous were obtained in Bohol, Philippines and reared on Citrus. 2. Young larvae of P. hipponous resembled those of P. polytes or P. alphenor ledebouria. Ground color of 5th instar larvae of P. hipponous was light reddish brown when moulted, although one larva became green with yellow mottling one day after moulting and the other brownish green. 3. Pupae were green and resembled those of P. bianor. 4. One pupa died next day after pupation and the other pupa diapaused for about 2 months at the conditions of 25℃ and 15-hour light a day. This individual was kept at room temperature in the Philippines for two weeks after pupation. 5. Interspecific hybrids between P. hipponous female and P. alphenor ledebouria male were obtained at the rearing room under 25℃ and 15-hour light a day in Nanzan University. The hybrids emerged were tailed males only and they were all sterile. Their immature stages were intermediate between the parental species in general.

N2  - 1. Territory is defined as "any defended area" (Noble, 1939). When keeping the territories makes any regulating effect on the social life of animals, the author prefers to use a term "territoriality" or "territorialism" on that system (Ito, 1966). 2. Home range would be defined as "normal activity range of individuals or groups in one daily or houry period". 3. This paper shows the analytical methods of the activities in a home range below-described. 1) Observation-area curve (Odum & Kuenzler, 1955). 2) Activity radius (Dice & Clark, 1952). 3) Displacement range (This paper). 4. On April 8, 1973, the home range of Polygonia c-aureum called "S" (22. 2m^2) and that of Inachis io geisha called "T" (11.7m^2) were overlapped. This would be the case that the interspecific territory of "T" was established in the intraspecific territory of "S". Interspecific territory of Inachis io geisha called "U" (63. 7m^2) was established in the home range (130.4m^2) on April 9, 1973. 5. On August 31, 1973 the territory of Kaniska canace no-jaonicum called "L" was established arround the feeding site. The range of the territory was restricted within the radius about 30 cm while the size of home range was 31.9m^2. 6. Scott (1974a) stated that territory is absent in butterflies. But, in some species of butterflies, there exists an area, where other individuals can not intrude owing to the dominant's territorial behaviours. Accordingly, it should be called a"territory". 7. Dominant holds one or several resting points in the home range, and makes patrolling flights and chasing flights from these points. This would be a basic behaviour in a home range in butterflies. And the activities would be classified into two types : "type of resting" and "type of circular flight". 8. There would be two kinds of territories in butterflies, which are related to mating or feeding. These are the two of three main factors on animal's territories stated by Ito (1966).

N2  - The Green-veined white butterfly in the Himalayas has long been considered as the geographical race of Pieris napi or P. melete by most lepidopterists. By careful examination of a male specimen captured at Takushindou, east of Katmandu, Nepal, it becomes clear that distinct species belonging to the me'ete species group (sensu Warren) inhabit throughout the range. The specimen is treated tentatively Pieris montana Verity in this report.

N2  - Diapause in the swallowtail butterfly, Papilio bianor dehaanii C. et R. Felder, occurs in the pupal stage. This diapause is though tto be induced by a short photoperiod during the larval stage like in Papilio xuthus L. (Hidaka and Hirai, 1970). The present paper deals with the photoperiodic reaction in the Hokkaido population of P. bianor dehaanii which inhabits near the northern limit of thirs species.

N2  - The larva and pupa of Rhagastis trilineata Matsumura in Japan are described. These are evidently allied to R. albomarginatus Rothschild from north India and China. The larva, the food-plant of whichis Hydrangea macrophylla (Saxifragaceae), is green with conical protruded eye-mark on the 1st abdominal segment. The eye-mark is rounded and yellow encircled with a double line, black outside and sky blue inside, and possesses an elliptical black pupil bordered with a sky blue fine line centre. The horn is purplish brown. The pupa possesses a triangular cremaster ending in two arms each of which is provided with a straight and a curved spines and possessing a pair of dorso-lateral spines near the base. The key is proposed for the distinction of Japanese Rhagastis pupae. Proximal area of maxilla slightly protruded ventrad and cephalad ; extreme of antenna just beyond tip of mesothoracic leg; spiracular furrow on 5th-6th abdominal segments ; cremaster triangular, ending in two arms each of which is provided with a stright and a curved spines, and possessing a pair of dorso-lateral spines near the base trilineata Matsumura Proximal area of maxilla not so protruded ventrad and cephalad as the precedings ; extreme of antenna reaching tip of mesothoracic leg; spiracular furrow on 5th-7th abdominal segments ; cremaster wedge-like, ending in two arms each of which is provided with two curved spines, and never possessing dorsolateral spines. mongoliana Butler.

N2  - In this paper, a new species of the genus Sais, belonging to the Ithomiinae, is described. Fox (1967) recognized only one species in this genus, Sais rosalia (Cramer), in his monograph (Part 3). The author participated in the expedition "La Expedicion Japonesa a las Zonas Amazonicas, 1973", organized by an explorative association "Congreso Andinista del Japon" and the Kyodo Press, and collected three males of an unknown Ithomiid butterfly in the tropical rain forest near Mitu, Vaupes, Colombia. The colour pattern of this species is very similar to that of Napeogenes inachia johnsoni Fox & Real, but it is to be treated as a new and the second species of the genus Sais by investigating the venation and the male genitalia. The author wishes to express his cordial thanks to Dr. K. S. Brown (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Sb Paulo), who gave the author valuable suggestions and offered him to describe this new species. Many thanks are also due to Mr. T. G. Howarth (retired from the British Museum- Natural History, London) and Dr. P. R. Ackery (British Museum-Natural History, London), who gave the author kind advices for investigation. Furthermore, the author is very grateful to Dr. Yoshihiko Kurosawa (National Science Museum, Tokyo), who offered him many conveniences for investigation and accepted to preserve the holotype in the museum in Tokyo above mentioned.

N2  - The Oriental Clouded Yellow Colias erate poliographus Motschulsky (Pieridae) is widely distributed in the East Asia and is one of the most abundant butterflies in Japan. The adults apparently prefer open areas. The larvae eat some species of leguminous plants that include introduced plants. They are quite commonly found on clovers, which are introduced plants. It seems that, before man commenced cultivation, this butterfly inhabited much more restricted open areas than at the present time and fed on native legumes. So, this insect must have extended its habitation and food range in consequence of man's activity. This study was made on purpose to know its original host plants, and the larvae were reared on various native legumes as well as on white clover in laboratory. Field observations were also made to support the laboratory study. Among native legumes twelve species belonging to eight genera were used in rearing. Two of them, bean thermopsis Thermopsis lupinoides and bird's tare Vicia cracca, proved to be suitable for food plants and in no way inferior to white clover. On other five species, the results were far from satisfactory on the further five species, all larvae died in the first instar or in middle instars. The mean durations of larval and pupal periods were shorter and the mean pupal weight was greater on the suitable plants than on the unsuitable plants, and the width of head capsule was also found to differ between the larvae on these plant groups. Not a few larvae on the unsuitable plants had six or seven instars, whereas the normal instar number is five. The growth of larval head capsule was discussed. In the field the females did not necessarily oviposite on suitable plants alone. However, the laboratory study shows that the host plants of this butterfly are restricted to a few species of the leguminous plants. Vicia cracca and Therm opsis lupinoides would have been its main host plants under the pre-exploitation condition in Hokkaido.

N2  - The placida group of the genus Aletia Hubner is defined by the genitalic characters to place A. placida (Butler, 1878) and its two new allies, A. subplacida sp. nov. from Taiwan and A. bani sp. nov. from Japan, which are described here. The genus Aletia Hubner, [1821], as redefined by Franclemont (1951) and later more extensively discussed by Carola (1966), is the largest assemblage of the Old World Mythimna-Leucania complex. The genus is fairly discriminated in having the developed diffuse corona on the cucullus of male genitalia and represents a natural unit, but there are possibilities to divide it further into moderately sized species groups, mainly on the basis of more detailed features of male and female genitalia. The nature of the inner sac of male aedeagus and its armature will be one of the most useful primary characters.

N2  - Salatura genutia (the Common Tiger) occurs from Afghanistan, whole of India, Sri Lanka, through the Malay Archipelago to Australia. Northeastwards it reaches the southern extremity of the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan. Although generally distributed and very common throughout the habitats, it is local and little has so far been known about the food plants. Nine genera and eleven species of Asclepiadaceae have been hitherto recorded from India, Maly Peninsula, Formosa and Japan. In this report, Cynanchum liukiuensis is described as a food plant in Iriomote Island, Okinawa Pref., (the southernmost island of the Ryukyus), with a brief note of ovipositing behaviour of the maternal butterfly.

N2  - Tsushima, a group of rocky islands in Nagasaki prefecture, Japan, is situated in the strait separating the Korean Peninsula and Japan. It rouses our particular interest in the zoogeographical subject. Neptis philyra (Nymphalidae) occurs in the Far East, especially in the districts surrounding the Japan Sea. A female was captured from Tsushima by the author. This is the second record from there. It is possible to distinguish it from ssp.philyra occurring in Korea and also from ssp. exceflens in Japan main islands, because of the better developed white spots on both surfaces. Pieris melete (Pieridae) is also distributed in the Far East. In 1910, Fruhstorfer described a new subspecies, ssp. juba, from Tsushima, but it is considered at present that he erroneously treated P. canidia, commonly found there, as P. melete. Since the first discovery of P. inelete in 1954, only ten individuals have so far been reported. In this report, the eleventh example is recorded and all of the records hitherto reported are reviewed.

N2  - The present paper represents a part of taxonomic study of Japanese geometrid larvae. In this paper the author described the mature larvae of all the species of the genera Myrteta Walker and Scionomia Warren, occurring in Japan. The terminology for the setae is Hinton's (1946) system setae of anal proleg and anal shield are named according to Dugdale (1961). The additional subprimary lateral seta, commonly found on the first seven abdominal segments, is called "seta L4" according to Dugdale (1961). The thoracic and abdominal segments are referred to by the abbreviations T and A, respectively. Most characters common to the larvae of this subfamily have been omitted. Many specific differences can be found in larval characters and habits. The absence of seta 5V3 on Al to A5 or the presence of an additional seta on each side of anal shield is a useful character which serves to distinguish this genus from most genera of this subfamily. Ventral proleg of A6 with 4 external setae ; 2 setae in the first instar larva. Mesoseries of crochets complete in the first instar larva, and varied depending on the species in the last instar larva. Angelica is a leaf-webber, and the other species are not concealed feeders. Angelica and sericea pupate in the soil, and tinagmaria and punctata in a thin cocoon among the leaves. The hibernating stage is presumably the egg or the early instar larva in angelica, and the pupa in the other species. Angelica feeding on Styrax (Styracaceae), sericea and tinagmaria on Camellia and Stewartia (Theaceae) and punctata on Acer (Aceraceae).

In this paper, Papilionidae collected at Ambon Island are reported, in which reference is made to: 1) one of the endemic characters of P. aiphenor which possibly makes P. aiphenor distinguishable from true P. polytes as an independent species distributed in Philippine and Moluccas. 2) re-examination on three forms of P. fuscus fuscus Goeze described by Jordan (1908). 3) continuous color variation observed on wings of female G. macfarlanei cestius Fruhstorfer. 4) an aberrant form of G. sarpedon anthedon Felder.

N2  - The genus Hypena Schrank, a large homogeneous group of the world-wide distribution, contains a number of species of subtropical origin. Most of these species appear to show considerable variations in forewing pattern subject to seasonal conditions. Four species dealt with in this paper fall into this category ; the moths appearing in June to August are much stable in pattern with scarce difference between the sexes, but those in autumn are more or less variable than the summer form especially in the female. The latter often looks much faded after overwintering. Correct identification to the difficult complexes of this genus would be secured by giving light on these points of view. Hypena indicatalis Walker, 1858 =Hypena caliginosa Wileman, 1911. Syn. nov. The female has the antemedian line oblique to before postmedian line and acutely angled at vein 1, which in the hibernal form markedly defined with pale to form a large median triangular patch (Fig. 11, 12). In my collection there is a darkest female specimen (Fig. 13) fairly agreeing with the holotype of caliginosa Wileman (Fig. 2). This rare form is to appear in the hibernal generation. Caliginosa Wileman is a synonym of indicatalis. Common in the southern coastal to south-western regions of Japan. Larva feeds on Boehmeria. Elypena occata Moore, 1882 =Hypena hampsonialis Wileman, 1911. Syn. nov. The ground colour of forewing varies in the hibernal form from pale ochreous yellow to dark bluish grey; the blackish mark below apex in cellules 5 and 6 are often reduced or vestigial (Fig. 16, 17). Common in the southern coastal to south-western regions of Japan. Larva also feeds on Boehmeria, frequently found mixed with that of the preceding species (Yamamoto, 1965). Hypena innocua Wileman et West, 1930. The male antenna bears ciliation much longer than the two preceding species ; the shape of forewing is almost similar to occata. In the hibernal form the black dots in and at end of cell more prominent; the subterminal series of blackish dots and dark oblique stria below apex in cellule 6 are clearly marked (Fig. 18, 19). In one male (Fig. 21) the forewing is strongly irrorated with fuscous, and another female (Fig. 22) has a large medial triangular patch. This last appears to be the same as described as Hypena triangularis Moore, 1882, from Khasia Hill and then it take precedence to innocua Wileman et West, but I am premature to conclude this synonymy. Not uncommon in nearly same region of Japan as occata. Lavra unknown. Hypena sinuosa Wileman, 1911. The male antenna is as in the preceding species. In this species the sinuous postmedian line is distinctive. The dark shade before it is variable, often reduced into two spots at end of cell and at vein 2 (Fig. 26) or completely obsolete (Fig. 23, 24). Wileman's type series are from Kagoshima, Kyushu, but the materials I have examined come from Yakushima I., Tanegashima I., Ishigaki I. and Taiwan. Two overwintering females collected on Ishigaki I. are markedly tinged with red brown, one of which is ornamented with double irregular series of dots before subterminal line of forewing (Fig. 27). Larva unknown. Hypena furva Wileman, 1911. This species is not represented in my and other available collections. The holotype specimen (Fig. 6) is a male collected at Kagoshima.

N2  - Female butterflies of Ornithoptera pria;nus urvilijana Guerin-Meneville, bred from pupae imported from Bougainville, were released in a garden at Sogeri, Papua New Guinea (9°25'S, 147°25'E) where O.p,. poseidon Doubleday occurred in all its stages naturally. This resulted in many hybrids of both sexes. Later, in the same garden, adults of both sexes of Troides oblongomaculatus papuensis Wallace, obtained from pupae introduced from Lae (6°44'S, 147°00'E) were also released and after a small colony of this species had established itself several matings of both sexes of O.p. poseidon and T. oblongomaculatus Papuensis were observed and subsequently one male hybrid specimen was reared.

N2  - The larval characters of Mycalesis gotama amamiana Fujioka from Amami Island are very similar to those of the same subspecies from Okinawa Island, but are obviously distinguished from those of M. g. fulginia Fruhstorfer from the mainland of Japan or M. g. madjicosa Butler from Ishigaki Island. Results of crossing between the two subspecies, M. g. fulginia Fruhstorfer (♂) from Shizuoka Prefecture, the mainland of Japan, and M. g. amamiana Fujioka (♀) from Amami Island are followings: (1) a considerable number of the middle instar larvae hanged as a pre-pupa, which died without moulting ; (2) emerged adults were only males; (3) asymmetrical wing patterns were seen in most of the emerged ones. The facts suggest that amamiana is highly differentiated from fulginia as a subspecies by isolation of the Tokara Straits.

Both the species are endemic to the Sierra Nevada and characterize the butterfly fauna of that region. Furthermore, 14 species of the Pronophilini were collected by the expedition above mentioned, the data of which will be reported in a subsequent paper.

N2  - In 1974, the authors had a series of field observation on Catopsilia at Kagoshima Prefecture, and reared the eggs laid by two females of Catopsilia Pomona Fabricius and three of C. crocale Cramer. The following results were obtained. 1) Of three examples of mating observed in the natural conditions at Yamakawa-cho (Kagoshima Pref. ), two were pomona x crocale. 2) Three batches of mixed offspring composed of pomona and crocale emerged from a female of ppmon aand two females of crocale. A batch of mixed offspring was supposed to occur also in the field. 3) All offspring of an individual of pomona were crocale. 4) Hatchability of the third generation deriving from the two females of crocale of which materal butterfly may be a single female of pomona is so high as shown by 100 and 93%. These results suggest that pomona and crocale, hitherto regarded as the dependent species, are the different phenotypes of a single species.

N2  - The releaser for the feeding behavior, the mechanism of food-finding and the color preferences in flower-visiting in the adult of Nymphalis xanthomelas japonica Stichel were examined under quasi-natural conditions. Feeding behavior of the adult is released by the taste of food and/or the odor emanating from food itself or food-donors (flowers, for instance), but not by the color or the shape of food-donors. In searching for food, the adults stimulated by the odor of food or food-donors, find out food mainly by exercising olfactory sense and only with the supplemental aid of the gustatory chemoreceptor of the tarsus of legs or visible sense. Olfactory chemoreceptors, therefore, have an important function in the feeding behavior of this species. Although the adults hardly visit merely colored objects (scentless artificial flowers, for instance) nor are they prompted to try reaching the proboscis for food by such odorless matters, yet when the adfults come flying to scented and colored objects, colors of the objects also seem to be a clue of finding, and the adults readily find the objects if they are both scented and colored. But the color of food or a food-donor essentially exerts no influence on the feeding behavior. The adults, however, really have the color sense, and at least bluish and yellowish colors are discriminated out of others. In flower-visiting the adults display preferences not only on the odor but also on the color of flowers, and have a manifest liking to several colors: blue, yellow and white. In addition bluish color seems to be far preferred to the yellowish.

N2  - 1) Ovipositing in captivity was studied on some Lycaenid butterflies at Aomori Pref. in 1974 and 1975. The well-conditioned females of Neozephyrus sniaragdinus and Wagimo signata were alive over a ten-day period, and laid eggs 100 or more in captivity with a sleave covering the food-plants. 2) The natural history of W. signata in the district of Aomori is as follows: This species is essentially single-brooded and hibernates as an egg. July and August are the usual months for the butterfly. Both sexes of this butterfly are on the wing contemporaneously in early June. It is exceptional, as a member of the Japanese Theclini, in that the male-to-female ratio is 1:2 in the natural conditions as well as in breeding ones. They copulate during 4-6 P.M. from the end of July to early August. 3) Two forms, f. signata and f. quercivora, of W. signata inhabit in the same areas of Aomori district. Of sixteen copulations found in the fields, one was signata×quercivora. One female of signata, verified to have copulated with quercivora, laid 66 eggs in total. The hybrid offspring comprised 20 quercivora and 15 signata. They showed marked individual-variations in size, ranging from near-normal to excessively small.

N2  - Hypolimnas bolina is widely distributed in the tropical Asia. Not a few specimens have been recorded in Japan as one of the migratory butterflies. However, their progeny is unable to survive the winter there, although they may breed temporarily during the favourable summer in some year. The females are much more captured than the males, and are classified into the following four forms, each having its own distributional range which does not overlap each other: 1. Philippine form (subsp. philippensis Butler) - Over 50 specimens are recorded in Japan. 2. Formosan form (subsp. kezia Butler) - Over 50 specimens including butterflies produced from some immigrants are recorded in Japan. 3. Red spotted form (subsp. bolina Linnaeus or patauensis Fruhstorfer)- Over 20 specimens have been recorded in Japan since 1957. 4. Continental form (subsp. incommoda Butler) - Only 5 specimens are recorded in Japan. It was noteworthy that three forms, Philippine, Formosan and Continental, were collected together during such a short period as 18 days from Aug. 24 to Sept. 10, 1966, in Miyazaki, southeastern part of Kydshd. An investigation on the air-currents in the year 1966 suggests that the butterflies in question were conveyed up by the Typhoon 12 in the South-China Sea and successively transported into the Typhoon 15 which landed at Miyazaki-city on August 23, 1966. The present account is given on the rearing records of the offspring from the females captured in Miyazaki at that time, with the results summarized as follows: 1. Eggs obtained from Formosan form (e. g. No. A in Table 2) were hatched in a very high percentage and were produced the offspring with 1: 1 ratio of males to females which have the same maternal phenotype. Similar results are also obtained on Formosan form collected at the other place in Japan (unpublished). Some females, however, (e. g. No. C in Table 2) exceptionally produced F_1 offspring whose phenotype varied from intermediate between Formosan and Philippine forms to Formosan one. 2. The hatchabilities of larvae from 4 broods of Philippine form varied from 37 to 100%, while no larvae from other 3 broods of the form hatched at all. Similar data are also known on Philippine form collected in Japan. Although there is no detailed information, it is assumed that sterility of the eggs is due to scarcity of the males in the Philippines, the exodus site of the form concerned. 3. The offspring produced from 3 females of Philippine form were exclusively females closely resembling their mothers. The remaining one brood, however, produced offspring whose phenotype varied from Philippine to Formosan form, including intermediate of them; the parental mating occurred possibly between ♀ Philippine form and ♂ Formosan one at the place where they reached. 4. In Miyazaki-city, a few eggs were found on the leaves of sweet potato, Ipomoea edulis, in the field, but no F_1 butterflies developed in situ at all.

N2  - The chromosomes of Papilio machaon have been studied by several researchers with different results: Federley (1938) reported n, 30, 31, 32, and 33 for Finnish forms, Lorkovic (1941) gave n, 30 for Yugoslavian forms, Maeki (1953) found n, 31 for Japanese forms, and Maeki & Ae (1966) informed n, 30 for Himalayan forms. The present author reexamined the chromosome of Papilio machaon hippocrates collected in the following localities, namely, Sapporo, Obihiro, Otaru, Hakodate, Goshogawara, Hirosaki, Tokyo, Nagoya, Nishinomiya, Fukuoka, Saga, and Kagoshima. Counts of chromosomes were made as to 616 nuclei in the primary spermatocytes based on the testes taken from 36 males. The chromosome number of these specimens showed a chromosomal polymorphism in the primary spermatocytes, ranging from n, 30 to n, 34, as shown in figs. 3-11 and table 1. The most frequent number of n, 31 was observed in 52.1% of the cells. The next most frequent chromosome number was n, 30, seen in 23.4% of the total. Also n, 32-nuclei occurred in 20%, n, 33-nuclei in 3.9%, n, 34-nuclei in 0.6% of the 616 nuclei observed. The basic number of Papilio inachaon hippocrates seems to be 30. The cause of the numerical variation lies in the presence of the supernumerary chromosome. The supernumeraries vary from 1 to 4 in number and are derived from the fragmentation of chromosomes through the course of the first meiosis.

N2  - Pseudodoxia achlyphanes (Meyrick) was originally described from a single female specimen taken at Tokyo, Japan, as referable to the genus Ciyptolechia. It is common in Kinki district (Honsyu), but the immature stages of this species have not been recorded. I have recently found the larvae of the species feeding on the dead leaves of some deciduous plants, living in the long, narrow-conical cases. In this paper I wish to describe the morphological characters of the immature stages as well as of the adult. Having examined the genitalia, I have come to the conclusion that this species should be transferred from the genus Cyptolechia Zeller to Pseudodoxia Durrant. Before going further, I wish to express my hearty gratitude to Dr. S. Issiki, Professor Emeritus of University of Osaka Prefecture, for his guidance in my study. Thanks are also due to Dr. S. Moriuti, University of Osaka Prefecture, for reading the original manuscript.

N2  - The homoeotic aberration on the wing of a female of Orthosia angustipennis Matsumura (Noctuidae) is recorded. This example shows the forewing pattern mosaicly on the left hindwing and is also conspicuous in that this pattern is copied partly in the area between costai margin and vein M1. Hayashi (1961) pointed out that the forewing pattern is not copied in this area of hindwing due to the differences in the veins of radius and subcosta between fore and hindwings. It seems that the vein aberrant of the hindwing (the coalescence of traceae of radius and subcosta is imperfect and the short branches may be the residual parts of the coalescent radii, see fig. 4) is the result of copying the forewing pattern on the costal area in this case.

N2  - The sensitive stage of photoperiod and the thermal relations of development of the Actias Moths were investigated for Kanagawa stock in Japan. The sensitive period in the larval life of Actias artemis or Actias selene, during which photoperiod exerts their influence upon the incidence of the pupal diapause was last two larval stages, respectively. The threshold temperature and thermal constants for development of one generation were calculated from the regression of the velocity of development from the egg to adult emergence on temperature. A. artemis had threshold of 9.5℃, but A. selene showed somewhat higher value, 10℃. Variation in thermal constants showed the reversed tendency; A. artemis had value of about 1000 degree-days and A. selene about 800 degree-days in the non-diapause growth. This fact suggests that A. selene is more the pattern of northerly adaptation than A. artemis. These datas were superimposed on the photothermographs of different parts of Japan in order to predict the seasonal life cycles and the local adaptabilities of both species. The predicted life cycles of both species corn- formed well to field observation in Kanagawa district. It was suggested, however, that both species would require some genetic change for establishing in the northern parts of Honshu (at least in Aomori) or in Hokkaido or in the southern parts of Kyushu (at least in Kagoshirna). It needs to show sign of divergence in the photoperiod of these areas. Perhaps, in both species, the critical day length of the diapause-inducing photoperiod should be above 15 hours in the Aomori or the Hokkaido populations for being univoltine, on the other hand, below l3hr 30 minutes in the Kagoshirna or more southerly populations for being suffice to produce a third generation. While, the fact that A. selene is not distributed in Kyushu area may be mostly due to diaharmonization between the life cycle and the seasonal changes, and also a result of siow adaptation to local diversities of climatic condition.

The eggs are laid on the buds or underside of young leaves of Pithecellobium lucidum Benth. (Leguminosae), with fifty-three or seventy-two in a cluster. The 1st and 2nd instar larvae led gregarious life, but I could not observe whether the larvae form aggregations lasting until pupation or not. Pupae hang themselves up in rows along the underside of twigs and leaf-stalks of food plant in nature.

In the larval description the nomenclature used for the setae is that of Hinton (1946), except that a seta on the first seven abdominal segments is called L4 (according to Dugdale, 1961, and agreeing with lambda of Fracker, 1915). Individual segments of thorax and abdomen are briefly referred to as T1 to T3 and A1 to A10 respectively.

N2  - The genus Ancea is distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. Comstock (1961) subdivided this genus into 8 subgenera, such as Coenophlebia, Siderone, Zaretis, Hypna, Anaea, Memphis, Consul and Po(ygrapha, and recognized 121 species. The author reports here the data and some notes on 5 species of the genus Anaea, which were collected and observed in the Santa Marta Mountains, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the Magdalena department, northern Colombia, by the 1st Scientific Expedition of Shizuoka University to the Colombian Andes, 1967. The classification of those species is due to Comstock (1961). The author thanks the late Mr. Taro Iwase and Dr. Koroku Negishi for offering him conveniences of investigating literature, and also Dr. Ryflichi Tsuehi and Mr. Takeshi Sugimoto for helping him through the butterfly survey in the expedition.

N2  - The role of photoperiod as a factor involved in the induction of larval diapause and the occurrence of diapausing form in Sasakia charonda Hewitson was studied. It was proved that this species is not an inherently univoltine but an multivoltine one and that a factor determining the voltinism is photoperiodic conditions in the larval period. Larvae submitted to photophases longer than 14 hours, became non-diapausing and produced the second generation, hence, this species is one of the butterflies with a 'long-day type' development. Under room-temperature condition critical day-lengths for inducing larval diapause and producing diapausing form at fourth or fifth instar were estimated around 13 hr. and 45 mm., and 14 hr., respectively. The occurrence of diapausing form, however, is not directly connected with diapause itself and diapasuing form is easily eliminated on treatment of long-day photoperiod. These phenomena allow the conception of pre-diapause and real diapause stage and are assumed to be of great ecological significance. On the other hand, browning of body colour, which may also be due to photoperiodic reaction, must be considered to be closely bound up with diapause since the larvae in non-diapausing form even change body colour before wintering. From the present data, it follows that the larvae should hibernate in the stage of fourth or fifth instar in the greater part of the habitat and that hibernation in the third instar is to be restricted only in, probably, cold regions.

N2  - Some differences are found in shape, colouration and food-plant of the larvae between Mycalesis gotama madjicosa Butler, occurring in the Ryukyus, and M. g. fulginia Fruhstorfer, ranging from Hokkaido to Kyushu (including Yaku Island). The larvae of madjicosa (which were collected from Ishigaki Island), as compared with those of fulginia, are as follows: in 2nd instar larva body with very conspicuous white longitudinal streaks on subdorsal and lateral areas, in all stages larval head with wholly black frontal side, and in 3rd-final (5th) instar larvae head with a pair of horns very prominent and much tapered, especially in final instar. Differences in pupae between the two subspecies are not so distinct as in larvae. In my rearings, the larva of madjicosa feeds on Miscanthus sinensis Andersson and Phyllostachys nigra (Loddiges) Munro var. Henonis (Bean) Stapf, which are suggested to be fit as food-plants for this subspecies (from Ishigaki Island), and does not feed on Poa annua Linnaeus, while that of fulginia feeds on it.

During our short stay in Sabah, we could capture many males and females of this butterfly at Papar, Ranau and Poring on December 26th 1972 to January 10th 1973. Some ecological notes on C. scylla in Sabah (e.g., abundance, habitat, adult behavior) are given in this paper. We are interested especially in that this species seems to be rapidly increasing in population, considered together with the question of adult migration. The problems of the subspecific status and the seasonal form of C. scylla in Sabah are still under consideration.

N2  - A tooth is present on the first axillary scierite of the fore wing base in almost all the species of Saturniidae in Japan and Formosa. The Actias group has a strong, hook-shaped tooth. The tooth is similar to those of Antheraea yamamai Guerin-Meneville, Philosamia cynthia pryeri Butler and Attacus atlas Linnacus. Caligula boisduvalii jonasii Butler, Loepa katinka formosensis Mell, Dictyoploca japonica Moore and Rhodinia jankowskii hattoriae Oberthur have a small tooth. Such a tooth does not occur in Rhodinia fugax Butler and Aglia tan microtau Inoue. The shapes of the first axillary sclerite and its tooth appear to be often a reliable generic character. However, Rhodinia fugax fugax differs distinctly from R. jankowskii hattoriae in feature, though the two species have been treated as being congeneric; in this case, the feature may represent their different evolutionary level. The function of the tooth was observed on the adult emergence of Japanese Actias selene gnoma Butler. When the adult emerges, it bumps repeatedly the head against the dorsal side of head skin. On this movement, the pupal skin is torn along the dorsao-meson of vertex and thorax; the tooth being inserted in a hollow on the pupal prothoracic skin serves as a hook causing the head to be lifted. When the adult gets into trouble on the emergence on account hard pupal skin, the tooth tears up the head or wing skin into pieces.

N2  - A.S. Corbet published a key for the separation of the Indo-Australian and African species of the genus Euploea Fabricius in 1943. He dealt with all the known Euploea species except two species in the keyS and furnished a foundation for the classification of this taxonomically difficult genus. Euploea blossomae Schaus, 1929, is one of the two species which were not included in Corbet's key, due to the fact that its affinities could not be recognized from the original description. Recently I had a chance to examine a single female from Luzon, Philippines, and also an unique pair from Palawan, Philippines, both belonging to this Euploea species. The female of Euploea blocsomae is described for the first time, this species is newly recorded from Palawan and the Palawan race is described as a new subspecies. In compiling this paper I tender my warmest thanks to Messrs. Y. Honda and K. Unno for providing me with the specimens of this very rare species, which they captured in Palawan and Luzon respectively. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Lt. Col. J. N. Eliot, Somerset, for his kind information on this Euploea species. To Messrs. T. G. Howarth and R. I. Vane-Wright, British Museum (Natural History), I am indebted for their kind informations on the type specimen of Euploea blossomae and for their advices.

N2  - A Papilionid butterfly Graphium sarpedon nipponum Fruhstorfer is commonly found in the Pacific coast of Central Japan and southward. Larvae thrive on Lauraceous plants, such as Cinnamomum Camphora Sieb., C. Loureirii Nees, C. japonicum Sieb., Litsea aciculata Blume, L. glauca Sieb., and Machilum Thunbergii Sieb. et Zucc. In Central Japan, two generations are usually repeated per year, and overwintering is done at the pupal stage. Adults of the first brood (vernal form) appear in April-June and those of the second brood (aestival form) in July-August. This life cycle, however, is not always constant. Adults of the next brood are found quite often within the year. The present writers have carried out an individual rearing experiment of the materials collected in the summer of 1973. This short report deals with the growth of the head capsule in the successive instars of these larvae.

These are: one Hesperiid, Borbo cinnara Wallace (fig. 2); one Lycaenid, Deudorix eryx Linnaeus (fig. 6); two Danaids, Idea leuconoe Erichson (fig. 10) and Panlymnas chrysippus Linnaeus (fig. 4); and two Nymphalids, Cyrestis thpodamas Boisduval (fig. 7) and Precis almana Linnaeus (fig. 9).

N2  - There are two distinct seasonal forms, the summer and autumn ones, in both Eurema hecabe mandarina de l'Orza and Eurema laeta bethesba Janson. The two species hibernate only in the adult stage of the autumn form. Experiments were carried out to elucidate the critical day-length for determination of the seasonal form and to compare ovarian development and longevity of the different seasonal forms by using materials collected in northern parts of Kyushu. The larvae and pupae were reared at a temperature of 25±1℃ and photoperiods of 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 hours per day. The result shows that there are distinct differences in the photoperiodic response between the two species, although both showed "long-day type" photoperiodie responses. The critical photoperiod seems to lie between 13 and 14 hours in Eurema laeta bethesba, but it is obscure in Eureina hecabe mandarina in which the autumn form was less than 40 per cent even in 11-hour photoperiod (fig. 9). The ovary of Eurema laeta bethesba (25±1℃ and 15 +3℃) matured on the fourth day after emergence independently of temperature in the summer form, while it developed very slowly especially at the low temperature in the autumn form. On the contrary, there was no detectable difference in ovarian development between the summer and autumn forms in Eurema hecabe mandarina. In both species there was little difference in adult longevity between the autumn and summer forms at 25±1℃, while at 15±3℃, the autumn form survived much longer than the summer form (fig. 11). The seasonal succession of the different forms in the field can be explained by the day-length during the larval stage. Although the occurrence of seasonal forms in Eurema hecabe mandarina is affected by the photoperiod during the larval development, temperature seems also to exert some influence.

N2  - Surprising is the devlopment of the genus Athyma Westwood (Nymphalidae) in the small island of Palawan, where we could recognise nine distinct species and more than half of them are endemic to the island and the neighbouring Balabac Island. We describe an unique race of Athyma asura from Palawan Island. The species is distributed from Himalaya to south China and southwards to the Malaysian subregion, but has not hitherto been found in Palawan Island.

N2  - The Thyrididae are a small family and 13 species belonging to seven genera have only been recorded from Japan. This paper deals with the classification of the pupae of eight species belonging to five genera of Thyrididae. Only Herdooics is very different from the others in this family not only in the larvae (Mutuura, 1958) but also in the pupae; however, it is considered that this genus is somewhat correlatical to most of Thyridid-genera. The pupae of Thyrididae excluding Herdooia are allied to those of Pyraustidae, especially in Epipasehiinae and Pyralinae, but are easily distinguishable from them by the forewing extending to the 5th abdominal segment. On the other hand, Herdonia is similar to Alucitidae and Pyraustid Schoenobiinae but is distinguished from Alucitidae in that the forewing extends to the 4th abdominal segment and the prothoracic leg is longer than the maxilla, and from Sehoenobiinae in that the labial palpus is wanted, the prothoracie coxa and troehanter never meet on the meson and the 8th abdominal spiraele is situated more dorsad. Moreover, it is very characteristic of Thyrididae that the appendix of prothoracic spiracle is present in some genera. The author is obliged to Messrs. Toshihisa Saito, Osaka, and Rikio Sato, Niigata, for the offering of the specimens.

The wings of the normal specimen are white in general appearance. However, this aberrant specimen differs from the normal one as follows: forewing grey, with the inner line preceded by a distinct white band, with the outer line followed by a similar band, and with a distinct white marginal line; hindwing with a grey submarginal area, slightly mixed with blackish-fuscous scales.

N2  - InJuly 1973, Messrs. S. Murayama and H. Okamura reported jointly on the Philippine butterflies collected by them. But, in their work, several species were found erroneously determined, particularly in such families as Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae, hence the present paper. Before going further, I express my sincere gratitude to Prof. T. Shirozu for his kindness in giving me facilities to examine the literature concerned, and also to Mr. H. Hayashi who, in compliance with my request, had inspected some type-specimens kept in the British Museum (Natural History), London.

N2  - This study is mainly based on the collection made by Mr. Yasuzo Honda during his stay in Palawan Island as a member of the Kawansei Gakuin University Academic Exploration Party to Palawan Island in 1967-1969. The six Eurema species dealt with in this paper all belong to the hecabe group. Both sexes of the butterflies and thier male genitalia are figured, and some important characters of them are described in detail. Of six species, two, simulatrix and andersoni, are now recorded for the first time as occurring in the island, and one, alitha, which has hitherto been treated as a subspecies of hecabe in Palawan, is recognised as a good species; three subspecies are described as new. Eurema ada prabha (Fruhstorfer) is not available for the present study, thought it is known to occur in the island. In compiling this paper I tender my warmest thanks to Mr. Yasuzo Honda for submitting the material to me and for his information on the Palawan butterflies. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Dr. Takashi Shirozu, Kyushu University, for his constant guidance and valuable advice. To Messrs. Renji Wada and Toyoho Nishida, I am indebted for the material from various parts of the Philippines. Finally I acknowledge my deepest thanks to Messrs. Yoshinobu Uemura and Syuji Tachikawa, Tokyo University of Agriculture, for taking photographs of the male genitalia.

N2  - The Morphidae are the family found in the Neotropical Region, and include only one genus Morpho. Fruhstorfer (1924) recognized 2 subgenera and 30 species within the genus. After that, le Moult (1962) subdivided the genus into 8 subgenera and recognized 80 species, but there are some questions in his classification. The author reports the data and some ecological notes on 2 species of the genus Morpho, which were collected and observed by the 1st Scientific Expedition of Shizuoka University to the Colombian Andes, 1967. These specimens have been preserved in the Fuculty of Science, Shizuoka University, except for 1 specimen of Morpho rhodopteron rhodopteron Godaman & Salvin in the National Museum of Science, Tokyo. The author thanks the late Taro Iwase, Dr. Koroku Negishi, and Mr. Mono Wakabayashi, for offering him conveniences of investigating literature. Acknowledgements are also due to the kindness of Dr. Ryuichi Tsuchi and Mr. Takeshi Sugimoto who helped him through the butterfly survey in that expedition, and to Mr. Horst Muller who offered a valuable specimen of Morpho rhodopteron schultzei le Moult for the butterfly collection of Shizuoka University.

N2  - On February 16, 1973, the author had a chance to examine some specimens of Princeps demoleus collected by Mrs. Faustino at Mansalay, a small village in southeast Mindoro Island, the Philippines. According to Hiura (1973) this species was also collected by Mr. Honda in July, 1971, in Mindoro. The author has also recorded this species in the present paper from Zamboanga City, Mindanao Island. This butterfly was flying from flower to flower at Pasonanca Park of the city on February 13, 1972. Ae (1970) already reported the species from Mindanao Island, but he did not describe the detail of the collecting place in the island. Hiura (1973) recorded the butterfly from Bugusuk and Balabac Islands based on the collection of Mr. Honda inJuly, 1971. Thus, Princeps demolens has been recorded in Luzon, Mindoro. Palawan, Bugusuk, Balabac, Leyte, Cebu, Negros and Mindanao Islands, but the present author has not seen any record of the butterfly from Masbate, Panay, Samar and Bohol Islands. He has shown a distirbution map of P. demoleus libanius Fruhstorfer in the Philippines in fig. I, except the records of Negros and Mindanao reported by Ae (1970), because his collecting places in these islands were not recorded. A distribution map of this butterfly in East Asia is shown in fig. 2, which is modified after Shirozu (1960). The author has an interest when Princeps demoleus will invade Borneo Island through the Philippine Archipelago. There are two possible courses for this butterfly to invade Borneo; one is the course of Zamboanga-Sulu-Borneo, and the other Palawan-Bugusuk-Balabac-Borneo.

N2  - Towards the end of March in 1968 the author visited North Thailand to collect butterflies. It was in the midst of dry season. Most leaves turned yellow and trees shed their leaves as they do in autumn in his country, and so it was difficult to find a suitable site for collecting butterflies. The author could not gather many because of the short-term expedition there. In this report the author deals with Lycaenidae only. All of the specimens were captured by himself, hence the author left out the name of the collection in the following description. The places were as follows: Chom Thong, Mt. Huay Khao, Fang and near the border of Burma. Before going further, the author wishes to express his hearty thanks to Mr. T. G. Howarth, Mr. C. F. Huggins and the other staff of the British Museum (Natural History), Mr. Akito Kawazoe and Mr. Syoichi Iwanaga who gave kind advices and facilities for investigation.

Whalley, to whem I am much indebted for allowing me to examine them in the collection of the British Museum (Natural History). The two species are the type-species of the genera and occur in India. Close examination of the specimens of the two revealed that the genus Psychromnestra Meyrick is closely related to Ypsolophus Fabricius and its allies, and that the genus Macrophanta Mayrick falls as a synonym of Swammerdamia Hubner.

N2  - 20. Kiriakoff (1968) erroneously designated that Ceira horishana Matsumura is synonymous with Ceira virgata Wileman, but horishana Matsumura is only the male of Pydna magma Matsumura (the latter is not a member of the genus Periergos, though Kiriakoff (1968) placed it in that genus). Ceira virgata Wileman supersedes Pydna formosicola Strand and should be placed in the genus Achepidna Matsumura. Bireta formosicola Starnd sensu Kiriakoff (1962) is probably a synonym of Ceira? sordida Roepke from Java. Togarishachia argentopicta Matsumura, which was described from the only one female, is congeneric with Poncetia albistriga kanshireiensis Wileman. Therefore, the genus Poncetia Kiriakoff should be sunken as a synonym of Togarishachia Matsumura. In the light of the above-mentioned results, rearrangement of Formosan Ceira-group gives 10 species. Besides them, a new species Torigea formosana Nakamura is added, and two already described species., Mimopydna sikkima Moore and Besaia (Curuzza) frugalis Leech, are recorded from Formosa for the first time. Curuzza Kiriakoff seems to be a subgenus of Besaia Walker. 21. According to my investigation, the Formosan Fentonia contains four species, namely, baibarana Matsumura, crenulata Matsumura, parabolica Matsumura and macroparabolica new species. Of these species, baibarana was misidentified by me as crenulata in the previous paper of this series (Nakamura, 1965), and parabolica is a good species, though Kiriakoff (1968) considered that the species is a synonym of ocypete Bremer. A detailed account is given of the differentiation among ocvpete, baibarana and crenulata. 22. A Formosan species of the genus Damata has been recorded under the name of longipennis f. formosicola Matsumura (1931) and recently been treated by Kiriakoff (1968) as a subspecies of longipennis. However, based on the result of a detailed comparison between Formosan and Indian representatives, it is evident that formosicola is a distinct species. Damata formosicola Matsumura is redescribed in detail. 23. Disparia wilemani Matsumura is neither a synonym nor a subspecies of variegata Wileman (= sordida ab. formosana Wileman), and is congeneric with nigrofasciata Wileman; the latter species is not identical with seriatopunctata Matsumura, as treated by Kiriakoff (1968). The Japanese variegata japonensis Tams is more slightly related to nigrofasciata than to variegata variegata, but an aestival form of variegata japonensis, which abnormally appears in the summer in Japan, is closely allied to variegata variegata. A new species Pseudofentonia (Disparia) medioalbida Nakamura, which seems to resemble "Calyptronotum" singapura Gaede in the wing pattern but is closely related to Pseudofentonia (Disparia) nigrofasciata 'Wileman in the male genitalia, is described.

N2  - In this paper the author has recorded 32 species of butterflies from Batan Island collected by him in August, 1970. As far as the butterfly is concerned, the fauna of this island consists of Formosan and Philippine forms. This fact suggests the goelogical relation between Batan Island and the two regions and this shows one of the evidences that Luzon and Formosa were connected by a land bridge in ancient times.

N2  - In 1972, during eight days, in early April, we made a short hunting trip to Luzon Island in Philippines. We collected six different places, namely, Mt. Santo Thomas (ca. 2250 m), Ashin Hot Spring (ca. 300 m), the Botanical Garden in the Bureau of Forestry at Baguio (ca. 1500 m), Tagaytay (ca. 1000 m), the Quezon National Park at Atimonan (ca. 300 m), and the lowland near Manila. In the spring of 1971, one of us (H.O.) also visited Luzon Island, and collected during only a few days in Mt. Santo Thomas, Ashin, and Tagaytay. The following list of the Luzonian butterflies in early April contains the butterflies collected as well as those only observed (the latter being marked with an asterisk), enumerating 129 species, of which two species and seven subspecies are new to science. We are much indebted to Mr. Hermel Nuyda and his son Mr. Robert Nuyda for supplying us with many precious materials and for their kind advice. Sincere thanks are due to Prof. Dr. Takashi Shirozu for giving me a copy of Semper's work. We wish to express our cordial gratitude to Mr. Peping Pascual for accompanying us on collecting trips. Further, Prof. Dr. Michiko Hida and her staff in the Botanical Laboratory of the Osaka Prefectural Women's University have kindly permitted us to use the equipments for our microscopic examination.

N2  - Diurnal behaviour of the 3rd-5th instar larvae of Neope goschkevitschii and N. niphonica was observed under the indoor condition. The larva of Neope niphonica is usually found on the leaf of its food plant and feeds in the night. In the nearly morning it descends from the food plant, and conceals itself among the fallen leaves in the daytime. The rhythm of diurnal behaviour-on the leaf in the night, and among the fallen leaves in the daytime-is considerably regular in this species. On the other hand, the larva of N. goschkevitschii feeds its food plant in the night as well as that of N. niphonica, but does not always descend from the food plant in the morning, and the diurnal rhythm is less regular than in N. niphonica.

N2  - In June, 1963, the author took part in the Lepidopterological Research Expedition to Nepal Himalaya, and collected various lepidoptera in the neighbourhood of Kathmandu, capital of Nepal. A Lycaenid butterfly resulting from larvae collected there and then turned out to be a hitherto unknown species, which the author would like to describe here as a new species with coloured illustration of the imago and early stages. The author is greatly indebted to Mr. T. G. HOWARTH, B.E.M., F.R.E.S., F.Z.S., the Department of Entomology, British Museum (Nat. Hist.) for his extreme kindnesses and advice extended to the author in the preparation of this paper.

Last but not least, the author would like to express his thanks to Dr. HIROSHI HARA, Professor Emeritus of Tokyo University, who kindly identified the larval foodplant of the butterfly. The specific name is dedicated to Mr. MOTOHIRO HARADA, an L. S. J. member who has co-operated with the author during several expeditions to Nepal and elsewhere, and collected numerous valuable insects.

N2  - Maculinea teleius shows very marked local and individual variation, and six subspecies have been hitherto described from Japan. In this report a new subspecies, hosonoi of M. teleius is described. The habitats of this subspecies are light and wet meadows at altitudes of 1600-2000m in Central Japan, but very local and scarce, known from only a few localities. This subspecies represents the minimum development in size. It resembles the brownish form, ssp. kazamoto of moderate elevation, but the latter is larger, uppersides are more heavily suffused blackish brown, and undersides strongly ocellate. The larval food plants of the new subspecies are Sanguisorba hakusanensis and S. officinalis (Rosaceae); the former has never been recorded as a larval food-plant, the latter is known as the sole one in the Western Japan. Generally speaking, blue races of the genus Maculinea occur at low or moderate altitudes, while dark forms at higher levels in alpine region. Variation in the extent of dark suffusion is, however, clinal as to M. teleius in Japan.

N2  - In the present paper, the author reported the rediscovery of Salatura yuchingkini MURAYAMA & SHIMONOYA, 1960, from Ishigaki-jima of the Loo-choos. In the present author's view, this curious butterfly should be regarded as a hybrid between Panlymnas chrysippus L. and Salatura genutia CR. In the same way, Gonepteryx amintha meiyuanus MURAYAMA & SHIMONOYA, 1962, described from Meiyu, central Formosa, may be a hybrid between G. a. formosana FRUHSTORFER and G. mahaguru taiwana PARAVICINI. Euploea godartii garampiana MURAYAMA & SHIMONOYA, 1960, described from southern Formosa is nothing but a migrant of E. core godartii LUCAS, which is a common species in southern Indochina and Thailand. Doleschallia bisaltide koshunensis MURAYAMA & SHIMONOYA, 1962, is also none but an example of D. b. philippensis FRUHSTORFER migrated from the Philippines to Formosa. Moreover, Appias celestina kabiraensis MURAYAMA, 1970, described from Ishigaki-jima of the Loo-choos is a migrant of A. marina SEMPER from the Philippines, as was already pointed out by T. SHIMONOYA in 1971.

N2  - Papilio benguetana was described as a new species by J. J. JOICEY and G. TALBOT in 1923 (The Entomologist, Vol.56), but all the known specimens collected since had been males. In May 1965, the author visited Pauai, Luzon, the Philippines, with Mr. MOTOHIRO HARADA. A total of twenty specimens were collected by us, including a fresh, flawless female taken by Mr. HARADA. We were faced with a choice-whether the butterfly should be made into a set specimen, or kept alive for breeding purposes. The latter being our decision, the butterfly, which was a virgin female, was mated by hand with a male insect ; unfortunately, the female would not lay any eggs despite all our efforts to induce its oviposition in captivity. The wreck of the butterfly died without progeny. In 1971, Mr. YOSHIAKI GUNJI went to the same place and was fortunate to net two perfect female specimens, which were subsequently placed at my disposal. In writing this paper, the author would like to thank Mr. HARADA and Mr. GUNJI for their devoted assistance and co-operation extended to him, and to congratulate them on their capture of these rare insects. The author is also indebted to Dr. TAKASHI SHIROZU, Professor of Kyushu University, and to Dr. YOSHIHIKO KUROSAWA of the National Science Museum, Tokyo, for their kind advice and suggestions.

N2  - The distribution, food-plant and early stages of Schistomitra funeralis BUTLER are discussed here in some detail. This species is an isolated diurnal moth endemic to Japan, and is standing now as an outlier of the Epiplemidae. The food-plant on which I found larvae is Stewartia pseudo-camellia MAXIM. (Theaceae). The larva is naked, but when alive densely covered with white waxy secretion like that of Psychostrophia (on Clethra) and Epicopeia (on Corpus). The moths fly in May to June. This species is distributed in somewhat limited areas of the interior mountains of central to western Honshu and also in an isolated habitat in Shikoku.

N2  - The author published "A list of Bornean butterflies, chiefly taken in Sarawak" (TYO TO GA, 19(3-4),1968), in which he recorded Precis hedonia from Northwestern Borneo as belonging to the subspecies ida CRAMER, But, afterwards, he studied more materials of the species collected from the various areas of Southeast Asia including Singapore, Java, Luzon, Mindanao, Palawan and Palau, and consequently, he has regarded the Precis hedonia from Northwestern Borneo as a distinct new subspecies which differs from ida in the following respects. In writing this paper, the author wishes to express his sincere thanks to Mr. Kazuhiko Morishita, Mr. Yutaka Arita, Mr. Yoshiaki Nishikawa, Mr. Yasuzo Honda and Mr. Syoichi Iwanaga who lent him their valuable specimens.

N2  - Danaus chrysippus, known as Plain Tiger, is a permanent resident in the subtropical or tropical Asia and appears to be resident in Formosa. It sometimes finds its way to Japan, but has never been found from N. Japan. D. chrysippus was first recorded in Japan in September of 1930. At Chiba Pref., a large number of examples (19♂♂3♀♀) were captured between September and November, 1966. This large number for the one year was remarkable as an exceptional occurrence for Honshu (Japan Main Island). In 1970 three individuals were recorded from Central Honshu: Mie Pref. (Aug.), Shizuoka Pref. (Sept.) and Kanagawa Pref. (Aug.). The Philippine D. chrysippus is said to differ from the Asia-Continental or Formosan D. chrysippus in its smaller white spots in broader black marginal band on the hind wing. Almost all the specimens caught in Honshu are rather allied to the former. Both typhoon and seasonal wind during the summer season on W. Pacific region may aid the migrant flight of this butterfly to Japan. The main origin of Japanese D. chrysippus is therefore considered to be the Philippines and/or their nearby

N2  - Since 1967, several lepidopterologists collected Princeps demoleus in Luzon island of the Philippines, and those specimens were identified as Taiwan subspecies, P. d. libanius FRUHSTORFER, by T. IWASE (1969). According to J. Jumalon (1969), this butterfly was collected in Luzon, Cebu and Leyte islands, and he thought that this butterfly was a new-commer to the Philippines from other country recently. The present author visited to Palawan island for malaria investigation in January, 1970, and he saw this butterfly in this island, but he could not collect it at that time. He had second chance to stay Palawan from October, 1970, to February, 1971, and he collected about twenty specimens of this butterfly. After his returning to Japan, he examined his collection and identified it as subspecies libanius. The author thought that this was one example of an artificial migration by ship. His assumption is as follows: this butterfly have been brought to Manila, Luzon island, with citrus saplings imported from Taiwan, and soon this citrus was replanted to Cebu, and the butterfly might also be brought to Cebu with citrus saplings and again to Leyte from Cebu. Since 1969, this butterfly further invaded to Palawan with citrus saplings from Luzon island. In Palawan this butterfly is distributed only in lowland areas near village and town. The author went to forest areas several times, but could not see it in such places. The author shows 4 pictures of Princeps demoleus libanius FRUHSTORFER collected in Palawan island (Fig.1a and b…♂.c and d…♀). He also shows the distribution map of P. demoleus in the Philippiens Fig. 2×…Distribution of this butterfly.→…Distribution course of this butterfly). According to a short report by S. Ae (1970), this butterfly was also collected in Negros and Mindanao islands.

N2  - In Ancylomia japonica ZELLER, the process from thoracic segmentation to shortening of the embryo is divided into eight stages, and the morphogenesis in each stage is described in the present paper. 1)The premandibular appendages appear as a pair of small ectodermal processes. They exist, however, for a while and disappear in later development. 2)The head is thought to consist of six parts, i.e., the acron, the antennal, the premandibular, the mandibular, the maxillary and the labial segments. 3)At first the abdomen consists of 11 segments, but later becomes ten segments through the loss of the tenth segment. 4)At the occurring of the stomodaeal invagination the endodermal cells are formed as the special cell-mass at the blind end of the stomodaeum. On the other hand, at the occurring of proctodaeal invagination there is no special cell-mass. The anterior mid-gut epithelium originates from the cells formed at the blind end of the stomodaeum. 5)The epipharynx is formed as a small process just in front of the opening of the stomodaeum. 6)Neuroblasts are formed in each segment. Later the ganglia of the gnathal segments fuse into one. When the tenth abdominal segment disappears, the ninth and the tenth abdominal ganglia fuse into one. 7)The labrum at first appears as a pair of processes, later these paired processes move medially to fuse togather. During this process a pair of coelomic sacs in the labral anlagen is observed, but these cavities are different from those of other coelomic sacs. 8)The suboesophageal body originates from the mesodermal cells of the ventral side of the stomodaeal invagination. This mesoderm belongs to the premandibular segment. 9)The stomatogastric system develops from the dorsal wall of the stomodaeal invagination. 10)The malpighian tubules are formed as a pair of the ectodermal invaginations at the blind end of the proctodaeum. 11)The ectodermal invagination in cephalic region consists of seven pairs, i.e., the anterior tentorium, the extensor mandibulae, the flexor mandibulae, the salivary gland, the posterior tentorium, the silk gland and the prothoracic gland. The author would like to think that the anterior tentorium, the extensor mandibulae, the flexor mandibulae and the salivary gland originate from the mandibular segment, the posterior tentorium from the maxillary segment, and the silk gland and the prothoracic gland belong to the labial segment.

N2  - In this paper the distiribution of Plebejus argus BUTLER in the Chugoku distirict is discussed. 1. In this distict this butterfly is distributed mainly in the mountainous region (the Chugoku-sanchi) from Kanmuri-yama (West end of the Chugoku-sanchi) to the line that links Chizu-Cho (Tottori Pref.) with Mimasaka-Cho (Okayama Pref.). It has not been found in Hyogo Prefecture. 2. The larva is fed on Cirsium sieboldi MIQ. in this area, but the factors influencing the distribution of this butterfly are not only food plant, but the presence of the moor. 3. The moors are found at fairly low lands in the Chugoku district, but the habitats of this butterfly in this district are conformable to the distribution of the moor with the association of Cirsieto-Molenietum japonicae in the mountainous region. 4. It is estimated that Plebejus argus extended its distribution from Korea Peninsula to the Chugoku district, and also extended to the northern parts of Japan from Amur and Saghalien in glacial age from Ris G1, to Wurm G1.

The author observed three cases of courtship behavior between helenus♀and xuthus ♂. Judging from these observations, there seems to be the possibility of hybridization between the above two species in the field. The details of the courtship flight are described. The absence or scarcity of helenus male seems to be one of the factor causing the interspecific courtship.

N2  - In this paper a new genus, Protapatura, is founded to receive the new species which is described by Mr. S. IGARASHI in the next paper. This new genus is remarkable not only in its systematic position but in its geographical distribution and habitat. The new genus superficially very much resembles the genus Apatura and its allies, but the structures of the male genitalia show some peculiar features, of which the basal structure of the saccus seems to be the most primitive in the Apaturinae, while the phallic and uncal structures are undoubtedly the results of unique specializations. The Apaturinae is one of the nymphalid groups of which the main habitats are in the Sino-Malayan region under the humid temperate and subtropical climates. The new genus is distributed in the Northern Iraq and it seems to be a relic genus of the primitive apaturines surviving in the border of the distributional range of the subfamily under the arid climate. The systematic postion of the new genus in the Apaturinae besides its geographical distribution is similar to that of the Archon in the Papilionidae. Before going further we would like to express our cordial thanks to Mr. SUGURU IGARASHI, who have first found the type-species under difficult condition, for his kindness allowing us to study on this unique type-species.

N2  - In this paper I describe a remarkable new species of the Nymphalidae, of which the first specimen was collected at Amadiya in the Northern Iraq during my collecting trip from June to July of 1970, and further two males and three females were collected at the same locality in summer of 1971. In this opportunity I wish to express deepest appreciation to the late Mr. TARO IWASE for his kind guidance during his lifetime, and also express regret over his death during my stay in Iraq. The specific name of this new species is dedicated to him. Particular thanks are due to Mr. T. G. HOWARTH, British Museum (Natural History), Professor T. SHIROZU, Kyushu University, and to Dr. Y. KUROSAWA, National Science Museum, Tokyo for their kind advices. My thanks are also due to Associate Professor T. SAIGUSA, Kyushu University for his kind suggestion on the male genitalia of the new species and to Mr. MATHEUS TOMA who cooperated with me during the collecting trip.

N2  - The Chrysozephyrus group occuring in the northern as well as middle mountainous areas of Formosa, includes some extremely similar species each other in appearance, especially C. mushaellus and esakii are so full of individual variety in their colour, marking, size, etc, that we have been studying on the limits of their variety and the confusion of some extremely resembling species. In consequence of our study, we have already published two new species, Chrysozephyrus yuchingkinus, in TYO TO GA, Vol. 11, No. 2, 1960, and Chrysozephyrus hsuehshanus, in Tohoku Konchu Kenkyu, Vol. 4, No. 2, p. 22-23, pl. 3, 1969, and further, in this time, two new Chrysozephyrus species are added to our science. We are greatly indebted to Mr. C. K. Yu at Puli in Formosa, who has placed many contributing Chrysozephyrus materials at our disposal. Most grateful thanks are also due to Mr. James R. Neidhoefer at Milwaukee in U.S.A. and Mr. S. K. Ong at Peitou in Formosa for their supreme support of our preparation for manuscript.

N2  - 1. The number and relative size of chromoromes are described in 9 species of butterflies from Malaysia. Among them 6 species are new to cytology : Troides (Trogonoptera) brookianus albescens, Troides (Troides) helena cerberus, Troides (Troides) amphrysus flavicollis, Delias hyparete diva, Dichorragia nesimachus deiokes and Euploea (Adigama) redtenbacheri redtenbacheri. 2. Chromosomal dimorphism was observed in Elymnias hypermnestra nigrescens and Delias hyparete diva. There exist some relation between geographical isolation and chromosomal variation.

N2  - Mating behavior of Peacock Pansy, Precis almana was observed. The results of observations are as follows: 1. Encounter of the female and the male, 2. Pursuiting, 3. Response of the female for the pursuiting male (flying and alighting), 4. Courtship (pattern of courtship and sense of smell), 5. Copulation, 6. Separation. Concerning the courtship in stage 4 there are some different patterns. Also it was confirmed that a female which has finished copulation behaves itself to refuse copulation against further pursuiting and courtship of a male.

N2  - Observation was made on the ovipositing habit and larval food plants of Polygonia c-aureum LINNE which was bred in the wire-netted cage shown in Fig. 1. In every generation eggs were laid not only on the food plant, Humulus japonicus SIEB. et Zucc., but on some other plants, wire gauze, bamboo poles and concrete blocks. Especially a considerable number of eggs were laid on concrete blocks (Tab. 2, Tab. 3). The larvae ate even Boehmeria spicata THUNB., Urtica Thunbergiana SIEB. et Zucc. and Celtis sinensis PERS. var japonica (PLANCH.) NAKAI, but most of them died in their early larval stage. Some of them grew into pupal stage, but never emerged. As being observed in the field, this species sometimes lays eggs in piles in the cage. But this ovipositing habit seems to be an exceptional case in this species.

N2  - In the present paper the author dealt with the morphological characters of larvae of four species belonging to the genus Calothysanis HUBNER (Geometridae, Sterrhinae), C. amata, C. comptaria, C. dichela, and C. apicirosea. The nomenclature for the setae is coincided with that of HINTON (1946). A seta "lambda" of FRACKER (1915), commonly found in the larvae of Geometridae on A1 to A7, referred to as "seta LD", used by SIGHN (1951) in his figures. These larvae have the combination of characters. Body form strongly enlarged at posterior half of T3 and A1. Body setae extremely short, but on A1 slightly longer, especially setae L2, LD and V1. Subventral setal group on A1 unisetose, bisetose on A2 and trisetose on A3 to A5. Prolegs of mature larva bear up to 31 biordinal crotchets incompletely separated into two groups. Seta CD2 of anal proleg distinctly above level of seta L3. Seta SD1 on A1 distinctly posterior to L2. Seta D1 on anal shield slightly posterior to L3. Based on larval characters, SIGHN (1951) divided the subfamily Sterrhinae into two distinct divisions, "A" and "B". This genus belongs to "Division A" by the above-mentioned characters. Probably "Division A" may be correspond with the tribe Cosymbinii, including this genus.

N2  - It appears now well-known that Bena fagana (FABRICIUS)(=prasinana auct.), a common Eurasian species, produces the second generation moth in different form in the warmer regions of Europe. It had been called under various names as distinct, till OBRAZTSOV (1943, 1950) published a conclusion. The oldest name applicable to the form is fiorii COSTN. (1911), of which hongarica WARREN (1913) and hispanica FERNANDEZ (1931) are synonyms. It has relatively shorter and broader forewing than in the typical or vernal form and only two median bands on it in both sexes. The moths known to us as Bena japonica (WARREN) is apparently the Japanese representation of the aestival form of fagana, occuring in major part of Japan in July towards August except in Hokkaido, where occurs only the typical form. In Japan and its neighboring areas there occurs another couple of species of the genus, named respectively kraeffti GRAESER and sylpha BUTLER. The latter form showing only two oblique median bands is, though peculiar in having purely white hindwing in both sexes, here concluded to represent the aestival form of the former appearing in early April to May. The fact was confirmed by breeding larvae obtained from ova laid by female kraeffti in spring. This species, for which the specific name sylpha BUTLER is the earlier one, is a resident of the lowlands shrubs, feeding preferably on the leaves of deciduous oak, Quercus acutissima and Q. serrata, in the area west of central Honshu. The synonymies will be given as follows. Bena fagana (FABRICIUS, 1781)=japonica WARREN, 1913, syn. nov. Bena sylpha (BUTLER, 1879)=kraeffti GRAESER, 1888, syn. nov.=magnifica LEECH, 1890, syn. nov. The difference of male genitalia between the two is slightest, but in female genitalia the shape of sclerotization of bursa copulatrix at near orifice to ductus bursae differs enough to separate them.

N2  - Geographical variations of Anthocaris cardamines LINNAEUS and Carterocephalus palaemon PALLAS in Japan were studied on the basis of many specimens from almost all of their known localities. A. cardamines distributed in the Akaishi mountain range and Mt. Yatsugatake is clearly distinguishable from A. c. isshikii, which is distributed in the Hida mountain range and Mt. Togakushi-yama. The author named ssp. hayashii to the butterflies distributed in the Akaishi mountain range and Mt. Yatsugatake. C. palaemon distributed in the Akaishi mountain range is also distinguishable from C. p. satakei distributed in the Hida mountain range. The author named the former ssp. akaishianus. In addition to these two species, some other butterflies have the geographical races in Central Japan which are similarly distributed as in the above mentioned two species. The author discussed the similality of their distribution and tried to interpret its origin.

N2  - Those species described in the present issue are characterized by quadrantic labial palpi, strongly elongated apiculus of antennae with more than 15 segments on nudum, well marked lower median vein which reaches near base of vein 4 in the discoidal cell of the forewing, and vein 5 being vestigial and inconspicuous on hindwing. With a few exceptions there is a remarkable similarity in the male genitalia of these species: dorsum with a large dorsal membranous area at the middle; scaphium with a pair of unci having the distal portion liable to be bilobed, and with a pair of lateral processes produced from the connecting portion with tegumen; gnathos with a distinct cochlear; valvae with saccus small, ill-developed, posterior portion of harpe expanding dorsally and divided into two lamellate or angled processes with minute serrations; phallus generally stout, somewhat dilated distally, apex oblique, vesica opened posterodorsally without sharply defined cornutus, suprazonal sheath of aedeagus with dorsal membranous area longitudinally ; juxta broad, lamellate. The authors consider that these species may be akin to each other primarily on account of the common characters of their genitalia, but more materials are needed to define the relationship between those and the other species of the "Plastingia group" as EVANS put it.

N2  - 1. "Neope goschkevitschii (MENETRIES, 1855)", belonging to Satyridae, includes the two "forms" known as "the mountain form" and "the plain form". Each of these "forms", however, should be treated as the independent species, the mountain species and the plain species. The scientific names of both species must be determined after the prudent investigation of the type-specimens of the known forms. 2. Both species are widely distributed over the Japanese Islands. The plain species is distributed in both plains and mountains from the middle part of Hokkaido to the southern part of Kyushu, and the mountain species is mainly distributed in the mountanous region from Sachalin to Yaku Island, south of Kyushu. 3. The differences of the adults of both species are present in the wing shape, the number of branches of the marginal scales, and the markings of upperside and underside of wings. But these species are so similar to each other that it is necessary to investigate carefully all characters for the correct identification of these species. Generally the underside of wings of the mountain species is more melanized than that of the plain species, and in both species the spring form is more melanized than the summer form. 4. Number of instars is generally 5 in both species, but partially 6. The morphological and ethological differences of larvae of both species are observed in each instar, especially in the 2nd instar. 5. Both species pupate among fallen (dead) leaves attaching itself to the leaf with the cremaster. No definite morphological differences of pupae are seen between the two species. 6. Both species have two generations a year in the low altitude, one in the high altitude; in the mountain species, however, the upper limit of the range, where two generations are seen, is situated in the somewhat higher altitude. The plain species occurs in various bamboo associations against the mountain species which is limited to the Sasa associations. In the behaviours of adults, some differences are found in both species, too.

N2  - An oriental swallowtail butterfly, Papilio memnon, is highly polymorphic and divided into many subspecies, races and forms. It ranges over the Kyushu Main Island (subsp. thunbergii), the Amami Is. and the Okinawa Is. (subsp. pryeri) in Japan, and is also widely distributed in Formosa (subsp. heronus). In these habitats it is known as one of the commonest species. On the contrary, only three male specimens have been recorded from the Sakishima Is., located between the Okinawa Is. and Formosa, where no females have been hitherto found. One of these three males is similar to subsp. heronus. In 1964, one male and two females were captured from Iriomote Is., the Sakishima Is,. The male specimen is not similar to subsp. heronus but nearly the same as subsp. pryeri. The females are extraordinarily albinized in comparison with any known races from Japan, Formosa or their neighborhoods. Accordingly, the precise taxonomic name for P. memnon from the Sakishima Is. should remain innominate at present. A major reason why P. memnon is rare in the Sakishima Is. may lie in the scantiness of the cultivated Citrus, its main food-plant.

N2  - Im 1937, hat Herr H. DOI zwei Arten d. h. Colias marcopolo nicolopolo and C. viluiensis aus Nordkorea aufgeschrieben. Doch sind seine Beschreibungen ungenau, and nehmen keine Abbildung mit. Ferner, seit seine Veroffentlichung bis jetzt, ist zweites Exemplar noch nicht erbeutet, so dass der Fundort beider Colias in Korea bedeutend zweifelhaft sind. Dagegen, vorkommt gewiss Erebia kozhantshikovi in Nordkorea, die von D. M. SOEK (1941) aus derselben Gegend registriert wurde, wegen seinen deutlichen Figuren, obgleich nur ein Exemplar ♀ bis jetzt entdeckt wird. Weil in diesem weiblichen Exemplar, die rot-braune Binde der Vorderflugeloberseite erheblich breiter als im Sibirischen Stucke ist, ist es moglich dad dass koreanische Stuck eine neue Unterart vertritt. Aus dem Fuss des Berges Myokosan (2446 m), Praf, Niigata, Mitteljapan, beschreibe ich eine neue Rasse von Lycaeides subsolanus, als ssp. myokoensis nov. Diese Rasse steht sehr nahe anderer Rasse togakusiensis MURAYAMA, 1964, aber bestimmt grosser. ♂ Oberseite ist klarer, der schwarze Rand des Vorderflugels ist schmaler, der innere Umriss des Randes ist trube. In wenigen mannlichen Exemplare, erscheint kleine rot-gelbe Zeichnung im submarginalen Feld zwischen Analis 2 und Cubitus 1 der Hinterflugeloberseite. In anderer wenigen Exemplare, treten andere Aberration in der Hinterflugel-unterseite hervor. Der schwarze Punkt nahe Basalfeld und die schwarze Flecke des Mittelfeldes in 1 Cubitalzelle verschmelzen, so bilden eine lange grosse Zeichnung aus. Zwei obenerwahnte Neigungen erscheinen mehr oder weniger auch in mehrerer mannlicher Stucke, aber nicht in subsolanus togakusiensis so wie subsolanus yarigadakeana. ♀, Die rote Submarginalbinde beider Flugeloberseite sind auffallend. Die Unterseite neigt zur Vergrosserung aller schwarzen Punkte und zur Ausbildung uberzahliger. Die Futterpflanzen sind Vicia deflexa in der neue Rasse, dagegen Astragalus sp. und Hedysarum sp., in togakusiensis.

N2  - The author attempts to identify the white butterflies as appearing in old Japanese drawings and literary works, with emphasis on Pieris rapae crucivora BOISDUVAL. 1) The word 'So-cho' found in a poetical work entitled 'Kaifuso' published between 701 and 705 A.D. is the earliest reference to white butterflies so far known. There is no telling, however, whether the word meant Pieris rapae or P. melete. 2) What is believed to be one of the earliest illustrations of P. rapae is a sketch by OKYO MARUYAMA, done in 1776. 3) The life of larva, which was depicted by RANZAN ONO (ca. 1803), probably concerned P. rapae. We may trace this line back to 'Jokyo-reki' (1684). The late Dr, NOBUMASA YAGI, as well as Mr. TARO IWASE, president of L. S. J., maintained that P. rapae had fortuitously been introduced into Japan. The author subscribes to this opinion. The supposed time of arrival of this species to Japan is, in his opinion, during the Kofun (ancient tomb) Age (ca. 300-600 A.D.). The cultivated rapa plant is believed to have been brought into this country by the immigrants, from the Chinese Mainland by way of the Korean Peninsula, and the whites must have accompanied the plant in some form or another, at the younger stages.

N2  - A mixure of 40g of sorbic acid and 30g of methyl p-hydroxy-benzoate dissolved in 340 ml of 95 percent ethanol was used as an antiseptic for rearing larvae of Papilio xuthus by artificial diet. The duration of development in earlier instars was prolonged by antiseptic. No effect of antiseptic, however, was recognized on the durations of the last instar and pupal stages, larval and pupal mortalities.

N2  - The larvae of Favonius cognatus STAUDINGER were reared individually on flower buds of Quercus serrata THUNB. under the environmental condition of 16-21℃. Their faecal pellets which meets the longitudinal axis at right angle was measured by the scale on glass plate of the shadowgraph. Daily increments of size of faecal pellets following the growth within instar were similar for the 1st-4th instars in all larvae. However, those increments within an instar were not significant. The increment of size of faecal pellets on the first day after moulting, between successive instars, was expressed by a linear equation. The growth of head capsules between successive instars for the 1st-3rd instars was also expressed by a linear equation. From the equation obtained, the width of head-capsule at the fourth instar, which is usually moulted at broken state, was estimated.

N2  - The larvae of Chrysozephyrus aurorinus OBERTHUR were reared individually on flowering buds of Quercus serrata THUNB, under the laboratory condition of 16〜21℃. The faecal pellets were collected daily and the maximum diameter which meets the longitudinal axis at right angle was measured by the scale on the glass plate of the shadowgraph. Daily increments of size of faecal pellets following the growth within an instar were similar for the 1st-4th instars in all larvae. However, those increments within an instar were not significant. The increment of size of faecal pellets on the first day after moulting, between succesisive instars, was expressed by a linear equation in female and by a quadratic equation in male. The growth of head capsules of exuviae of the same individuals for the 1st-3rd instars, was also expressed by a linear equation in female and by a quadratic equation in male. It is impossible to measure the width of exuviae of head capsules of the 4th instar as they are usually moulted at broken state. The growth of head capsules between four successive instars was also expressed by a linear equation in female and a quadratic equation in male. In this case the 4th instar larvae were killed and the head capsule used for measurement. The same relations were obtained in the growth of frons of exuvia of head capsule. The width of the head capsule at the 4th instar could be estimated using the equation calculated from the measurements for the 1st-3rd instars. In the case of rearing under the condition of insectary of 25℃, 60% R. H and long photopoperiod of 130lux, quadratic equations were obtained for both female and male. The duration of larval and pupal development in the rearing of insectary condition were much shorter than that of rearing under the laboratory condition.

N2  - It is confirmed that Precis almana Linnaeus has been established at the plains of Miyazaki City from about 1963 and its larvae feed on Hygrophila lancea (THUMB.) MIQUEL (Acanthaceae) in this district. The butterfly alternates 3-5 generations a year. In the case of 5 generations, the adults appear at the ends of May, June, July and August and the begining of October. After November the larvae and eggs died both from cold and a shortage of food-plant, which is nipped by the frost. However the adults of the last generation emerged in October hibernate and lay eggs in the next spring.

N2  - Only a few examples of homoeotic aberration have been described in Japan. Here, two specimens of homoeosis which appeared in Pieris are described. The first specimen is a male of Pieris napi japonica SHIROZU caught at Mt. Nyugasa in Nagano Prefecture on Aug. 23, 1955. The pattern of the underside of the anal-half right forewing is reproduced on the corresponding portion of the right hind wing. The second specimen, a female of Pieris melete MENETRIES, was captured by Mr. I. HIRAI at Asuke, Aichi Prefecture on June 26, 1955. In this specimen, the upperside of the right anal-half pattern of the forewing is reproduced on the right hind wing. The upperside of the first specimen and the underside of the second specimen are nearly normal. In both cases, there is some atrophy at the anal part of the abnormal hindwing, and the copy of the forewing pattern on the hindwing is not complete, the abnormal spots being invaded by white area of the original background.

N2  - The Formosan species described in this paper is allied to Argyresthia andereggiella (DUPONCHEL), occurring in Europe, Siberia and Japan, but is apparently distinct from it in the following points : noticeably larger, measuring 14mm across the forewing as compared with 9-11mm, the lack of two fasciae on the forewing, and darker in the colour of markings; on the male genitalia, the valva ovate instead of elongate-ovate in shape, and the aedeagus shorter and twice the length of the valva, whereas about three times in andereggiella, etc.

N2  - It is well known that the female of the Cabbage white, Pieris rapae, and other species belonging to the same genus refuses mating in a posture of her wings outspread and abdomen lifted obliquely. According to my observations in Hokkaido, however, the female of Aporia crataegi, even if the male approaches, never lifts her abdomen. The male settles directly on her back, flutters his wings and repeatedly stimulates her with his antennae and legs. This violent courting behavior of the males may strip off the scales of wings of the females.

N2  - Some basic experiments were carried to investigate the factors to determine the seasonal forms of Precis almana LINNAEUS. Photoperiod and temperature have influence on determination of the seasonal forms in this species. Although either one of these two factors independently has an effect in certain cases, the photoperiod is considered to be the main cause. The shorter photoperiod and lower temperature are concerned for the determintation of the autumn form, and either one of them alone has a considerable effect on it. However, in case that both factors act additionally to each other, 100% of materials become the autumn form. On the other hand, the longer photoperiod and heigher temperature are concerned for the determination of the summer form, and either one of them alone has considerable effect on it. When both act additionally, 100% of material become the summer form.

N2  - In present paper, some noticeable aberrant forms of Papilio nepheles chaonulus, P. helenus fortunius, P. protenor amaurus, and a new important species of Neptis in Formosa are described. P. chaonulus includes the numerous forms, of which No.1, No.2, No.3, No.4, No.5 etc., are new to science. In ♀-f.No.1, underside on forewing, appears the white diagonal band from costa to outer margin. On hindwing, appears the obscure greyish yellow crescent markings in outer submarginal area and the same colour marking near anal angle. Underside of forewing bears the transverse white band as on upperside. Ab. No.1 is apparently very similar to ab. horina, in which the submarginal yellow crescent markings on underside of hindwing extend inwards to approach or fuse the white markings, but differs from it in having the white markings, which extend outwards to approach or fuse the submarginal yellow crescent markings. On upperside of hindwing also, ab. No.1 have much outwards extending large markings, on the contrary, the markings of hindwing on upperside in ab. horina are constantly normal. Tail of hindwing in ab. No.1 tends to become short. Ab. No.3 is a form in which all submarginal yellow crescent markings of hindwing on underside changed to darkish yellow. In ab. No.4, the same crescent markings as well as whitish yellow markings near anal angle changed to white. In ab. No.5. the same crescant markings extend to outend to outer margin, becoming the large patches, which bear the greyish yellow scales. We have two deformities of chaonulus. In only right hindwing on both sides of them, the white markings extend towards the discoidal cell. Papilio helenus fortunius have two aberrant forms. Ab. No.8, is a form extinguishing all submarginal red crescent markings on hindwing of underside. In contrast with it, ab. No.9, have the same red crescent markings extending inwards to become large patches. To Papilio protenor amaurus belong ab. No.10, and ab. kagaribi Nakahara. In the former, all markings of hindwing on underside disappeared, the latter have much enlarged red markings of the same. The race amaurus is usually tailless in hindwing, and have very rarely a tail, however this tail does not so perfectly produce as in the Japanese race demetrius. It is shorter and narrower than in demetrius. Normal form of demetrius has the tail, but rarely the tail degenerates to become short and narrow size (ab. tokionis), which is quite same as the tailed form of amaurus. Probably, ab, tokionis suggests the prototype of protenor before the two races demetrius and amaurus differentiate. Here I give the description of a new species, Neptis disparalis, from Poli, Central Formosa. The type-specimen was misidentified, by A. Shibatani (1943) as Neptis mahendra reducta, and by T. Shirozu (1960) as a spring form of Neptis soma lutatia. The new species is very allied to N. soma lutatia, but all white markings are more developed. On upperside of forewing, the white streak in discoidal cell is more distinct, becomes bold in tip. The white markings of interspaces 1b,3,5,6,7 are larger. The central white band of hindwing is much distinct, becomes bold from inner margin to outer one. All white markings of both wings on upperside look somewhat pale. Ground colour of underside is lighter. The central white band of hindwing on underside does not pass in the base of interspace 4 (passes in soma lutatia). The process in the tip of valve, of male genitalia, is wider, and the ventral process is sharper than the allied Neptis species such as aceris, soma lutatia, yerburyi, nandina formosana, etc.

N2  - 1. A copulating pair between Papilio machaon hippocrates ♀ and P. xuthus ♂ was captured on April 30, 1967, at Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture. Interspecific copulations between these two species seem very rare in nature. 2. This hippocrates female laid seven eggs. Five of these eggs started to develop and two of them hatched. One larva did not feed on Parsley, but Natsumikan (Citrus natsudaidai HAYATA), and another fed on Parsley. 3. Ground color of the 5th instar larva fed on Parsley was dark yellow, and one fed on Natsumikan was pale green. These larvae grew faster than P. xuthus larvae which were reared at the same time, but were smaller. 4. Ground color of the hybrid pupae were both yellowish light brown and the shapes resemble pupae of hippocrates. 5. These two pupae emerged as males. These hybrid adults more resemble hippocrates adults than xuthus adults in general.

N2  - According to our observations at Ishigaki-island, Loochoo, in August 1965, this lycaenid usualy lays eggs on the flower bud or bud stalk of host plant, Derris uliginosa BENTHAM (Leguminosae). Strange to say, the eggs are always enveloped in the secretion of frothy material which, just after secretion, resembles that of spitlle bugs, but coagulates after about twenty-five minutes. The number of laid egg is counted through frothy covering. Among 33 eggs counted in total, 2 are laid singly and the rest in 13 groups, 1, 3 and 9 groups containing 4, 3 and 2 eggs, respectively. The newly hatched larva eats its way out of egg-shell and dried frothy covering and burrows into a bud as do the caterpillar of Lampides boeticus.

N2  - Generally, under the field conditions, the pine moth, Dendrolimus spectabilis BUTLER, passes one generation in a year. In the vicinity of Shimizu, adults emerge in July-August and deposit their eggs on pine leaves. Newly hatched larvae grow untill the 4th or 5th instar within the year, then enter into diapause for overwintering in early November. In April of the next year, they begin their feeding again and grow untill the 8th instar, then pupate. Under the conditions of long photoperiod, however, they do not enter into diapause and they repeat generations. Moreover, the number of larval moults decreases 1 or 2 times. The result shown in Table 1 is the number of moults of the larvae reared on pine leaves under a laboratory condition of 25℃ and 60% R. H. with the daylength maintained at 24 hrs by artificial illumination. The total developmental durations of these broods were remarkably decreased compared with the brood passed one generation in a year. As shown in Table 2, the duration of the second brood was ranged from 48 to 111 days. The growth of width of head capsule in successive instars varied with sex and the number of moultings. The relations between log width of head capsule and larval instars were represented by the linear, quadratic or cubic regression equations. Big variations between individuals were recognized in adult size, colour, width of head capsules of larvae, and development period, etc.

N2  - 1. The process of embryonic development of Pieris rapae crucivora BOISDUVAL is divided into 22 stages and the morphogenesis of the embryo at each stage is described. 2. The relationship between embryonic development and temperature is explained. At 9〜35℃ the embryo develops normally and the term of the embryonic development is the shortest at 30〜31℃. At 16〜31℃ the following phenomena are recognized, that is, the relation between time and temperature is D=aT^2+bT+c, and between the verocity of growth of embryo and temperature is V=aT+b. 3. The zero point of embryonic development based on the hatching of larvae is 9℃, but the embryos still continue to develop at lower temperature than 9℃, the true zeropoint of embryonic development may be lower.

N2  - Here is recorded the first discovery of the moth of the genus Elwesia HAMPSON from the region other than the Sikhim district. The specimens collected in Japan (1♂1♀, Mt. Zozu, Shikoku, Nov. 14, 1964, H. TOSHIMA leg.) fairly match the description of the Himalayan, and were determind safely as Elwesia diplostagma HAMPSON, a female type of which has been known. The genitalia as figured are characteristic in having spatulate uncus, very narrow valva bearing well-developed lunar-shaped cucullus with marginal corona, and truncate bottom of saccus.

N2  - Under laboratory condition, the larvae of the Soshigaya and Nakaizu races of the Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., were reared separately on leaves of rose and persimon. Females of the Soshigaya race moulted six or five times in their larval stage and males moulted five times. Females of the Nakaizu race moulted six or five times and males moulted five or four times. The relations of log-width of exuviae of head capsule to instar number were found to be presented by the curvilinear equations shown in Table 2. As shown in Fig.1, the width of head capsule of the Soshigaya race is larger than that of the Nakaizu race, and that of females is larger than that of males, and also that of individuals moulted six times is larger than that of individuals moulted five times. As shown in Table 3, the similar relations were found in the duration of larval stage, but on the contrary the pupal period of female is shorter than that of male in both Soshigaya and Nakaizu races. As is seen in Fig.2, we shall be able to determine the instar in which a larva belongs by measuring of width of exuviae of head capsule in the larvae ranging from the 1st to 3rd instars but we shall fail to tell the instar number by this method in the larvae ranging from the 4th to the last instars. The width of the head capsule, However, will fulfil the purpose of the rough presumption of instar to which a larva belongs.

N2  - Hitherto, Deudorix kuyaniana MATSUMURA has been treated as the endemic species in Formosa, but in this time, a male specimen of this species was found from Cholon in South Vietnam, and was named as the new race cholonensis, which differs from the original race in bearing some more thick darkish short bands on underside of both wings. Narathura abseus has no record in Formosa, but the late S. HIRAYAMA illustrated this species from Formosa (Musha) in his work (1939), although he has treated this species by mistake as N. birmana uchidae (=asakurae). So we must enumerate N. abseus in the list of Formosan butterflies. It seems to me very rare. Spindasis takanonis in Siga Pref. and Yamanashi Pref. represent each the new subspecies. In the former, ssp. morinis nov., black markings on underside of both wings are very much conspicuous and thick. Central two black bands on underside of forewing tend to be linked together in H shape. In the latter, ssp. ohkuranis nov., black markings on underside are generally small or slender. Of two central black bands on underside of hindwing, outer black band remarkably winds or becomes intermittent.

N2  - I found a hitherto unknown mature larva of Papilionidae on Sassafras randaiense (Fig.8,4m in height) at Taipinshan (1,850m), Ilan Hsien, Taiwan on the 20th of August, 1966. The larva was found sitting on the upperside of a leaf of the tree 3m above the ground. It was 60mm in length, deep green in ground colour with unique dark brown markings (Figs,1,2). It became a prepupa (Figs.3,4) on the 23rd of August and pupated on next day. The pupa (Figs 5-7) was 35 mm in length and hibernated, After 255 days of pupal stage, unexpectedly a female of Agehana maraho SHIRAKI et SONAN emerged from the pupa on the 6th of May. 1967, Judging from the circumstances, the food-plant of this butterfly seems to be Sassafras randaiense.

N2  - A larva of Agehana maraho was discovered on the upper surface of a leaf of Sassafras randaiense, which may be its food-plant, by Mr. LIAO at Taipinshan, Ilan Hsien, Taiwan. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: 1. The full-grown larva, about 60mm long, which was collected on August 20, 1966, pupated on August 24, hibernated in pupal stage, and emerged on May 6, 1967. 2. In Agehana maraho, the larva belongs to Papilio type, has some resemblance in shape and colour to that of Papllio macilentus, but can be noticed some difference in their stripes. 3. The pupa, about 35mm long, seems a kind of Papilio too. But the pupal skin with some dorso-spiracular tubercles and subdorsal tubercles, which can not be found in the other Papilionidae, feels rough.

N2  - A female butterfly posessing mature eggs in her abdomen begins ovipositing on a sheet of paper immediately after the injection at her middle thorax of a little bit of 90% ethanol, When injected her middle and hindlegs are paralysed and accordingly the manual countenance by the operater will be needed. The trial may be repeated with the same individual when she recovered from the paralysis after 12-24 hours, This new method will serve to the collectors willing to obtain eggs and yet to have an intact specimen of the female butterfly.

N2  - Luehdorfia japonica and L. puziloi are phylogenetically primitive, oriental Papilionid butterflies. Their Japanese distribution is well investigated: the former ranges over central to western Honshu, while the latter over the central to northeast of Honshu and Hokkaido. Thus there exists a quite distinct "habitat segregation" among the two, and the "Luehdorfia-line" is advocated as a biogeographical boundary-line. The Kiso Valley is just located on the "Luehdorfia-line", where two Luehdorfia species are localized in a few separate habitats and less common than the adjacent regions: L. puziloi is restricted to the northern part and L. japonica is found only from the southern part of the Valley. Neither has been recorded from the middle part. Such characteristic may be explained by the following facts: The Valley is situated between the steep Kiso Mountains and Mt. Kiso-Ontake, of which volcanic activity was in Quaternary. Moreover, the greater part of this district is covered with well-developed evergreen coniferous forest inhibiting the spontaneity of both food-plants and adult feeding-plants. The food-plants of Luehdorfia are also phylogenetically primitive Aristolochiaceae: Heterotropa in L. japonica and Asiasarum in L. puziloi. They had reached us from the Asian Continent during or prior to the Tertiary, extended their areas of distribution and have produced many geographical races. L. japonica chooses Sect, Bicornes in preference to the remainders of genus Heterotropa as the ovipositing plants and food-plants. In this paper, it is postulated that the geographical or ecological distribution of L. japonica has an intimate connection with the spontaneity of its main food-plant, Sect. Bicornes.

N2  - 1. We recorded 19 species of butterflies belonging to 4 families, and 75 species of moths of 5 families caught in the butterfly traps during 1965. 2. Many of the moths collected are common species or genera to those classified as fruit-piercing moths or those attracted by sap (Table 1). 3. Contrary to our anticipation many females have been attracted by butterfly traps. We have shown in this paper the sex ratio of some lepidopterous insects obtained by butterfly trap (Table 2). 4. We have given some suggestions on the future improvement and practices for collecting lepidoptera by the similar methods.

N2  - The immature stages and life-history of Mycalesis gotama nanda FRUHSTORFER were investigated in North Formosa in the period from Oct. 1963 to Jan. 1964. 1. Egg-laying and egg: In the evening the female butterfly lays about 2-6 eggs in rows on the underside of a leaf of the food-plants. An egg is semi-globular, very minutely and irregularly reticulated, and pale green in colour ; its diameter is 0.9 mm.,_and height 1.1 mm. 2. Food-plants: Syntherisma sanguinalis, Leersia hexandra, Oryza sativa, Oplismenus japonicus, Pollinia will denowiana, Paspalum conjugatum, Digitaria chinensis, Miscanthus sinensis. Oplismenus patens. 3. Larva: The larvae are gregarious and sit on the underside of leaves. The coloration of body is green in the 1st and 2nd instars, but after 3rd instar the brown type appears besides the ordinary green one, and the larvae of this type are especially abundant in the gloomy habitat. The green larvae may change into the brown type in every 3rd to 5th instar. As a matter of course, the ratio of the numbers of brown type larvae to those of green ones is highest in the larvae of 5th instar grown under gloomy circumstances. The coloration in larval stage has no relation to that in pupal stage. The length of 5th instar larvae is about 34mm. 4. Pupa: The pupae are usually found on the underside of leaves or stems of the food-plants (in this case the pupae are always green in colour), but they are sometimes found on the dead twings or the clods (in this case the pupae are brown). The length of pupae is about 15mm. The hibernating stage is the pupae. 5. Flying period: Five broods in a year; the first brood appears in the middle to the end of January, the second brood in April, the third in June, the fourth in July and the last brood in October.

N2  - Before the outbreak of Precis almana began from 1965 in Miyazaki City, Southern Kyushu, the butterfly rarely found in this district was considered as the migrant from more southern area. I engaged the ecological study of the species since October 1963, and I could prove the butterfly can survive the winter in adult stage and can continue their generations in this city by field collecting and breeding experiments in laboratory from November 1965 to April 1966.

N2  - In 1910 Matsumura described Everes kiamurae from Yaeyama group of the Ryukyus and later he (1913) transferred it from Everes to Euchrysops. Since then, no information of this species had been available until Yashiro (1932) recorded it from Okinawa-Honto and Iheya Island of the Ryukyus. Yashiro did not give the date of collecting and, moreover his identification was doubtful. Recently Shirozu (1965) transferred it from Euchrysops to Chilades on the basis of the genitalic structures and assumed the species in the Ryukyus as a migrant from the Philippines. In August 1966, Nagamine rediscovered it at Taketomi Island belonging to the Yaeyama group, and observed that it was common there at that time. Two months later, the senior author was at Taketomi Island and observed the habits and early stages of the species from the end of October to the middle of November. After he retured to Osaka, the authors were given some additional specimens of the cold-season form by Mr. Takana from Taketomi Island. Thus we knew much about the hitherto unknown facts on this insect, which we report in this paper.

N2  - 1. In this paper, the distribution of Parnassius glacialis BUTLER (Papilionidae) in Shizuoka Prefecture and its vicinity, is discussed. 2. The species is distributed mainly in the mountain-zone west of the Tenshi-Range. It has not been found in the Izu Peninsula, the most area of Mt. Fuji, and the coastal district of Suruga Bay and the Sea Enshu. 3. The habitats of the species is generally established in deep valleys always enveloped in a fog in summer. 4. The high temperature in summer, which occurs mainly in the coastal district, may be unfavorable for the estivation of eggs. 5. The larva is found on Corydalis incisa PERS. (Papaveraceae) in this area as in many localities the other parts of Japan. 6. Transition of climate, volcanic activities and other movements of earth's crust through Pleistocene, must have had great influence upon the establishment of the present distribution.

N2  - Five eggs were obtained from a Papilio protenor female which was collected at Kagoshima City, Kyushu, Japan by the writer, Four larvae hatched from these eggs and all of the larvae reached their mature stages and the pupations occured. However, two of them were not perfect. Three male adults emerged from them and these individuals showed the intermediate characters between P. protenor and P. helenus (see Figs. 3〜8). They are approximately the same with the interspecific hybrids between P. protenor and P. helenus, which were obtained at the laboratory by Ae (1962a,b). Therefore, it is presumed that the above P. protenor female copulated with P. helenus male in nature and the interspecific hybrids were obtained.

N2  - In August 1965 the writer witnessed a pairing between a female Papilio maackii and a male Papilio bianor at a point about 1,200m above sea level near Mt. Amari, Yamanashi Prefecture. After the butterflies parted they were collected separately, and the female, then very fresh, was later entrusted to an LSJ member for egg-laying. The female laid altogether about 130 eggs on Phellodendron amurense, but only one of them produced a larva, the rest either rotting or shrinking. The larva, more like that of P. maackii than to P. bianor in outlook, grew until after the fourth moult. However, its growth stopped soon afterwards and died. As Dr. S. A. Ae (Tyo to Ga, Vol, XII, Pt. 4, 1961) has indicated, the hatchability of eggs and the vitality of hybrid larvae seem to be poor between these two species, no matter how the hybridizing pairing may be effected either artificially or spontaneously.

N2  - Through the courtesy of Dr. S. ISSIKI, I had an opportunity to study his collection of Pterophoridae from Japan, Formosa and Hainan. The material treated in this paper was collected by Dr. S. ISSIKI in Japan between 1949 and 1952, in Formosa between 1932 and 1946 and in Hainan in 1942. The study of the Formosan Pterophoridae has not been worked well though the fauna in this family of Formosa is supposed to be rich. Up to the present, 22 species have been known from Formosa and no species has been known from Hainan so far as I ascertained. The present material which is in good condition, in consequence, is valuable for the study of the fauna of Formosa. The present material consists of 44 specimens belonging to 18 species of 11 genera. I examined Here 9 species from Japan, 14 species from Formosa and 1 species from Hainan. Four species are recorded here for the first time from Shikoku, Japan, 7 species from Formosa and 1 from Hainan respectively. I would like to express my hearty gratitude to Prof. K. YASUMATSU and Prof. Y. HIRASHIMA for their constant guidance and encouragement. I am much indebted to Dr. S. ISSIKI for his kindness in giving me the opportunity to study his valuable collection of Pterophoridae and his useful suggestion for my study.

I have recorded in this paper 22 species belonging in 4 families collected from the northern part of the Japan Alps since the previous reports, further I have examined the morphological proportion of the males with both species Actias selene gnoma and Actias artemis aliena collected in the same area. The results of examination are showing Fig 2 and Table 1. 2. The life history of Lithophane rosinae PUNGELER; the biological observations with the larval stages of this moth were carried out from the spring in 1963 to the autumn in 1964 in Omachi-city by the outdoor rearing on Prunus. The life cycle is showing Table 4. The female moths layed eggs at random on the trunk of the food plant, hatching in spring. The larval duration is about 40 days, the grown larva makes the cocoon with fallen leaves or into the ground 2-3 cm, depths and estivate in it on the pre-pupa stage about 2 months in summer. Emergence in autumn and hibernate as it is.

Southeast Asian Hesperiinae was divided into many generic groups by EVANS (1949) based upon the wing venation, shape and relative length of antennae, shape of palpi, and the structure of legs. On the arrangement of the genera, we will mainly follow EVANS' system.

N2  - In order to elucidate the causes of the migration of Lampides boeticus in the eastern part of Japan, the author has proposed a hypothesis. That is, the migrations of this butterfly in spring and summer are attributable to the south winds caused by some special atmospheric distributions, which are shown in weather charts: 'May storm', or similar low pressure in the Japan Sea, or summer typhoon in the East China Sea. In this paper, 55 records of this butterfly collected in the migration seasons in the eastern part of Japan are listed, and most of them are in good agreement with the days on which the said atomospheric distributions appeared in weather charts. The author also discussed several aspects of the migration, and concluded as follows: (1) The exceptional early arrivals of this butterfly in the Tohoku district can be well explained by the proposed hypothesis. (2) There was no substantial difference between the short and long distance migrations, contrary to what had been generally thought. (3) The recorded dates of capture are in good agreement with the emerging season of the adult butterflies in southern Boso peninsula, from where, it can be presumed, they started. (4) It can also be presumed that high temperature and high humidity of the south winds were favoured by the migrating butterflies. (5) It is thought that, this habit of the butterflies has well adapted to the climatic changes in the northern hemisphere.

N2  - In this paper the author has reported an observation on the emergence from pupa of Clanis bilineata tsingtauica MELL, with short notes on the variation of wing colour and the size of adults. The moths emerge from pupae laying under the ground few or ten cm, in depth and dig out on the ground with frons of pupa on their head just like as steel helmets on soldiers' head. The emergences are observed mostly from 11p.m. to 5 a.m. of next day and the moths fly away after 15-21 hours or more.

N2  - On October 31,1962 I observed a female blue monarch (Caduga sita niphonica) in captivity busily patting all over its thorax by the uncoiled tougue, after having imbibed the pure water sprayed on the window frame. Its antennae were almost horizontal while resting, a little downed while imbibing, and placed lower while patting. These patting motions are probably similar to the "Washing" in the American Monarch observed by Mrs. A. L. HORF, as introduced by Mr. TARO IWASE in 1958.

N2  - According to the records of collection and eye-witness shown in Table 1, the Peacock Pansy, Precis almana L. in the southmost region of Kyushu Island was certainly uncommon until 1957 and generally regarded as one of migrant species. It is noteworthy, however, that since 1958 the species became suddenly abundant and its distribution extended northward. It is an aim of this paper to consider the factors influencing the distribution and abundance of this butterfly. As reported in the previous paper, this species winters as an adult and has three to five generations a year in this region. Hibernated females exclusively lay eggs on Lippia nodiflora (Verbenaceae), a perennial herb, in spring. On this host plant the species can breed from generation to generation throughout the year. Some butterflies of the first or second generation, however, scatter and fly to paddy fields where grows an annual weed, Lindernia verbenaefolia (Scrophulariaceae), which serves as food for larvae and as favorable nectar-source for adults, subsequent generations being succeeded there. In the southern Kyushu Lindernia germinates from the latter of June to the beginning of July, blooms from August to November and withers in winter. In case of traditional cultivation of rice plants, this weed can not grow so thick as to breed larvae of the butterfly on account of the coincidence of the transplanting and weeding period of rice plants with the sprouting period of the weed. Since 1957 or there abouts, the early cultivation of rice plants was commenced at a number of districts and the acreage of such cultivation increased year by year. In this case some fields are left in fallow after harvest (the beginning of August at the latest), and Lindernia grows in such fields enough to breed offspring of the butterfly dispersing from the habitat in which Lippia is present. This is the main reason why a considerable number of specimens have been discovered during summer and autumn in scattered localities. If there is no Lippia, a host plant in spring, in these localities, no individual of the first generation may be discovered in the following year, even though a few females successfully hibernate. This butterfly becomes established only in the locality where Lippia is distributed. Up to the present, I confirmed that the species occurs at Sata (the southmost of the Osumi Peninsula) all the year. The restricted localities in which the species may be found established by further investigations are shown with large arrows in Fig. 1.

N2  - Erebia niphonica amarisana subsp. nov. Extremely allied to subsp. sugitanii SHIROZU, but differs from it in having broader fulvous band of hindwing on upperside, and somewhat smaller size. This race occurs in Mt. Amarisan (1671m.) and the South Japan Alps mountains. Erebia niphonica togakusiana subsp. nov. This large race is closely similar to the race tateyamana MURAYAMA, but distinguishes it in the following points ; upperside, the fulvous red band of forewing is somewhat smaller narrower, the same of hindwing conspicuously degenerates to the small red spot or patch. This race occurs only in Mt. Togakusiyama (1911m.), Nagano prefecture. Wagimo signatus signatus BUTLER, ab. iwateanus nov. Upperside, purplish markings appear only in the space 1 and the base of the space 2. Underside, the middle and base area of both wings become darkish grey and only the marginal area is yellowish orange. There are two silver bars in discocellular and the obscure silver band outside of it. Known from the prefecture Iwate, northern Honshu. Coreana stygiana BUTLER, f, odai nov. Underside, the marginal as well as submarginal black spot lines disappear, being replaced to whitish yellow spot in male, red spot in female. The black spot in red marking at anal angle of hindwing, reduces to the slight patch. Ground colour golden yellow. The hereditary form appearing only in Akka district of the prefecture Iwate. Coreana stygiana BUTLER, f. hikosana nov. Underside, the marginal as well as submarginal black spot lines more distinct, inside of marginal black spot line, the whitish marking is parallel to it. Ground colour greyish yellow. The hereditary form appearing only in Mt. Hikosan (1200m.), northern Kyushu. Coreana stygiana BUTLER, semiakio nov. Two remarkable reddish markings appear in marginal areas of the spaces 2 & 3 in hindwing of upperside. Collected in Mt. Daisen (1713m.), the prefecture Tottori. by the author. Above-mentioned all types in author's collection.

N2  - Two instances of "bathing" by butterflies are recorded. 1) a, probably spent, Argynni paphia (Nymphalidae) dipped into the heart of a small pond (ca. 150 sq. m.), took "bathe", and flied away into the bush beyond, at p.m. 2.26, Sept. 28, 1958, in Kanazawa-city (Mr. AKIRA TAKETO reported). 2) a seemingly perfect ♂ Papilio xuthus, while having sailed across a brookiet (ca. 15m. wide), suddenly dived into the water as deep as 1 cm. with V-formed wings, skipped up and dipped again five times, until it reached safely to the opposite side, in the afternoon of June 16, 1962, in Mie-prefecture (Mr. MAKOTO MATSUURA reported). The causes for such behavior are to be investigated.

N2  - Although the Peacock Pansy, Precis almana, is fairly plentiful in most of the Loochoo Isl. and its range extends north to Tanegashima, it was regarded as one of the migrant species in Kyushu. Since 1958, however, there has been a remarkable increase in its numbers in the southern part of Kyushu. The present paper is devoted to show the annual life cycle of this species in this newly recognized habitat. As shown in the table, there are three to five generations in a year and some adults of the autumn generations which emerge chiefly in October pass the winter without diapause. But there is also a little possibility that a few larvae can survive to the next spring. The larvae feed on Lippia nodiflora L. C. RICHARD (Verbenaceae) all the year round and on Lindernia vervenaefolia PENNELL (Scrophulariaceae) from July to December.

N2  - Seventeen eggs were obtained from a Papilio xuthus female, which was hand-paired with P. maackii male on September 7, 1962. One of these eggs started to develop and hatched. This larva grew by a usual developmental rate and reached its 5th instar stage on September 26. The larva stoped to feed probably at the end of this stage, but did not become prepupa, and died after two months 5th instar stage. It is presumed that this larva did not have an ability to pupate. Phellodendron amurense was used as its larval food. The hybrid larva was intermediate between the parental species from its 1 st to 4th instar. The 5th instar larva resembled maackii very closely, although xuthus characters were seen in a few points.

N2  - Papilio maackii raddei ab. paki nov. Hindwing, upperside, central bluish green band as well as marginal crescent bluish green markings, extremely extend, so fuse together, also marginal reddish markings become very large. Underside, central yellow band and marginal red-purplish crescent markings very spread, so almost fuse each other. Hab. Kwangnung (Middle Korea) Apatura ilia substituta BUTLER. Hitherto, it was believed that substituta of Japan is equal to one of Korea, but in consequence of my scrutinizing, it became clear that both are to be distincted exactly. Both types (typical, and nigrescent) of Korea are larger or broader than those of Japan in orange or white markings of interspaces 1&2 of forewing, and in central orange or white band of hindwing, upperside. So I think that the name substituta should not be used exactly in the Japanese Apatura. Rather the name mikuni is to be adopted as the Japanese race. Apatura ilia substituta f. kwangnsnga nov. ♂♀ Upperside, hindwing, darkish dand containing the pupillated marking in interspace 2 nearly disappear. The very light form, somewhat resembles to here. Hab. Kwangnung (Middle Korea). Neptis raddei BREMER Neptis tshetverikovi KURENZOV Neptis Speyeri STAUDINGER Above-mentioned three species are at first recorded from the Middle Korea (Kwangnung). Especially here, the female of raddei is described. Neptis rivularis peninsularum MURAYAMAPsninsularum (Trans. Lep. soc. Jap., 11(2), 1960) is valid name, because N. coenobita (=rivularis) koreana SORE (1934) is preoccupied by N.pryeri coreana ESAKI et NAKAHARA, 1929. Favonius yuasai coreensis subsp. nov. In this time, this species is at first recorded from Korea. It differs from the Japanese specimens in the following points; Somewhat smaller, whitish scales in outer margin of interspaces 2, 4, 5, 6 of hindwing, underside, very conspicuous. Gronnd colour of underside more or less darkish. Hab. Kwangnung (Middle Korea) Favonius ussuriensis MURAYAMA The specimens from Ussuri were illustrated in "New Entomologist" 7 (4) :6. This species is very similar to F. latifasciatus, but the metallic green on upperside of male deep bluish (in latifasciatus golden green). Male genitalia, brachia becomes bold near the base, inside of valva, the former tip curved inside becomes saw-shaped chitinous matter, in the middle part, bears the crescent shaped chitinous matter. In this time 3♂♂ 1♀ are at first recorded from the Middle Korea (Kwangnung). Quercusia fujisana latimargiana subsp. nov. Male, upperside, marginal black band of both wings distinctly broader than the typical form. Underside, in both wings, area between the base and darkish brown band outside of discocellulars is very dark. Apex of forewing darker. Female, underside same as male, darkish brown band outside of discocellulars broader than male. Hab. Northern Kyushu (Mt. Hikosan. Mt. Homanzan, Mt. Inugadake, Mt. Sangunzan.) Japan. Glaucopsyche teleius daisensis ab. yoshisakai nov. Male, upperside, central black spot lines of both wings perfectly extinct, in the female remarkably educe. Hab; Mt. Daisen, Tottori pref., Japan. Cupido argiades seitzi ab. tukagutii nov. Female, this form lacks perfectly tails in hindwing. Hab; Kobe, Japan. Lycaeides argus micrargus ab. chiyodaensis nov. Male, underside, in both wings, outer submarginal black spot line and the red marking line spread conspicuously, inner submarginal black spot line perfectly evanishes. Hab; Yamagata, Japan. Zizeeria maha argia ab. kanonis MATSUMURA This female is an aberrant form very similar to ab. kanonis MATSUMURA. Hab. Hikone, Japan.

N2  - The Tokara Islands are located in the southernmost part of Japan, between KytlsbtI and the Loochoo Islands, and many zoogeographical subjects are there. One of the authors made an expedition to these islands during May and June in 1962, and collected nineteen species of butterflies. They are listed in this paper with some comments. The records previously reported are also reviewed from the literatures. Though the materials are scanty, the butterfly fauna of the Tokara Islands, especially of the Takara Islet, seems to be similar to that of the Amami Islands.

N2  - A female, Luehdorfja japonica, which had yellowish brown sphragis, was collected at Nagano-pref. Japan in May, 1961. It is pressumed that this sphragis was formed by a male of L. puziloi, because a sphragis of japonica is black and that of puziloi is yellowish brown. Eighty five eggs were obtained from this female and most of the eggs hatched. Larvae were reared on Heterotropa takaoi and 28 pupae were obtained. Yellow spots appeared on mature larvae as in L. puziloi. Four male and 10 female butterflies emerged in March, 1962. These butterflies show the intermediate expressions concerning 4 major differences between japonica and puziloi. Therefore, it is certain that these butterflies are F_1 hybrids between the two species

N2  - In the present paper, we describe two new Nymphalid, one new Pierid subspecies, two unrecorded Lycaenid and Papilio female of the Formosan Rhopalocera; Gonepteryx amintha meiyuanus nov. is the intermediate form between amintha formosana and mahaguru taiwana, namely forewing of upperside being not orange, but yellow as hindwing. Outer margin of hindwing is somewhat dentate as taiwana. Tacoraea cama zoroastres ab. pseudomelas nov. is the nigrescent form, corresponding to T. selenophora laela ab. melas MURAYAMA. In "Tyo to Ga" Vol. XI, pt. 2, p. 32, I corrected that melas is not the aberrant form of laela, but one of zoroastres. However, this correction is error, so it is still right that melas belongs to Iaela. Doleschallia bisaltide is recorded at first in this time, from Formosa, and distinguished as the new race koshunensis, from ssp. iwasakii of Okinawa, in having broader costal band on forewing of upperside, and darkish brown inner half area on both wings of underside. Euthalia thibetana uraiana ssp. nov. which is northern race of Formosa, has more round wings and broader central band on both wings of upperside than ssp. insulae HOLL. The female of Chrysozephyrus yuchingkinus MURAYAMA et SHIMONOYA recorded at first here, is O-form. Its white band on both wings as well as white scaled marginal band of underside, are more distinct than the male. Tails of both sexes are much long. The first female of Iphiclides chungi anus MURAYAMA is recorded here, the wings are more round and larger, marginal as well as submarginal band of both wings much broader than the male

N2  - All materials dealt in the present paper, were sent by Mr. YU CHING KIN and Mr. WEISOU CHUNG to whom we must express sincerely many thanks. Salatura yuchingkini sp. nov. ♀ In appearance, this species has intermediate characters, between Limnas chrysippus and Salatura genutia. Upperside forewing, white markings in apex area very resembles chrysippus. All veins of both wings are brownish black as in genutia, but not so bold. Underside, apex area yellowish pale, reddish ground colour of both wings yellowish orange as chrysippus, not so deep as genutia. Genitalia valva strong chitinous, large and slender, having the curved hook projection at the lower edge. Tacoraea eupolia sp. nov. ♂ The arrangement of all markings in both wings, upperside as well as underside, is nearly the same as selenophora laela ♀, but each marking more developed, white markings of interspaces 1 & 2 in hindwing somewhat yellowish. Genitalia, valva somewhat large, sacculus not so constricted, laciniate projections on the board like projection very distinct. Salpinx leucostictos botelianus ssp. nov. ♀ Differs from the Formosan mainland race hobsoni in having very reduced purple markings, marginal white spot band in hindwing of holotype nearly disappears. Ochiodes siva yuchingkina ssp. nov. ♂ In this time, the species siva is at first recorded from Formosa. The semitransparent marking in interspace 3 of forewing on upperside larger, marking on discocellular of forewing is エ shaped. Underside, markings in interspace 3 of forewing, interspaces 2 & 3 of hindwing larger than the original race from Naga Hills. The marking on discocellular of forewing splits in two small spots in Ochiodes subhyalina formosana. Papilio dialis andronicus ab. neotatsuta, nov. ♂ Extremely beautiful aberrant form. Hindwing on underside as tatsuta NAKAHARA (Zephyrus, 9. (2) 1, p1. 5,) but on upperside bearing the wide purplish red crescent markings in interspaces 1, 2, 3 & 4, the wide purplish blue crescent markings in interspace 6 near outer margin, in interspace 5 mixing blue and red colours. Hypolimnas bolina kezia ab. yokoojii NOMURA ♀ Hitherto no examples have been found except for the type specimen, so our material is the second example from Formosa. Polyura eudamippus formosana ab. eclepsis nov. ♂ Both wings on upper-and underside, are hazed by dark purplish veil, yellowish ground colour becomes grey on upperside, leaden gray on underside. Sumalia dudu jinamitra ab. neojina nov. ♂ White bands of both wings much reduced, the white markings in interspaces 4, 5, 6 of forewing, in interspaces 6,7 of hindwing vanished. Cyrestis thyodamas formosana ab. ambustus nov. ♂ Very remarkable nigrescent form. There are some light parts only in interspaces 1, 2, 3 of forewing. Crastia godarti garampiana MURAYAMA (comb. nov.) In "TyO To Ga" (Tran. Lep. Soc. Jap.), 11 (4) : 56, this race was belonged to the species core, but it is more fitting that garampiana is attached to godarti. In this time, the male is at first recorded from Formosa. Euthalia formosana FRUHST. ab. nugatoris MURAYAMA The type (Tyo To Ga, 11(4) : 58, f. 26) was very worn, so here the complete specimen ♀ is illustrated. Papilo polytes pasikrates FRUHST. ab. gynaiensis nov. ♂ Underside of hindwing, submarginal red markings extend inside and fuse with white markings. Papiliio polytes pasikrates FRUHST. ab. baikeiensis nov. ♀ Upperside of hindwing, submarginal markings, as well as red markings at anal angle, in the base of interspaces 1 & 2, of normal female form almost turn white. Vanessa indica HERBST ab. horishana NIRE Hitherto no examples except the type 4 have been recorded. in this time 5 specimens (1♂4♀) were examined. Sasakia charonda ssp. Many specimens of the Formosan race were found in this time. Very similer to coreana LEECH, but differs from it in having much larger white markings in the central area on hindwing of upperside.

N2  - Mycalesis gotama is a relatively common satyrid butterfly in Japan, and classified into two subspecies: subsp. fulginia and subsp. madjicosa. The former is found in southern Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu and has no obvious seasonal and geographical variations; while the latter in the Amami and the Loochoo Islands and has both seasonal and geographical variations. These two subspecies are easily distinguished in many respects. The specimen caught by the author at Satacho, Kagoshima Prefecture, southernmost Kyushu, is, however, characterized as the intermediate between these two subspecies. Two speculations are possible on the occurrence of the intermediate : one is that this specimen is a hybrid of inter-subspecies, subsp. fulginia and subsp. madjicosa, and the other is that subsp. madjicosa is contiguous to subsp. fulginia and is an example of "cline" phenomenon.

N2  - Popation usually takes place on the surface of trunk of a ailanthus-tree on which the larval life is completed. However, the popae are often found on the surface of electric pole or wall of house. There were two major peaks of distribution of cocoons, and they occured at about the same height on each surface of ailanthus-tree and electric pole. Analyses of variance showed that the differences in the number of pupae between the surface-sections of trunk were insignificant. The biological observations on the larval stages of Parallelia arctotaenia GUENEE were carried out from 1960 to 1961 in Kyoto. Populations of this moty throughout the rose fields and gardens of Kinki district have become increased since 1958. The results of research are as follows: (1)Female moths lay eggs singly on the underside of young leaves. (2) Young larvae to 2nd instar feed on the underside of leaves, remaining the upper cuticle, and rest near the feeding places or on the main veins and petioles of leaves. Older larvae, however, eat through the leaf, mostly remaining the main vein and rest on the stems in the shade by days. Mature larvae make cocons and pupate in the soil or under the fallen leaves. (3) The majority of larvae have 5 moultings while oassing through 6 instars, but in male rarely 5 instars. Larval duration is about 17 days (Table 1). (4) From the day of hatching the largest width of head capsule of each larva was measured once a day with ocular micrometer (Table 2). It is possible to determine the instar of a larva by the measurement of the head width. (5) Larvae eat about 20 leaves to complete their development and the greatest amount of food was consumed by the last larval instar (Table 3). The relation between the larval instar (x) and the feeding area of leaf (y) is shown by the following formula: log y=0.84+0.56x. (6) Three to four generations occur in a year; hibernation in the pupal stage. Some puparia of 3rd generation overwintered and gave rise to adults in the following May-June (Table 4).

N2  - Fundamental differences which separate species have been studied in interspecific hybrids of Japanese and North American Papilio at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, U. S. A. in 1957 and at Nanzan University, Japan from 1958 to clarify a process of differenciation of species. Namely affinity of species has been surveyed through egg fertility, percentage of larval formation within egg shell, hatchability etc. of interspecific hybridizations and fertility of interspecific hybrids. Genetics of visible characters which separate species has also been studied. An outline of the obtained results is presented here as a preliminary report. All matings were performed by handpairing and eggs were obtained under fluorescent light. Cages of about 30 cm. cube were used for the rearings of larvae. Egg fertility, hatchability etc. of palyxenrs × "brucei", hippocrates × "brucei" and polyxenes x hippocrates are as high as intraspecific mating, From a pair of polyxenes female × "brucei" male, 78 males and 1 gynandromorph were obtained. From two pairs of the reciprocal crosses, 10 males and 20 females were obtained. Male pupae of them, which pupated in summer, emerged next spring after overwintering, but females of the same brood emerged during the same summer. These differences may due to an abnormal inheritance of voltine differences between "brucei" and polyxenes. These F1 hybrids resembled polyxenes and were fertile. From three pairs of hippocrates× "brucei", 3 females and 2 males were obtained. The appearances were intermediate of the parents. From a pair of hippocrates × polyxenes, 6 males, 3 females, and 1 gynandromorph were obtained. The adults resembled polyxenes. In xuthus × hippocrates, polyxenes, and "brucei", most of the eggs were fertilized and about half of the eggs were hatched. The adults obtained were all males and small. The number of adults obtained were respectively 29 (intermediate) from 11 pairs, 10 (resemble polyxenes) from 3 pairs, and 5 (intermediate) from 1 pair. Umbelliferae and Rutaceae were used as their larval food. In xuthus × protenor, helenus, macilentus, and memnon, eggs were obtained from more than several pairs in each kind. Egg fertility and hatchability etc. were very low in general. The larvae reached the end of the 3rd instar in the best case (xuthus × macilentus). In xuthus × bianor and maackii, egg fertility and hatchability etc, were very low and the larvae died respectively in the 1st and 2nd instar. Egg fertility of a pair of glaucus × xuthus were very high, but only one larva hatched and it reached pupal stage and died. In protenor × helenus (5 pairs), polytes × protenor (1 pair), and polytes × helenus (1 pair), most of the eggs were fertilized and more than half of the eggs were hatched. The number of adults obtained were respectively 15 (intermediate), 4 (intermediate), and 18 (resemble polytes) and all were males. From memnon × helenus, macilentus x memnon, and macilentus × protenor, 2 pupae, one pupa, and one 5th instar larva were obtained respectively. From a pair of bianor × maackii, two males were obtained and they were intermediate of the parental species. Two fertile eggs were obtained from bianor × troilus, but they did not hatch. Crossing of bianor × helenus seems entirely infertile. P. xuthus may not be a typical member of the P. machaon group, but it is also not close to "P. protenor" group. Affinity within the "P. protenor" group is not so high as affinity within the typical P. machaon group. HALDANE'S rule is applied for interspecific hybrids between P. xuthus and the P. machaon group and between P. helenus and P. protenor or P. polytes. Egg fertility and hatchability etc. are highly variable in each crossing of a same kind. Therefore, many crossing must be performed to obtain a general egg fertility and hatchability etc. in one kind of interspecific hybridization. Food plants of interspecific hybrids must be studied in comparison with natural food plants and semi-forced food plants in captivity of the parental species. There is a possibility of an existence of natural interspecific hybrids of Papilio in Japan.

N2  - In this paper the author has described in detail several examples of homcotic aberration as seen in Japanese butterflies, and given consideration to the origin of the aberration on the basis of their analysis. A particular period might well be found in the process of wing development in butterflies where some kind of irregularity can cause homosis, and it has so far been considered very likely that this kind of aberration has its origin in as early as the embryonic period of the insect. Homosis appearing on the butterfly wing is unexceptionally limited to a portion of one side of any of the four wings, in so far as the examples shown here as well as those illustrated elsewhere are concerned. Consequently, it does not seem to be accompanied by any point, line or plane symmetry. In this respect the homeotic specimens of butterflies are in marked contrast to those already known of other insects. The following three facts have been obtained by examining those butterflies' homceotic patterns in the light of (a) the hypothetical wing venation of primitive insect, (b) the wing tracheation of the butterfly pupa and (c) the adult wing venation:- 1) Where the number of the homologous veins does not greatly vary in any of the above- mentioned three phases a, b and c, as in the medio-cubital area, a sizable portion of the wing pattern of one wing is completely reproduced on the same side of the other wing; 2) Where the phases a and b greatly differ in the fore and hind wings of the phase b and that difference is carried over into the phase c, as in the costo-radial area, no shifting of patterns can be observed; and 3) Where the phases a and b are identical and a change in venation takes place only in the phase c, as in the anal area, the pattern shifting is subject to distortion and partial absence. Those features are particularly well represented in the specimens of Neptis and Vanessa. It may safely be concluded, then, that homoeosis occurring on butterfly wings is a very interesting phenomenon whose cause may be traced back to the embryonic period, amalgamating the characteristics of the butterfly wing venation and the peculiarity of the wing bud development in insects undergoing internal wing formation. However, satisfactory interpretation cannot be given in this way to all of the more complicated specimens considered to be homoeotic, and the induction of a generalized rule on butterfly homoeosis will require a more careful study of a greater number of such examples.

N2  - 1. This paper is an attempt to interpret the morphology of the part of the cranium of the larval arid adult Lepidoptera. 2. It introduced the theories of SNODGRASS, HINTON, SHORT, and DUPORTE, regarding the frontoclypeal area of the lepidopterous larvae and adults. Among those, the SHORT'S theory was most useful for the propulsion of the author's theory, that is, what transformations on the lraval cranium will occur after the imagination. 3. This transformations of the cranium originated from following facts. (a) The disappearance of the mandibular muscles : (b) The absorbance into the adult tentorium of the area of outerside frontal inflection together with the part of attachment of the antennal muscles on the larval cranium : (c) The locomotion of position of the antennae: (d) The development to the adult compound eyes from the ocellar area of the larva: (e) The formation of the sucking pump results in the development of the frontoclypeal area: (f) And the development of the braium as shown in Fig. 10.

N2  - In this paper, the author discussed the basic problems on the phylogeny of psychid-moths from the point of views of comparative morphology and ethology. If we intend to have correct understanding of the phylogenetical relation and the factors of evolution, we must investigate the comparative studies on the habits besides the studies of comparative morphology. The author mainly investigated the degeneration of the body structures and differentiation of the habits of adult females of psychid-moths. Females of psychid-moths in Japan are separable into four groups morphologically and ethologically. α-group: Wings and legs are well-developed and functional. Having very long apophyses anteriores and posteriores, female can stretch her ovipositor long. At emergence, female pupa moves toward the posterior opening of the larval case, protrudes the anterior half of the body, then the adult insect emerges. Adult female is a rather moveless creature and often does not leave the larval case. Female lays eggs in the slits on rock and mosses, or sometimes in the larval case. Japanese genera belonging to the α-group are Diplodoma and four undescribed genera, one of which is very closely related to Narychia. β-group: Wings are degenerated into a minute membranous process which has no wing veins. Therefore, this organ completely lacks the function of flight. Legs are well-developed but short and the function of walking is extremely reduced. Female slowly climbs up and down on the lateral side of the larval case, or only hangs at the posterior opening of the case. At emergence, female pupa moves toward the posterior opening of the case from which she protrudes the anterior half of her body, and the adult insect emerges. Adult female does not leave her larval case, and rests on the lateral side of the case until male comes to copulate. After copulation female inserts her ovipositor into the slit between the larval case and protruded pupal skin, and lays eggs in the case. Japanese genera belonging to the β-group are Taleporia, Solenobia and an undescribed genus. γ-group: Wings are degenerated into a minute membranous process which has no wing veins. Therefore, this organ completely lacks the function of flight, or it is completely obliterated. As the legs are short and lack the function of walking, female hardly hangs at the posterior opening of the larval case. As apophyses anteriores and apophyses posteriores are very long, the stretched length of ovipositor is the longest among all the groups. At emergence, female pupa does not protrude the anterior half of her body from the posterior opening of the larval case. Therefore, the adult female molts in the larval case, then comes out of the case. In the subgroup γ_1, adult female completely draws out herself from the case, while in the subgroup γ2, the female draws her body untill the sixth or seventh abdominal segment is protruded out of the case, therefore the posterior extremity of body is hidden in the case. After copulation, female inserts her ovipositor into the posterior opening of the larval case, and fills the empty pupal skin in the case with eggs, Japanese genera belonging to the γ-group are Fumea, Proutia, Bruandia and Bacotia. δ-group: Wings are completely obliterated. Legs are degenerated into the minute simple process which is lacking the terminal claws. In some genera, the degenerated legs still retain incomplete segmentation. Ovipositors degenerated into a knob-like process, and apophyses anteriores and apophyses posteriores are very short, thus making the ovipositor unstretched. At emergence, female pupa does not move toward the posterior opening, therefore the adult female molts in the larval case. Female often protrudes the anterior half of her body from the posterior opening of the case. At copulation, male inserts his abdomen into the posterior opening of the female case, and stretches the abdomen between the pupal skin and adult female. Japanese genera belonging to the δ-group include Clania, Oiketicoides, Canephora Nipponopsyche and some other genera. As the result of the comparative ethology and morphology of psychid-moths, the author came to the conclusion that the degeneration of body structures and the differentiation of habits have taken place in the order of α→β→γ→δ, which are represented respectively by the above mentioned groups at present. Ancestors of psychid-moths might have destined to or had the inevitability for the degeneration of body structures and the differentiation of habits. This phenomenon is found in the case-bearing habit in the larval stage, the slit-ovipositing habit of the female, degeneration of mouth parts and the maturity of eggs in the pupal stage. Under these conditions, adult females might have got such a habit that they lay eggs in the larval cases. The change of ovipositing habit might have made females stay on their larval cases, then necessity of flight for locomotion might have lowered. Under the disuse condition of wings, this organ might have degenerated. Habit of egg-laying into the larval case might have strengthened by the attachment of females to the larval case, then walking function of legs also might have reduced and females have got the resting habit hanging at the posterior openings of the case. On the other hand, degeneration of organs for locomotion might have brought the increasing of egg laying capacity in the body cabity, and further possibly caused the reduction of function of locomotion in pupal stage, thus the female pupae lost their primitive habit of out-case emergence. Step to the δ-stage might have occurred as the result of the disuse of legs. At the stepping period, the females with well-developed legs might have changed their hanging habit, and after emergence, females might have not grasped the case but only protruded down the anterior half of their bodies from the posterior opening of their cases. Following the change of resting habit, legs of adult females might have set to the degeneration and lost terminal claws. The above explanation is supported by the presence of rudimentary legs and the protruding habit of adult females. Shortening of ovipositor might also followed after the changing of the habit. Phenomenon of the degeneration of body structures and the differentiation of habits might have been attained in various liniages. Therefore, the species of the same stage of evolution must also exist in various liniages at present. For instance, Diplodoma, Narychia (α-group), Solenobia, Eosolenobia, Taleporia, and Bankesia (β-group) compose a natural group. Among these genera, the ventral process of valvae of male genitalie is simple, spiny and lacking numerous mintue processes and the larval cases are trigonal in section. In this generic group, four former genera are very closely allied to each other in possessing fultura inferior on diaphragma of the male genitalia and naked seventh abdominal terga of females. Two latter genera have not those characters. Therefore, the ancestors of this group might have differentiated into at least two liniages in the α-stage, then step to the β-stage occurred independently on each liniage respectively. Taking into consideration of the differences of ontogeny, body structures and habits, the author could find a phase of psychid-phylogeny which may support the following explanation of the process of degeneration of wings, legs and ovipositors. In the first, the disuse of these organs occurred on the results of the change of habits which are caused by the inevitability of life, then the function of the organs decreased and finally the organs are degenerated.

N2  - The evolution of feeding-habits of larvae of the Thecline butterflies was considered collectively by the following points. 1) Food-plants for larvae of respective known species in nature. 2) Food-plants with which larvae can be reared for their whole instars in the laboratory, but the plants never recognized as food in nature. 3) Phylogenetical relationships among genera of the butterflies given by T. SHIROZU and H. YAMAMOTO (1957). According to my consideration, a supposed ancestral form of the Thecline butterflies might have been a Fagaceae-feeder, and this feeding-habits are wide spread among the living Thecline genera. The other feeding-habits on the Oleaceae, Rosaceae, Juglandaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Betulaceae, Ericaceae and some aphids among the living Thecline species may be the results of secondary changes from the Fagaceae. In the course of differentiation of the Thecline butterflies, the changes of feeding-habits to the Oleaceae might have been evolved in an earlier period, and such habits are preserved in Ussuriana, Coreana. Artopoetes, etc.

N2  - Iphiclides alebion tayal SHIROZU, subsp. nov. (Figs. 1-7) This new subspecies is a distinct insular race found in Formosa. The following two characters are most important in separating this new subspecies from the nominate one. 1) On upperside of hindwings, the blackish area occupying the posterior part of hindwings is much larger and more strongly enlarged basally than in the nominate race; space 3 almost blackish except for basal small pale area in this new race, while in the nominate race basal half of the space occupied by pale yellowish white ground colour, on which the median black band is passing; tornal orange patch in space 2 much reduced and the distal margins of the patches of spaces 1 and 2 almost in the same level, therefore black eye spot in space 1 connected with blackish area of space 2, while in the nominate race the orange patch in space 2 longer than that in space 1 and outer margin of the former patch situating more distally than that of the latter one, therefore blackish eye spot completely separated from the black area of space 2 by the orange patch. 2) In the new race, 8th blackish band on forewings counted from the wing base running through on the point where veins 7 and 8 are conjointed, while in the nominate race the band passing through on space 7 much more distal part from the point. Length of forewings: 34-38mm (♂). Habitat: N. Formosa (Vicinity of Urai). Holotype ♂, paratopotypes 4♂♂, Vicinity of Urai, N. Formosa, April 1961, CHING KIN YU leg.

N2  - 1. A comparative study of the external charaters of the alimentary canal in 11 species of moths belonging to 8 families was carried out. 2. Among the components of the alimentary canal, the mesenteron was found to be variable interspecifically in its external appearance. 3. With respect to the external appearance of the alimentary canal, in most species studied it seems to be of specific characters. Moreover, it seems to exist the characters of higher categories: genera, families and superfamilies. 4. In general, the data obtained from the present study coincided with the taxonomic system used by entomologist.

In the various components of the alimentary canal, special attention was paid to the structural differences of the masenteron between the Libytheidae and the Hesperiidae. 3. With respect to the external characters of the alimentary canal, (a) L. celtis is closely related to some of the Hesperiidae, and apparently differs from the Nymphalidae. (b) Thus, L. celtis is considered to be of a primitive butterfly as well as the Hesperiidae.

N2  - In this paper, the author tried to point out that the geographical variations of Maculinea teleius (Lycaenidae, Lepidoptera) distributing from the foot of Mt. Fuji to mountains around the Kofu basin are remarkable especially in the coloration - perhaps these color variations are caused by no environmental factors but mutation - of uppersides of wings. According to his observation, those in mountains around the Kofu basin are generally colored by beautiful sky blue, on the contrary, the greater portion of ones in the foot of Mt. Fuji has darkly melanized coloration. The facts suggest that the historical process of their spreading is different between the both areas.

N2  - In my revision of the Japanese Orthosia published in 1955, I pointed out briefly that "Momma paromoea ssp. marginepicta BRYK is not an Orthosia but a member of the so-called "Caradrina-complex" (Athetis auct.) in the Amphipyrinae. My furthur study of the type, which was kindly sent me on loan, by the late Dr. F. BRYK reveals now that marginepicta must be sunk into Hoplodrina euryptera BOURSIN from Setzchwan, S. E. China. The synonymy is discussed above, and the distribution of euryptera thus ranges to N. Korea, where the type of marginepicta was taken, and also to Japan and Formosa, both of which are new localities recorded here.

N2  - In the present paper, we describe 2 new species, 1 new race, 1 new seasonal form, and 4 aberrant forms, of which seasonal as well as aberrant forms are published by Mr. CHUNG and MURAYAMA. The description of Favonius ussuriensis n. sp. allied to F. latifasciatus was already given in New Entomologist. Vol. 7, No. 4, p. 6. fig. 13〜16, 1958. Neptis rivularis peninsularum n. ssp. from Korea is smaller than ssp. magnata from Mongol, and differs from ssp. insularum from Honshu, in the point, that the ground colour of underside is more reddish brown and the white bands, spots are generally very distinct. Atella phalanta columbina f. nitens nov. is the autumn-winter form in Formosa. The purplish lustre of underside is strong and more beautiful. 4 aberrant forms of Formosan Neptis are all melanic forms. Tacoraea selenophora laela ab. melas described in "Tyo to Ga" Vol. X. Pt. 4, p. 67, is error of T. cama zoroastres ab. melas. Chrysozephyrus yuchingkinus MURAYAMA et SHIMONOYA sp. nov. (fig. 31) ♂. Very closely allied to Chrysczephyrus mushaellus MATS. , but differs from it in the following main points; (l) Upperside, darkish brown, being not metallic green as the male of general Chrysozephyrus and Neozephyrus, but bears the scattered green scales in discoidal cell of fore wing. (2) Underside, the white line of fore wing is exactly parallel with outer margin, the same of hind wing becomes V-shaped near anal angle, (not W-shaped as mushaellus.) (3) Somewhat smaller. Length of fore wing. 18mm. (4) Brachia of male genitalia very long and slender. Type 1 ♂ Poli (Central Formosa) August, 1958, Mr. Yu CHING KIN leg.

N2  - Chrysozephyrus ataxus is widely but locally distributed in southern parts of Japan, and is also known from Tsushima Island. The author collected the eggs of this species from that Island in the spring of 1958, and succeeded in having 10 males and 10 females of butterflies by breeding. Consequently he found the following difference between the specimens from Tsushima Island and those from other parts of Japan. Male: Upperside. Black margins of both wings are narrower, especially near the anal of the hind wing. Female: Upperside. Purple patch of the forewing is generally larger than that of subsp. kirishima-ensis OKAJIMA, but smaller than that of subsp. yakushimaensis YAZAKI. Underside; Markings are the same as those of other localities in both sexes.

N2  - A striking abnormal form of Catocala patala FELDER was illustrated here and compared with the typical one. It matches fairly well the specimen named ab. usuiensis SUGITANI (Akitu, 2: pi. 1, 1939) and is therefore the second example of this form found in Japan. On upper surface it has the median blackish band of the hindwing completely lost, remaining some amount of blackish scales on the vein 2, but on under surface this feature occurs parallelly to the forewing, in which instead of normal median band a dark speck on costa and a minute dark point at the upper angle of cell are marked. Normal in colour and in size of wings. ♂, Tokyo, 7. viii. 1958(S. SUZUKI). In the collection of the author.

Strymonidia inouei SHIRO.ZU (Fig. 5) Neallotype ♂, Puli (Horisha), Formosa, viii. 1957, In my collection, Length of forewing 15 mm., Expanse 25 mm. ♂ differs from ♀ in the following respects. 1) ♂ has a brand which is rather large size, about the centre of costal margin of forewings, having faint-coloured on the upperside and even darker than the groundcolour on the underside. 2) Reddish-orange spots near tornus are reduced. Virachola rapaloides NARITOMI comb. nov. (Figs. 6 & 7) Up to now, the unique specimen has been known to science since my original description (1941), as I have been keeping another ♂ specimen in my collection, I describe it as neallotype. The difference between ♂ and ♀ is as follows. Wing shape. Producing of outer margin of hindwings at the end of vein 3 and vein 7 is equal in both ♂ and ♀, while in ♂ forewings is narrower, apex produced, and tornus makes right angle. On the other hand ♀ has broader round shape. Upperside. Groundcolour of ♀ is uniformly dark brown, and ♂ is about the same but with an exception. In ♂, the difference is a few purple patches which occupy both at whole cell and inner two thirds of space 1 in forewings, and the area between vein 2 to vein 7 in hindwings. Only ♂ hat a small dark brown brand near the base of hindwings above. Underside. Groundcolour of both sexes is greyish white, but ♂ is darker. Discocellular and median bands of both wings are broad, but narrower width in 8 , darker than groundcolour, and edged by the slender white lines. Length of forewings ♂17mm., ♀19mm.; Expanse ♂29mm., ♀33mm. Neallotype ♂, Puli (Horisha), Formosa, 30. viii. 1943, Col. F. TASHIRO ; ♀(Holotype), Noko, Formosa, viii. 1940,; In my collection.

N2  - Cranionycta DE LATTIN was established in 1949 for a single species oda from Sutchanski-Rudnik, which is characterized by the closely Craniophora-like pattern of forewing, combined with uncrested abdominal segments, and more essentially by the structure of male genitalia which show very simple, elongate valva with completely missing harpe. Two more species having the similar type of valva are later described in 1950 by KOZHANTSHIKOV and DRAUDT, for both of whom it was unfortunate that DE LATTIN'S paper appeared too late to make reference. I consider that transversa KOZH. may very probably be a synonym of oda described from nearly the same locality, but another one inquieta DRAUDT seems to be separated from oda by its smaller size of expanse and somewhat dissimilar appearance of forewing, leaving for future study a slight possibility that it could be the Chinese race of oda. There is before me a pair of Cranionycta species collected in Japan by Mr. Y. YAMAMOTO (Hyonosen, 23. VI. 1957) who kindly sent me his interesting specimens for identification. I have now concluded them to be undoubtedly oda, by the kind help of Prof. Dr. GUSTAF DE LATTIN of Zoologisches Staatsinstitut in Hamburg, who generously provided me with a photograph of the types oda, shown first here in fig. 1, and to whom I express my best appreciation. The synopsis of the genus will be appended above. The association of Miracopa prodigiosa DRAUDT with this genus was already mentioned by BOURSIN (1952).

N2  - A Hesperiid butterfly which is little known to the fauna of Japan was newly collected at Amami-Oshima, Amami Group, the southernmost archipelago of Japan, by Mr. KAIYA KUBO as follows: Parnara naso bada MOORE, 1878 1♀, Nase, Amami-Oshima, Japan, 22. vii. 1957. This is the first record of the species from Japan excluding the Loochoos, except one female specimen from "Japan" in the British Museum recorded by EVANS in 1949, the data of which is rather dubious. This is also the northernmost record of the species within its wide distribution from Africa to Australia.

N2  - A new subspecies occuring in Central Formosa. This new subspecies, which is distinctly different from Ch. chrysolora as the well developing of the black spots on its both side of wings, is rather closely resembled Ch. ulupt morii occuring in Korea but is easily distinguished from it in the following respects. 1. On the wing shape, the apex of forcings is not prominent as morii, then the size is smaller. 2. In male, the dark brownish area of forewings is much broader and the colour is darker. Furthermore, at space 4, this new one appears a black oblique band which is absent in morii. The series of black spots on the outer part of hindwings are remarkably extended, especially near hindwings beneath the black space is wider. 3. In female, the white band of upperside is much broader and is neither separated by every black vein nor turning purple. Moreover on hindwings, the inner outline of this band is not distinct. Length of forewings: ♂ 59 mm, ♀ 71 mm. Habitat: Central Formosa. Holotype: ♂, Mt. Morrison, 23. vii. 1957; Allotype : ♀, Puli 4. vii. 1958; Paratypes: 4 ♂♂. Chitoria chrysolora, which has hitherto mostly been treated as a subspecies of Ch. ulupi DOHERTY, seemes to be entirely different species of ulupi as Mr. Le MOULT (1950) classified.

N2  - Egg: The shape is bucket-like, 0.5 mm in basic-diameter, 0.3mm in top diameter and 0.7mm in height. The color is grey. On its surface there run some rising lines perpendicular, nine or ten form the middle. There are also about fifteen side lines which meet at right angle with above lines. Egg stage occupies about six weeks and the larva hatches out between the end of November and the beginning of December. Larva: The larve grows till the middle of June. It passes fifth moult. The first instor larva spends the winter without eating and then eat Viola mandshurica W. BECK., when it's budding in next spring. Pupa: The colour is dark grey, but each has difference. The larva spins at the roots of a weed. The term of pupa is about 17〜25 days. Adult: It appears from the earlier part of June, conulating between the latter part of June and the earlier part of July. After estivating from the latter part of July, it appears again in the end of September. The egg is laid in October near Viola mandshurica W. BECK.

N2  - Aus Formosa war bisher Erynnis montanus BREMER noch nicht gefunden. Diesmal haben wir 2♂♂ in Sammel materialien, die von M. WATANABE in Sakai uns gegeben wurden, entdeckt. Weil diese Exemplars sich in folgenden Punkte von typischer Form unterscheiden, schlagen wir neuen subspezifischen Name vor.

N2  - The name of Parectopa pavoniella ZELLER was recorded for the first time in Japan by Dr. S. ISSIKI in the "Icon. Ins. Jap., ed. 2: 453, f. 1221" in 1950. Examining the specimen by his favour, the author came to know that the above one was quite different from the true one. On the other hand the author has some specimens of the same genus which were collected by him at Mt. Hikosan and the species is closely related to pavoniella ZELLER. Comparing the specimens with the European ones sent from Dr. E. M. HERING, of the Berlin Zoological Museum, the auther came to know that the specimens of the ought to be identified as the true pavoniella. In the present paper the author recorded not only the true species from Japan but also made mention of its life-history which was observed by him at Mt. Hikosan, N. Kyushu and added Aster scaber THUNBERG to the list of its host plant. According to the author's careful comparison, the Japanese race seems to differ slightly from the nominotypical one from Europe by the basal streak of the forewing reaching to the dorsal edge.

N2  - Up to date, the most lepidopterists has been paied no attention to the record of Takanea japonensis from Japan by Dr. N. MARUMO (1920). This insect is not valid species nor synonym with miyakei WILEMAN, and is a Japanese representative of Takanea excisa WILEMAN in Formosa. Excisa is closely allied to miyakei but the followings are the distinguishable points: The expances (in the neighborhood of 45mm) slightly larger than that of miyakei (35-40 mm); the ground colour more reddish brown ; the inner- and outer-line indistinct in the most cases. The distribution of excisa is Formosa, Kyushu, Shikoku and southern part of Honshu; while miyakei is in Hokkaido and northern part of Honshu. The mixed inhabitation of the two species may be expected in central part of Honshu, where both species miyakei and excisa have been captured.

N2  - Chrysozephyrus kirishimaensis yakushimaensis YAZAKI (1923) is one of the most rare butterflies in Japan and its life history had been unknown, because it inhabits only Yaku-Island, south of Kyushu. We had an opportunity to take some eggs of this butterflies last winter and breed them in Osaka. Unexpectedly the food plants are not Quercus acuta THUNB. as of subsp. kirishimaensis but Quercus stenophylla MAKING and Q. glauca THUNB. The egg is laid separately on the joint of the bud. The larva and pupa are very similar to subsp. kirishimaensis.

N2  - Euthalia malapana SHIROZU et CHUNG, sp. nov. (Figs, 1, 3, ♂; 2, 4, ♀) This new species most closely resembles Euthalia pratti LEECH, 1891 from Central and Western China, but in comparing with the original description and an accurate, fine figure of the latter shown by LEECH (Butt. China, Japan and Corea, pi. 21, fig. 5, ♀, 1892), the following differences are noticeable. 1) The whitish spots in spaces 6, 5 and 4, forming the central fascia of forewings, are placed more proximally, in consequence these spots (especially of space 4) are more closely situated near the end of the discoidal cell than in compared species. 2) In forewings, the whitish spot in space 4 is much larger than that of space 5, while in pratti those are in reverse. 3) In space Ib of forewings, two small longitudinal white spots are present in this new species, while in pratti they are entirely absent. 4) The central fascia on upperside of hindwings is broader in spaces 6 and 7, and narrowed more rapidly towards the posterior part than in compared species. Length of forewings: 50 mm (♀), 42 mm (♂). Habitat: Formosa. Holotype ♀, allotopotype ♂, Malapa near Musha, Central Formosa, 1. vii. 1957, Wensou Chung leg.

N2  - The Japanese races of Parasemia plantaginis (LINNE) are dealt with. One race, macromera (BUTLER), may be divided into two races, viz. the Hokkaido race and the Honsyu race. The other, japonica, was described by INOUE & KOBAYASHI (1956) from Central Honsyu, on the basis of the male specimen, and they treated it as a subspecies of P. plantaginis, but I have some question whether it justifies the treatment. In the actual state, the matter is not settled. The genitalia of each of the above Japanese races are quite indistinguishable, and also identical with those of the Central European race. Parasemia plantaginis (L.) ssp.? japonica INOUE et KOBAYASHI Tinea, 3 (1-2): 138, figs. 4, 5, & 6, 1956. A darker race than the others. Female (unrecorded) illustrated on fig. 18. 9 . Black ; sides of patagia, hairs of lateral areas of abdomen, anal tuft orange-yellow. Forewing with pale orange-yellow markings; an interrupted streak along submedian fold ; a spot on discocellulars; two posterior bands connected to each other. Hindwing with a subterminal orange-yellow band from just below costa to vein 2. One female was collected by Mr. A. MUTUURA at Kamikoti (alt. 1550m.), Central Honsyu, Japan, July, 21, 1951. Distribution: Japan (Honsyu).

N2  - Ussuriana michaelis takarana Allotype 1♂. (fig. 3, & 6) 15. Jan. 1956, Malapa, Taihori (2200m.), Central Formosa. Length of forewing : 24mm. W. CHUNG leg. In author's collection. Holotype 1♀, Paratype 1♀, 1941, ARAKI et HIRAYAMA, Mushi no Sekai (Insect World) vol. 4, No. 11-12, p. 1-2, Upperside, yellowish orange area on the forewing much smaller than the female. Hindwing almost black, with yellowish orange patch at anal angle. Antennae are lost. The male of this race is larger than that of original race from Korea (fig. 2 upperside, 5 underside), the tails also are longer, and the black spots of underside are all longer. Wagimo sulgeri insularis SHIROZU (fig.1 & 4) 1♂, Musha, Central Formosa, 1953 (Detailed date unknown.) Length of forewing: 13mm. W. CHUNG leg. In author's collection. It is expected that Mr. T. SHIROZU will publish the description of the new Formosan race of Wagimo sulgeri under the above-mentioned name in the near future. So I refrain to name the new race here, and give only the description. (While the proof of this paper is reading, Mr. SHIROZU'S description was published.) Upperside, the purplish marking on forewing larger, especially it projects towards the outer margin. Between this marking and outer margin, bearing the linear weak purplish markings in the interspaces 1, 2 and 3. The faint purplish marking in the discoidal cell on the hindwing. Underside, having large marking in the interspace 1 near anal angle on the forewing, both sides of this marking being gradated whitely. The whitish spot in Ib near or outer margin on the hindwing of the original race, but there are no spot in this new race. Size smaller than the original race. Tajuria karenkonis Allotype 1♂, 3, Aug. 1957, Usou, Taichung, Formosa. Length of forewing : 18mm. W. CHUNG leg. In author's collection. Holotype 1♀, 1929, MATSUMURA, Ins. Mats. vol. III, No. 2 & 3. Upperside, forewing bluish patch more deeper, and brilliant than ♀, extending completely to the tornus. Hindwing bluish area more extending to the costal margin.

N2  - Hitherto, Danaus lotis has not been known from Formosa, but recently some specimens were caught there by Mr. W. CHUNG, and as a result of my research, it became clear that the Formosan lotis agrees with the northern Philippines race edmondi. The Formosan lotis differs from the typical race lotis (Fig. 3) from Borneo in being more blackish brown on upperside of both wings. White markings except for submarginal as well as marginal ones on hindwing, more developed. Size s,omewhat larger. Very much allied to subsp. philozigetes FRUHS-TORFER (Fig. 2) from Philippines, but white markings somewhat developed, especially Ib and 2 interspaces of forewing, also 1b, 2, 3, 4, and 5 interspaces of hindwing distinctly larger. Examined specimens; 1♂ Jitsugetsutan, Central Formosa, 22. VII. 1956, Expanse of forewing,42mm., in author's collection. 1♂ (Fig. 1) Hori, Central Formosa, 21. VII. 1956, Expanse of forewing, 44mm., in Mr. MORI'S collection.

N2  - Here is written a note on Mods ancilla (WARREN), whose occurence in Japan has not been confirmed. I could fortunately obtain a unique male (Kobe, 9 May 1954, SUGI leg.) that has strikingly dissimilar genitalia to those of annetta and it was naturally identified with ancilla through the published description. It is a little smaller than the same brood of annetta, deeper purplish brown, the postmedian line more even and not sharply angled at vein 2, but the hindwing is rather less yellowish compared with the spring brood of annatta, which has markedly yellow terminal area. The male genitalia of the both species are shown. Ancilla may be found mainly in the western part of Japan, and seems to disappear in Tokyo and its neighboring area.

N2  - The author has studied Sineugraphe exusta BUTLER and two related species : disgnosta BOURSIN and longipennis EOURSIN based on many specimens. In addition to giving specific differences in general appearance and male genitalia, he has illustrated the feature of female genitalia of these 3 species as a means of specific discrimination. The local distribution of these moths are as follows : S. exusta : Hokkaido, Honsyu, Kyusyu.; S. disgnosta : Hokkaido, Honsyu, Sikoku, Kyusyu ; S. longipennis : Honsyu, Sikoku, Kyusyu. A new form of disgnosta has been also described by the author. Sineugraphe disgnosta BOURSIN f. boursini OGATA This is fairly separable from the typical form by fore wing with two black spots in cell : one of them being triangular, direct proximally to the orbicular, the other triangular or square between the reniform and the orbicular.

N2  - The object of this paper was to clarify the confusion that has existed for many years in the nomenclature and taxonomy of moths of the Genus Adoxophyes in Japan. The genera involved privatana, congruana, fasdculana and fasciata, and of these the first is known to the important pest of green-tea, and the second is known to the important pest of apple. But, result of revision, this four species does not seen necessary to separate generically. I believe I can now correctly identify this four species as a synonym of orana (F.R.).

N2  - The young stages of Melitaea diamina protomedia MENETRIES are similar to the other species' of the same genus, as the following: Eggs are upright and slightly tapering in shape, with a small depression on the blunt top and a flat base. There are about eighteen longitudinal keels, not reaching half-way up the side ; the spaces between the keels are smooth. Down the side, they are covered with a very coarse, slightly raised network. At first they are yellowish-white tinged with green, but as the caterpillar matures within, they become brownish-yellow. They are laid all in a batch, of 40-200, on the underside of the leaves of Patrima scabiosaefolia, in July. The caterpillars hatch out about 12〜14 days after the eggs are laid, and eat up their own eggshells from which they came a moment ago except the flat bases. Soon they form colonies corresponding to the number of eggs that hatch in any one batch, and then proceed to prepare a dwelling-place con-jointly by drawing together with silk two or three leaves of the food-plant, on which they feed until the supply is exhausted. They then immigrate in company to fresh leaves and construct a larger retreat, the better to accommodate their growing bodies. At the fifth instar, towards the mid-August, and while still quite small, they spin a silken home, hibernaculum, with two or three leaves, in which they go into hibernation on the silken carpet for the winter. The caterpillar in its first instar is brownish-yellow with light brown head, while as it repeats moulting its body with glossy black head gradually becomes dark, except its light brown underside.

N2  - Eurema brigitta CRAMER, a tropical Pierid butterfly, widely distributed in the African and Indo-australian Region, has not been found in Japan and its northern-most locality in eastern Asia was Formosa, so far as known up to present. In September and October, 1955, nine specimens (7♂♂2♀♀) in total of this species were collectd at Karatsu, North Kyushu, Japan, by Messrs. IZUMI MATSUSHITA and TOYOHEI SAIGUSA, and, moreover, one living pupa o>f the species was found on Cassia mimosoides LINNE, var. nomame MAKING (Papilionaceae) in the same habitat by Mr. T. SAIGUSA. Thus there is no doubt that the species was bred on Cassia in that locality at least in September and October, 1955. I compared these nine specimens (Figs. 1-9) with those of the Formosan subspecies, E. brigitta formosana MATSUMURA (Figs. 10-18), and found that they differ from each other in some respects. In formosana the colour of the fringe of both the wings is strongly pink-tinged in the cold-season form, seen frcm below, though not pink in the warm-season form. The nine specimens before me frcm Karatsu, Japan, are apparently representing the cold-season form judging from the degree of development of the black bordering on the upperside of wings and the collecting dates, but they are furnished with a fringe not pink. The black bordering of hindwings is strongly marked in the preapical part and suddenly narrowed towards the anal region from the middle of the space 5 and the brownish fasciae on the underside of wings are well developed in the cold-season form of the Formosan subspecies, while in the specimens from Japan, the black bordering is narrower and gradually tapering towards the anal region and the brownish fasciae are. less developed. Judging from the above mentioned facts, the specimens captured at Karatsu cannot be regarded as belonging to the Formosan subspecies, and must have been accidentally introduced (possibly by ship) into Japan from some locality in tropical Asia other than Formosa, unless it is proved to be the natives of Japan. It requires further investigations in order to elucidate this problem.

N2  - In October 1954 we had an opportunity to take a short trip to Satamisaki, the southernmost part of Kyusyu, and to take photographs of some life-forms of Hebomoia glaucipbe, the largest Pierid of Japan. The butterflies are tropical or subtropical and are distributed widely in the Oriental region. They are divided into several subspecies according to localities. Satamisaki is the northernmost district in which they live and they are represented there by subspecies liukiuensis FRUHSTORFER. The larvae live upon Crataeva religiosa and they repeat five life-cycles during the period from April to November in this district.

N2  - This paper deals with subspecies of Theclini in Japan enumerated below. 4. Antigius butleri butleri (FENTON, 1881) = Antigius butleri onomichianus MURAYAMA, 1954. syn. nov. in 1934 T. ESAKI stated that this form should be considered as a synonym of the original subspecies. In 1954 it was given subspecific rank by MURAYAMA and was considered as the subspecies of butleri from Honshu. According to the examination of the series avairable for study, it has become evident that this form was quite congeneric with the original species in Hokkaido because its characters were often found within the scope of individual variation. 5. Araragi enthea enthea (JANSON, 1875) = Araragi enthea yucara MURAYAMA, 1953. syn. nov. MURYAMA described yucara from Hokkaido as a new subspecies of enthea. According to an examination of many specimens, the subspecific characters given by MURAYAMA should be considered as individual variation. 6. Favonius jezoensis jezoensis (MATSUMURA, 1915) = Favonius jezoensis magnificans MURAYAMA, 1953. syn. nov. Jezoensis from Honshu was distinguished from the original species of Hokkaido by MURAYAMA, though the specimens from northern Honshu were lack in his study. A comparison of many specimens from various regions of Japan has shown that jezoensis from Honshu could not be separated the original. 7. Favonius cognatus cognatus (STAUDINGER, 1892) = Favonius cognatus jozanus MATSUMURA, 1915. syn. nov. Based on the original description of FIXEN, MURAYAMA considered jozanus MATSUMURA was the subspecies of ultramarinus from Hokkaido. In 1954 ESAKI has shown that the species called ultramarinus by Japanese authors was not the true ultramarinus, but cognatus STAUDINGER, based on an examination of the type in British Museum. Accordingly jozanus MATSUMURA, if it represents a good subspecies, is considered as a subspecies of cognatus. But a careful study of the series from Japan and Korea has revealed that cognatus in Japan had no subspecifiic divergency.

N2  - In the present paper the author has synonymized the following five subspecies. 1. Neozephyrus taxila japonicus (MURRAY, 1875) = Neozephyrus taxila monticola SHIROZU, 1952. syn. nov. Monticola was described by T. SHIROZU from material from the mountainous region of Central Honshu. But a careful study of many specimens has revealed that the characteristics of monticola agreed with those of the small form of japonicus. It should further be noted that the common form, japonicus, was already recorded from the original type locality of monticola in 1933. 2. Favonius saphirinus saphirinus (STAUDINGER, 1887) = Favonius saphirinus nipponicus MURAYAMA, 1953. syn. nov. = Favonius saphirinus jezonicus MURAYAMA, 1953. syn. nov. = Favonius saphirinus oseanus MURAYAMA, 1954. syn. nov. Separating from the continental original species, S. MURAYAMA devided Japanese Favonius saphirinus into three subspecies enumerated above. But an examination of many specimens from various regions of Japan has shown that the subspecific characters described by MURAYAMA were contained within the range of individual variation in the original species. 3. Neozephyrus aurorinus alpinus MURAYAMA, 1954. = Neozephyrus aurorinus kansaiensis MURAYAMA, 1954. syn. nov. Aurorinus from Honshu was distinguished from that of Hokkaido by MURAYAMA and was separated into two subspecies: the one from the northern part of the Chubu district and the other from the western part of the Kinki district. Based on a comparison of many specimens from various regions in Japan, I was led to synonymized kansaiensis because its characters given by MURAYAMA represent no subspecific divergency and should be considered as individual variation, though albinus was recognizable as a good subsnecies.

N2  - On 5th August, 1954, Mr. AKIO URATA collected a tropical Lycaenid, Pithecopis hylax (FABRI-Cius) at Sasuna-mura, Tsushima Islands, Japan. This is the first record of the species in Japan, and the discovery was entirely unexpected, as this locality is situated much further north from Okinawahonto of the Loochoos, the northernmost known locality of the species. He found more than ten specimens of this species in Cryptomeria-forest in a hill, and collected seven specimens, of which a male is shown here. Undoubtedly the species is native in the Tsushima Islands, and cannot be regard as a migrant species. The form from the Tsushima Islands may represent a new subspecies, but only a single specimen is available for me at present, and the establishment of a new subspecies must be postponed until more materials will be obtained.

N2  - In present paper, I recorded my breeding result that the so-called "Swell inch-worm on Ilex crenata THUMB." which had been described and misplaced in Nemoria by late Dr. Tadajiro Sasaki in his "Insects Injurious to Japanese Trees" (1899) was the larva of Rhynchobapia flaviceps BUTLER, and gived a full description on its pupal characters.

N2  - Anal comb of the Japanese Colias hyale poliographus Motsch, was described. The comb is transverse and consists of thirteen teeth. The tooth is elongate and obtuse at the apex; basal half fused with each other but free apically; every third tooth has a small process on a side which is fused at the base. The length of the teeth is subequal excepting those at each side of the comb which are shorter than terest. This is somewhat allied to the anal comb of C. philodice eurytheme Bdvl. from N. America, which was illustrated by Peterson, However, detailed comparison is impossible on account of his sketch being too rough.

N2  - 1. The present paper supports the Klots' opinion (1930) to distinguish Anthocharis Boisdvral from Euchtoe Hiibner. However the generotype of Euchloe Hbn. is not belia Cramer but esperi K rby according to Hemming (1934). The correct generic name for cardamines L. and scolymus Buler is Anthocharis Boisduval. 2. Scolymus Btlr. must be transferred from subgenus Falcapica Klots to Anthocharis (s. str.) because of close resemblances with cardcmines L. in male genitalia and in type of pattern. The wing shape can not be worth good r ason of subgeneric separation at least in this case. 3. Distributions of Anthocharis-species in Japan are mentioned in the text.
