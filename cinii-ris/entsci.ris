N2  - We investigated the prey-predator relationship between aposematic pyrrhocorid bugs, Antilochus coqueberti and Dysdercus cingulatus. They are similar in appearance and often found in the same habitat simultaneously. Carnivory of A. coqueberti on D. cingulatus and D. decussatus was observed in the field, and A. coqueberti could not develop when experimentally fed on only plant materials, strongly indicating the obligate carnivory of A. coqueberti. While A. coqueberti did not prey on bugs in the families Lygaeidae, Largidae, Coreidae, and Rhopalidae that share the aposematic body coloration with A. coqueberti and D. cingulatus, A. coqueberti preyed on all the pyrrhocorids and alydids provided, regardless of their body coloration. Visual resemblance is only partially involved in the prey preference of A. coqueberti. We conclude that A. coqueberti is the obligate predator specialized to Dysdercus species.

N2  - In Java, Drosophila elegans was collected from low to high altitudes, while D. gunungcola was not collected from low altitudes. Periodical observations at Cibodas (west Java : 1300 m in altitude) revealed that the number of both species decreased during the dry season. Both species used Ipomoea flowers for breeding, and D. gunungcola at least bred on Brugmansia flowers. In laboratory experiments, D. gunungcola did not grow to the adult stage at 28℃. The preimaginal period was shorter in D. elegans than in D. gunungcola at 23℃, but did not significantly differ between them at 20 and 18℃. Egg size did not differ between these two species. However, at 18-23℃, D. gunungcola was heavier than D. elegans at 0- and 14-days post eclosion to adult, suggesting that D. gunungcola larvae grew more efficiently than D. elegans larvae at least at 18 and 20℃. Egg production was higher in D. elegans than in D. gunungcola at 20 and 23℃, but nearly equal between them at 18℃. Desiccation tolerance was higher in D. gunungcola. Starvation tolerance was higher in D. gunungcola females than in D. elegans females at 20 and 23℃, but in D. elegans females at 18℃. Males of these two species did not significantly differ in starvation tolerance. Thus, D. elegans has an advantage at high temperatures, while D. gunungcola seems to have advantage, or at least equally well adapted, as D. elegans under cool climates.

N2  - Clutch size in a gregarious leaf-mining moth, Paraleucoptera sinuella, was examined in relation to leaf size and multiple oviposition. The field census of clutch distribution on a host plant, Salix miyabeana, showed that multiple oviposition occurred frequently, and clutches were distributed aggregatively among leaves. Large leaves were apt to receive multiple clutches. Clutch size was correlated positively with leaf size, but negatively with number of clutches per leaf. This implies that females recognize both leaf size and the presence of conspecific eggs and adjust clutch size accordingly. However, the two variables explained only a small amount of variation in clutch size. Thus, additional mechanisms are needed to explain the large amount of variation in clutch size of the leaf miner.

The keys cover all 7 subfamilies and 46 out of 56 genera distributed in Japan. Characters of mandibles, antennal sockets, flagellum, pedicel, occipital carina, notauli, scuto-scutellar suture, metapleural gland orifices, propodeal spiracles, abdominal segments II, III, and IV, and hind tibial spurs are useful to separate among the genera. Hair condition on vertex may be useful to distinguish between Pyramica and Strumigenys.

Except for the larva and pupa of B. tenebrosus, this is the first description of the immature stages of these species. On the basis of careful examination of the head structure, the following characters are suggested to be useful for distinguishing Bibio species : the shape of the cranium, the arrangement of the six sensory pits on the frontal apotome, and the structure of the epipharynx, prementum, and dorsal surface of the stipes. Brief ecological information is also given for each species, and notable morphology of the bibionid larvae and diagnostic characters of the immature stages of Bibio are discussed.

N2  - The result of a cladistic analysis of the Australian Glyphodes Guenee and its allied genera based on adult morphology is presented. The maximum parsimony analysis resulted in 12 most parsimonious trees (length=123, Ci=0.73, and Ri=0.89). The genus Glyphodes falls into three monophyletic groups (Glyphodes group 1, 2 and 3) ; each of these can be diagnosed by adult morphology. Glyphodes as currently recognized cannot be diagnosed as a single monophyletic unit and Dysallacta is not monophyletic but subordinate within Glyphodes group 1. The analysis showed that Agrioglypta and Talanga together form a monophyletic group, with Agrioglypta being a paraphyletic in term of Talanga.

N2  - Larvae of Rhopobota naevana (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae) make leaf shelters by rolling leaves of the Japanese lilac, Syringa reticulata (Oleaceae). Compared with fully expanded leaves, rolled leaves showed a 21% reduction in toughness, a 55% reduction in total phenolic content and a 20% increase in nitrogen content. A bioassay using free-living larvae of Samia ricini (Lepidoptera : Saturniidae) was performed. Samia ricini larvae that were reared on rolled leaves grew up faster than those reared on expanded leaves. These results clearly show that rolled leaves are superior food for lepidopteran larvae and suggest that leaf rolling made by lepidopteran species would induce beneficial changes in other lepidopteran species.

N2  - Alert response of Lasius fuliginosus workers was triggered by both the bodies of foreign workers and a glass dummy treated with foreign cuticular hydrocarbons. Similarities of various cuticular hydrocarbon profiles were evaluated for Nei's distance. The evaluations indicated that the profiles were shared by colony members and maintained even after a month of separation, and that they apparently differed between colonies. Thus, the profiles are specific to colonies. Among the body parts of individual workers, the head, antennae and abdomens shared almost identical profiles. These are parts where the workers touch frequently to check suspect intruders with their antennae. The thorax showed slightly different profiles. Thus, we consider that cuticular hydrocarbon profiles are potentially critical cues for the nestmate recognition in L. fuliginosus.

N2  - Field observations showed that when damaged by herbivores, developing leaves and shoot stems of Quercus mongolica secreted nectar from the wounds. Workers of the ants Lasius japonicus, L. fuliginosus, Formica japonica and F. yessensis visited Q. mongolica trees to collect nectar from herbivore damage during leaf development. This study examined whether nectar secretion from wounds is effective in deterring herbivory by attracting ants, predators to herbivores, to the wounds. On each of 58 young oak trees ant-access and ant-exclusion branches were prepared, and the area of leaves consumed by lepidopteran larvae was compared between these branches. Paired t-test indicated that ant visitation had no significant effect on preventing herbivory ; rather, ants themselves damaged unfolding buds to absorb sugar in phloem sap. On young trees of Q. mongolica close to a nest of L. fuliginosus, a group of workers destroyed some buds completely by nibbling them before bud burst. Lasius japonicus workers were observed nibbling the midribs of developing leaves, resulting in partial withering of the leaves. These results suggest that ant visitation could be costly to Q. mongolica when the density of ants is high.

N2  - Phoretic association between the egg parasitoid Protelenomus sp. and the coreid bug Anoplocnemis phasiana was studied on Ishigaki-jima Island, Japan. The egg parasitoids were associated only with adult bugs. The parasitoids were found on 28.7% of female bugs and on 20.0% of male bugs, and there was no significant difference in the frequency between female and male bugs. The mean and maximum numbers of parasitoids on a bug were 1.2 and 24 for female bugs, and 0.6 and 14 for male bugs, respectively. The number of parasitoids attached to a bug sometimes exceeded the number of eggs in a batch of host bugs. The parasitoids exhibited clumped distribution among the bugs. Most parasitoids were found on the hind femora in male bugs, while about half of parasitoids were attached to the antennae in female bugs. The transfer of parasitoids from a male bug to a female bug was observed to occur while the bugs were copulating. Therefore, phoresy on male bugs is not always disadvantageous for the egg parasitoid. Since the bugs change their host plant seasonally, phoresy on male bugs can be advantageous if the bugs are used as vehicles for transportation to distant places according to the host plant changes of the host bugs.

N2  - This study examined the effect of N-formylloline (NFL) from the seed of endophyte-infected tall fescue on the survival of the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Linnaeus). No reduction in beetle survival was detected when adult beetles were fed on bran containing 500 ppm NFL whereas survival was significantly reduced for adults fed on bran containing 1500 ppm of this alkaloid. Nearly 80% of adult O. surinamensis died after feeding for six days on bran containing 1500 ppm NFL, and yet little further deaths that could be attributed solely to NFL occurred over the next 25 days. All O. surinamensis adults died within 11 days when maintained on bran containing NFL at concentrations of 2500, 5000, and 10000 ppm. The death of all O. surinamensis adults fed on bran containing 10000 ppm of NFL within 6 days indicates that this alkaloid is acting as a toxin. These findings indicate that NFL is responsible, or at least partially responsible, for the adverse effects on the survival of this insect when fed on seeds of endophyte-infected tall fescue.

N2  - We recently showed that reflectance spectra are useful characters for describing geographic variation of elytral color in two sympatric dung beetles (Geotrupes auratus and G. laevistriatus), and within sampling locations we found similar coloration of G. auratus and G. laevistriatus. We now present a further study that examined the sympatric convergence of coloration in the two dung beetle species. The results partially support our previous findings : the peak wavelength of spectral curves of G. laevistriatus shifted in the same direction as that of G. auratus. We also found another condition in one of the study areas : elytra of G. laevistriatus from Ise were found in two colorations (indigo and red), and the color of G. auratus at Ise was similar to the Ise indigo G. laevistriatus. Based on our findings, we suggest that sympatric convergence of elytral coloration of the two Geotrupes dung beetles is incomplete.

N2  - A new species of the genus Thamnobius Schoenherr, T. orientalis sp. nov., is described from the Ryukyus and Taiwan. This is the first representative of this African genus from the Oriental region. Nothing is known of its biology except for the collecting data that some specimens were collected by a malaise trap on Amami-Oshima I., the Ryukyus and a specimen was captured from a tree canopy in the mountainous area of Taiwan. The systematic position and distribution of Thamnobius are discussed.

N2  - A lycaenine species, Heliophorus kohimensis (Tytler) hitherto known from India to Vietnam is revised based mainly on the morphology of male and female genitalia and wing markings. The species is classified into two subspecies, H. k. kohimensis from Naga Hills, India and H. k. elioti subsp. nov. newly discovered in Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and adjacent areas of Yunnan. Both inhabit rather high altitudes. Heliophorus delacouri Eliot stat. nov. originally described as a subspecies of H. kohimensis is known from lowlands in Vietnam and Guangdon, China. Heliophorus delacouri is separated from H. kohimensis based on extensive differences in genital morphology and wing markings and in altitudes of habitats besides their approximated distributions. Hitherto unknown larval hostplant of H. delacouri is recorded as Persicaria chinensis (Polygonaceae).

N2  - Overwintering ground beetles were collected by the quadrat sampling method from the forest floor in a warm-temperate forest of Mt. Nukatayama, Osaka Prefecture, central Japan. In total, we collected 213 carabid beetles representing 11 species, the majority of which were spring-breeders. Their distribution was analyzed in relation to several environmental factors. Most dominant carabid species overwintered preferentially in the exposed ground at forest edges with steep inclination, little vegetation cover and little litter layer. Since the soil-digging sampling method is the traditional method for collecting carabids and specifically from such exposed ground, this was deemed to be an efficient method for our purposes. Facing direction did not affect the hibernating distribution of the beetles.

N2  - The impact of the ant Lasius niger attending the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, on the number of emerging adults of this aphid's primary parasitoid, Lysiphlebus japonicus, and its hyperparasitoids in the presence of predators was assessed experimentally at a no-pesticide mandarin grove. Aphid colonies were artificially initiated on young citrus shoots in spring. Attending ants drove away large predators, such as the coccinellid Harmonia axyridis, from aphid colonies through aggressive behavior, so that the aphid numbers were consistently greater in ant-attended colonies than in colonies where ants were excluded using tanglefoot. L. japonicus females were observed foraging more frequently in ant-attended colonies. They were often attacked by ants, but oviposited successfully by avoiding encounters with approaching ants. In ant-excluded colonies, L. japonicus parasitized a small number of aphids, with most of them being subject to intraguild predation. Ants disregarded parasitized aphids, thereby incidentally protecting them against large predators. Consequently, L. japonicus-mummies were abundant in ant-attended colonies, but scarce in ant-excluded ones. In addition, significantly more adults of both L. japonicus and hyperparasitoids emerged in ant-attended colonies. The larvae of a small coccinellid, Scymnus posticalis, foraged in ant-attended colonies, but were ignored by ants. The number of mummies in ant-attended colonies was reduced when S. posticalis larvae were abundant, but the difference was insignificant. Ant-exclusion after mummy formation revealed that ants reduced intraguild predation and hyperparasitism on immature L. japonicus within mummies. Thus, L. niger attending A. gossypii increases the number of emerging adults of this aphid's primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoids by repelling large predators, although ants do disturb ovipositing parasitoids.

N2  - The big-headed fly, Eudorylas sp. (Diptera: Pipunculidae), is an endoparasite of the leafhopper, Bothrogonia ferruginea (Homoptera: Cicadellidae). Both parasite and host have univoltine life-cycles. The leafhoppers eclose to adults in summer and so overwinter. In spring, they mate and oviposit. The flies overwinter inside their hosts at the endoparasitic larval stage. In spring, fully-grown larvae emerge from the hosts and pupate. Adult flies probably lay eggs inside the larvae of hosts. Parasitized larvae grow to be smaller adults, particularly in forewing size, than unparasitized ones. All hosts die soon after emergence of the endoparasitic larva. The non-lethal effects of endoparasitism, however, differ between male and female hosts. Infected females are always sterile due to undeveloped ovaries, but the males produce sperm normally and seem to mate. Such asymmetric effects of parasitism on females should promote greater ability to resist parasitization in females than in males. However, the severity of parasitism did not differ between the sexes.

N2  - We investigated the egg placement of the microtype tachinid fly Sturmia bella on leaves of the evergreen milkvine Marsdenia tomentosa, one of the foodplants of the host butterfly Parantica sita, in the southern Kinki district of Japan. Most S. bella eggs were found on the undersurface of young M. tomentosa leaves around leaf tips or along leaf margins. Choice of oviposition sites was independent of leaf size and existence of leaf damage made by the host larvae. Parantica sita changed its feeding patterns with larval development and left three types of characteristic feeding marks on M. tomentosa leaves. Since fourth and fifth instar larval P. sita ate the marginal areas, apical areas and sometimes even entire leaves, most S. bella eggs are considered to be ingested during these stages. Both female adults and larvae of P. sita showed no age preference for the M. tomentosa leaves. The relationship between the feeding habit of P. sita and the egg placement of S. bella on M. tomentosa is discussed.

N2  - Using a solitary parasitoid, Haplogonatopus atratus, and 3rd instar larvae of its host, we assessed the fitness payoff from self and conspecific superparasitism. Payoff for the first and second comers, i.e., offspring from the first and second ovipositions, respectively, was measured in terms of survival to wasp emergence, adult size, and developmental time. In most cases, the developmental time and adult size for both the first and second comers were similar to those for single parasitism. Offspring resulting from self and conspecific superparasitism had similar survival rates. The sum of survival rates of the first and second comers was slightly higher than the survival rate for single parasitism when the time interval between the first and second ovipositions was 1h. This suggests an advantage of self superparasitism over single parasitism, but the sum decreased with increasing oviposition intervals. The survival rate of the second comer in conspecific superparasitism was less than 15% below the survival rate for single parasitism (64.4%) for oviposition intervals of 48h or shorter, but the survival rate decreased with increasing oviposition intervals longer than 48h. This indicates that conspecific superparasitism is adaptive conditionally. Furthermore, the following two observations suggests that the superparasitizing female kills the first comer before laying an egg: (1) first comers were more likely to survive when the superparasitizing wasp did not completely inspect the host with her stinger; and (2) first comers died more frequently before the 3rd instar than in singly parasitized hosts.

These two species are syntopic, have similar life histories, and feed on the same host plant (Viburnum erosum Thunberg) in Kyoto, Japan. Pyrrhalta esakii lays small single egg masses on branch tips. The larvae are solitary and feed on buds or leaves. Pyrrhalta humeralis, on the other hand, lays large egg masses at the base of branches, often in groups. The hatched larvae move toward the buds on the tips of the branches, and often feed on the same leaves. Differences in the larval traits of P. esakii and P. humeralis are discussed in terms of the interactions with their host plants.

N2  - Queens of a social parasite ant Lasius fuliginosus exhibited sequential characteristic behaviors before intruding into the nests of the host species L. japonicus. After landing on the ground, queens prowled about and crept towards L. japonicus workers that were isolated from their nestmates. Queens attacked and quickly killed the workers with their mandibles, and then resumed prowling while holding the dead bodies at the joints between head and thorax, or occasionally at those between the thorax and abdomen. Alate queens sometimes stopped behind grasses or small stones, where they shed their wings using their hind- and mid-legs. The dealate queens then began prowling again, and approached the nest entrances of L. japonicus while keeping the heads of the workers bodies directed forwards. They often succeeded in entering nests without provoking any hostility from the L. japonicus workers at the entrance. Although they were occasionally blocked and viciously attacked by workers, displaying the host-workers bodies to nestmates allowed the dealate queens to penetrate the host nests.

N2  - We investigated the life history traits of Galerucella nipponensis to clarify the relationship between the population dynamics of this leaf beetle and the phenology of its aquatic host plant, Trapa japonica. The developmental zero and the sum of effective temperature were estimated as 11.3℃ and 68.7 heat-day degrees (HDD) for eggs, 10.3℃ and 55.3HDD for 1st instars, 11.3℃ and 36.6HDD for 2nd instars, 10.3℃ and 70.9HDD for 3rd instars, 9.9℃ and 55.3HDD for pupae, and 10.1℃ and 122.3HDD for female adults from eclosion to oviposition. The dry weight of leaves consumed throughout larval and adult stages increased with the generation within 4 or 5 generations a year. Females that were reared throughout their life span under a short daylength (12L: 12D) and at 25℃ entered reproductive diapause. The pupa and young adults were most sensitive to photoperiod. Females reared under a long daylength (16L: 8D) from egg to the 33-day adult stage laid eggs continuously even though they were transferred to the short daylength.

N2  - The weevil Curculio albovittatus (Kono) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was found to complete its larval stage feeding on a single bean gall produced by Pontania sp. (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) on leaves of Salix sachalinensis Fr. Shmidt in Haga Onsen, Haga Cho, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan. There was one weevil larva per gall in 32% of the galls sampled. The adult weevil laid an egg on the gall of the Pontania sp. and the hatched larva entered the gall. The inside of the gall wall was heavily grazed by the weevil larva. No sawfly larvae, either dead or alive, were found in the galls parasitized by the weevil. The matured weevil larvae left the galls and pupated in the soil. This unique life history suggests that the C. albovittatus larva is an obligate cecidophage.

On the Honshu side of the Kanmon Strait where Shimonoseki is located, R. kanmonensis has a wider distributional range than has been thought; colonies were found not only in areas along the coast, but also in inland areas including forests with natural vegetation. In Kyushu the termite was found only in and around the Kiku Peninsula. The distributional patterns of R. kanmonensis and related species and the historical background of the distributional area strongly suggest the artificial introduction of this species into Shimonoseki.

N2  - The life-history of the willow spittlebug Aphrophora pectoralis on two willow species, Salix miyabeana and S. sachalinensis, was studied in Hokkaido, northern Japan. A. pectoralis has a univoltine life-cycle overwintering in the egg stage. There were no significant differences in the duration of nymphal stages between the two willow species. Mating and oviposition occurred from early August to mid-October, and at the start of this period adult females had about 10 mature oocytes. Thereafter, the number of mature oocytes increased, peaking in late September. The cumulative number of egg masses per shoot on S. sachalinensis was significantly greater than that on S. miyabeana. This result suggests that female spittlebugs prefer S. sachalinensis to S. miyabeana as an oviposition plant despite no difference in the growth performance between the two host species.

N2  - The effect of low temperatures on male pupae (pharate adults) and adults of Glossina pallidipes was assessed in relation to their use in sterile insect technique (SIT) programmes for the eradication of populations of this important disease vector in Africa. Since only male insects require to be released for the SIT, sex separation at some stage of development can be advantageous. For tsetse, sex separation exploiting the temporal difference in emergence pattern of females and males has enabled the direct stocking of fly production cages for G. austeni and G. pallidipes, leaving male pupae available for further handling. With some species of tsetse, e.g. G. pallidipes, it is important that males attain sexual maturity before they are released and therefore a planned and synchronised emergence of males would be beneficial. A protocol for controlled emergence based on low temperature treatment of mature male pupae is under development. Male pupae were incubated at 15℃, 18℃ or 20℃ for 24, 48 or 72 hours and thereafter allowed to emerge at either 23-24℃ or 26.5℃. In order to simulate the proposed use of the chilled adult release system for areawide tsetse SIT, adult males were stored at 7℃ for 18, 24, 48 and 72 hours followed by 6 hours at 4℃. Emergence rate, survival without blood and insemination capacity were not significantly affected by low temperature storage of pupae. Chilling of adults resulted in lower insemination capacity and 10-32% mortality one day after removal from low temperature. Low temperature treatment of pupae delayed eclosion of G. pallidipes by 2-3 days. The potential uses of these procedures in an operational SIT programme are discussed.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were carried out to study the effects of six constant temperatures, ranging from 15 to 27.5℃, on the rate of development and emergence of Trissolcus mitsukurii, T. plautiae and T. itoi using Halyomorpha halys eggs as hosts. At 15℃, both male and female progenies completed their development to adulthood, but a few females were able to emerge from the host eggs. Both sexes developed and successfully emerged from host eggs at 17.5℃ and above. Males of all parasitoids developed faster than females at each temperature. The value of the effective cumulative temperature shows that these three parasitoids may produce 11-15 generations annually. As H. halys produce 1-2 generations annually in Japan, the results indicated that these parasitoids do not depend solely on H. halys eggs for their hosts.

N2  - Distribution of tiglic acid as a male pheromone in the hair-pencil complex and micro-structures of the constitutive hair scales were investigated in the yellow peach moth, Conogethes punctiferalis. Hair-pencils were found in a pair of cuticular pockets located bilaterally at the base of the genitalia, and consisted of phylliform (PHS), supatulate (SHS), filiform (FHS) and retiform hair scales (RHS). Elimination of hair-pencils significantly reduced mating success in C. punctiferalis. Selective GC analysis of extracts of the four types of hair scales revealed that fluff hair scales (FHS+RHS) exclusively contained tiglic acid. Scanning electron microscopy showed that RHS have characteristic structures for release of pheromonal scent or "osmophores". It was confirmed that males of C. punctiferalis discharged their osmophores when they responded to the female sex pheromone. Tiglic acid as well as other scent chemicals was not detected from the hair-pencils of its sibling species, Conogethes sp. by gas chromatogram-electroantennogram recordings, although they have the same types of hair scales. Tiglic acid was concluded to be involved in inter- and intra-specific male recognition in the final steps of courtship behavior of these two species.

N2  - To examine the species integrity of a water strider, Gerris gracilicornis, multivariate analyses based on 32 morphometric characters were performed on 158 male adults collected from 47 populations in the Russian Far East, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, as well as on 66 individuals of three other Gerris (Macrogerris) species (G. yezoensis, G. insularis, and Gerris sp.). In canonical discriminant analyses, all of these species were distinguished unambiguously. When multivariate analyses were applied to G. gracilicornis individuals, both principal component and canonical discriminant analyses indicated that there are three morphologically and geographically separated population groups (Groups A, B, and C). Group A is distributed in the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Islands from Hokkaido Island to Yaku-shima Island, Group B in the Ryukyu Islands from Amami-oshima Island to Yonaguni-jima Island, and Group C in the Russian Far East, Cheju Island of Korea, and Taiwan. Canonical discriminant analysis of laboratory-grown insects suggested that the morphometric differences among these groups were not due to environmental or climatic differences, but to genetic differences among the different groups.

N2  - Five species of ocean skaters Halobates are the only insects that have successfully colonized the ocean. In the western Pacific Ocean, three species of Halobates, H. micans, H. sericeus and H. germanus, are known to occur over a wide area. We investigated the spatio-temporal features of Halobates during the three cruises of R/V Hakuho Maru in the western Pacific in 1994, 1995 and 1998. During these cruises, the area between latitudes 7°N-22°N and longitudes 125°E-150°E was surveyed in all cruises, and in this area H. germanus was absent while H. micans and H. sericeus were caught every year. In 1994 and 1995, H. micans was found almost to the exclusion of H. sericeus and in 1998 H. sericeus was found almost to the exclusion of H. micans, suggesting that these two species rarely co-occur, while their distribution ranges change temporally. We examined water surface temperature, prevailing winds and the El Nino event as possible factors responsible for the replacement of H. micans by H. sericeus in 1998. On the ocean surface, oceanic diffusion is constantly acting to disperse Halobates in all directions. However, local distribution patterns of H. micans and H. sericeus were highly clumped, suggesting that these species have the ability to aggregate against oceanic diffusion.

N2  - Melanic individuals were found in a laboratory colony of the adzuki bean borer Ostrinia scapulalis (Walker) collected in Japan. The melanism was expressed in adults and pupae of both sexes but not in larvae. A series of crossing experiments indicated that the melanism in O. scapulalis follows Mendelian inheritance as an autosomal recessive trait. The present results suggest a common regulatory mechanism for melanin deposition in the pupal and imaginal development of O. scapulalis.

N2  - Overwintered eggs of the gall-forming aphid Paracolopha morrisoni hatch early in spring synchronously with the budburst of the primary host plant Zelkova serrata. During embryogenesis the eggs are exposed to increasing mean temperature with diel fluctuations. This study examined the effects of temperatures and the odor of expanding host buds on egg hatching. Overwintered eggs were incubated in darkness at constant (14, 17, 20 and 24℃), increasing (from 14℃ to 24℃) and alternating (19 : 7℃ and 20 : 14℃) temperatures. Hatchability at the constant temperatures was low, ranging from 15% to 34%, with the maximum at 20℃. At this temperature, however, 98% of the eggs advanced embryogenesis until eyes became discernible. A stepwise temperature increase without diel fluctuations had no positive effect on hatchability. Incubation under the alternating temperature regimes increased hatchability to 78% and reduced the heat sum required for hatching. When eggs were incubated with and without cut unfolding buds of Z. serrata under the alternating 19 : 7℃ regime, the presence of host buds had no effect on the hatchability and hatching time of the eggs. These results indicate that embryogenesis can proceed under various temperature conditions without being influenced by host chemicals but that daily cycles of temperature are prerequisite for hatching.

N2  - Multiple-cavity galls of a cerataphidine species were found on the evergreen Styrax benzoides in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. Comparison of mitochondrial DNA sequences between aphids from the galls and aphids of Pseudoregma carolinensis from bamboo revealed that the gall-forming aphids are of P. carolinensis. The colony sizes of mature galls were comparatively small, up to approximately 1, 500 individuals. The galls contained many pseudoscorpion-like 2nd-instar soldiers, which attacked an experimentally introduced moth larva, and which were observed to push globules of honeydew out of the subgall. The life cycle (holocycle) is probably annual, with some aphids remaining on bamboo throughout the year. The gall and alate morph are described.

N2  - The imidazole derivative KK-42 reduced, in a dose dependent manner, ecdysteroid production by the prothoracic glands explanted from the penultimate instar larvae of Schistocerca gregaria. Virtually no ecdysteroids were produced with 12.5μg KK-42 per ml medium. Injections of 20-200μg KK-42 into adult females, however, did not reduce the deposition of ecdysteroids into the eggs nor the life span and fertility of the recipients. Topical application of 40μg KK-42 to the eggs at different stages of embryogenesis reduced the number of viable 1^<st> instar larvae to 0-10%. The treatment of young eggs occasionally caused death in an early stage of embryogenesis but most embryos developed into the 1^<st> instar larvae and perished before, during, or shortly after hatching. A dose of 4μg/eggs caused similar effects but at lower frequency, except after the application on day 7 (hatching occurs on day 14) when only 4% of the insects survived. In spite of this drastic effect, the only change in the content of ecdysteroids was about 1-day delay of the decline that normally occurs between days 10 and 11 of embryonic development.

N2  - We examined the salinity tolerance of a small aquatic beetle species, Hygrotus impressopunctatus (Dytiscidae), collected from the Kuril Islands. All beetles in seawater died by the 13th day, and 21 out of 54 beetles were still alive in freshwater on the 13th day. One beetle survived in seawater for at least 12 days. Over 50% of the beetles survived the first four days in seawater, and their survival was almost the same as those in freshwater. The mean survival time of the beetles in seawater was 6.2 days. This study suggests that H. impressopunctatus could disperse via seawater, although their survival was significantly better in freshwater.

N2  - Microsatellite loci were described for the parthenogenetic ant Pristomyrmex pungens. Two of four loci showed polymorphism, and the allelism of each locus was confirmed. Relatedness among colony members was extremely high (0.944), but one of the colonies contained two different genotypes. These results demonstrated that some colonies are comprised of multiple genetic lines, contrary to the existing assumption that parthenogenetic reproduction indicates monoclonality.

N2  - Burying beetles bury and treat carcasses with secretions to provide them for their offspring as food. I tested whether Nicrophorus quadripunctatus reduces the growth of mold, a potential competitor, by burial and treatment of carcasses, based on simple field experiments using mold-infested raw chicken meat. Mold colonies developed on most of the chicken meat pieces placed on ground without burying beetles. Mold also developed on artificially buried meat pieces. However, the development of mold was limited on meat pieces treated by burying beetles, whether the pieces were buried or not. These results clearly indicate that the carrion treatment, rather than the burial itself, effectively prevents mold growth on carcasses.

N2  - Oiketicinine species, Acanthopsyche (Eumetisa) taiwana Sonan, 1935, is first recorded from the Ryukyus, Japan. Eumetisa is synonymized with the genus Manatha Moore, 1877. Therefore scientific name of this species is changed to Manatha taiwana (Sonan, 1935), comb. nov. The generic characters of Manatha is revised. Morphology and some behaviours of the larvae, pupae and adults of both sexes are given in comparison with other oiketicinine species. The male last instar larva is unique to hang the swollen exuviae of the penultimate instar at the posterior opening of the pupation case.

N2  - The superfamily Psylloidea of the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands is revised except for the family Triozidae. Six species belonging to 4 genera of 3 families were found on the islands. Four new endemic species, Paurocephala albescens, Cacopsylla boninofatsiae, C. insularis, and C. maculipennis are described based on adults and 5th instars. The existence of endemic species is recognized on the islands for the first time. Two known species, Heteropsylla cubana and Mesohomotoma camphorae, are redescribed. Keys to the families, genera and species, as well as illustrations of the characteristics of all species are provided. To date, only psylloid species widespread in the Oriental region and the Pacific have been identified on the islands. The present study reveals that the psylloid fauna of the islands is partly affected by that of Japan proper and the Ryukyus, which are represented by some of the newly found endemic species.

Although the apterae of E. heterotrichum are characterized by having thick and stubby setae on the head, thorax, abdomen and siphunculi, the setae of the Japanese apterae were found to exhibit geographical and seasonal variation in shape and length. The fundatrix, oviparous female and male are described here for the first time. In the Kanto District, central Japan, its life cycle was found to be holocyclic, and the sexuales appeared from October onward.

N2  - To examine the possibility that mating continues in the winter in Okinawa, we observed the effects of adult temperature on male mating success in Euscepes postfasciatus. Males kept at 15℃ for the first 30 or 60 days of adulthood had much lower mating rates than those kept at 25℃ when paired with females at 25℃. However, when males were first kept at 25℃ for 30 days and then exposed to 15℃ for the next 30 days, they showed a high mating rate even when paired with females at 15℃, although the rate rapidly decreased with time. This indicates that 1) mating activity itself was not inhibited at 15℃ and that 2) sexually mature males retained the inseminating ability even after a period of cool conditions. The possibility that sperm is quickly depleted after several matings at a spermiogenesis-suppressing temperature was pointed out to explain the present results. This and other laboratory studies suggest the occurrence of mating in the winter highly likely on Okinawa Island, and point out the importance of release of sterile insects in all seasons including winter in eradicating this pest.

N2  - Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC's) of Anoplophora malasiaca consisted of saturated, monoenyl, dienyl, and trienyl compounds ranging from C22 to C37, but the constituents differed between males and females. Male hydrocarbons were saturated, monoenyl and dienylcompounds from C22 to C30, which accounted for 75.8, 24.0, and 0.2% of total amount, respectively. By contrast, female hydrocarbons contained saturated, monoenyl, dienyl, and trienyl compounds from C22 to C37, which accounted for 80.0, 18.3, 0.6, and 1.1% of the total amount, respectively. Approximately 50% of males showed abdominal bending (AB) behavior towards a glass dummy when female CHC's were applied to it with as yet unidentified active components present in ether eluent from silica gel chromatography of female elytra extract. These male responses were almost at the same level as those to the crude extract of female elytra (53.3%). However, the AB behavior was evoked from 37% of the males when male CHC's were presented along with the female unidentified active components. Few males showed the behavior in response to the ether fraction of male elytra extract even when combined with either female or male CHC's, or to either CHC's or the ether fraction. It was reconfirmed that the unidentified active compounds in the female elytra were a key factor of contact sex pheromone activity. By contrast, CHC's appeared to be non-essential but important for sexual recognition in the mating sequence of A. malasiaca.

N2  - Closely related species that have similar ecological requirements often vary slightly in their preferences for abiotic environments. In poikilothermal animals, closely related species often utilize different thermal habitats. The congeneric satyrine butterflies Lethe sicelis and L. diana coexist in similar environments and feed on similar foods ; however, L. diana tends to inhabit higher altitudes than L. sicelis. This study investigated the microhabitats of the two Lethe butterflies for three years to know whether these butterflies are segregated according to light intensity. When resting or flying, L. sicelis occupied sites that received slightly more sunlight than L. diana did, as predicted ; however, the territorial sites of L. sicelis were darker than those of L. diana. L. sicelis had higher thoracic temperatures than L. diana when air temperatures were low. These results suggest that L. sicelis selects better-lit sites in order to use solar radiation to maintain the higher thoracic temperature in flight.

N2  - The pleasing fungus beetles, Dacne japonica and D. picta, are pests of the shiitake mushroom, Lentinus edodes. Males of both species stridulate by scraping the files on the vertex against the ridges of the pronotum. When a male contacts another individual, he first touches the other's elytra by the maxillary palpi. If the contacted individual was a male, the palpating male ignored him and moved away or sometimes produced aggressive chirps. If the contacted individual was a female, he started another gentler chirping and tried to mount her. He kept singing this courtship chirping during copulation. The male produced the aggressive chirps also when another individual, male or female, interfered with his mating or feeding. The numbers of chirps in a bout and the numbers of syllables in a chirp were significantly different between aggressive and courtship behaviors for both species. The numbers and intervals of syllables in the courtship chirps were significantly different between the two species, whereas there were no differences in the aggressive chirps.

N2  - The flight ability of five populations of the dung beetle, Geotrupes laevistriatus, was examined. Beetles collected in Sapporo, Hokkaido, did not fly, whereas indirect evidence suggested that those collected in Yokohama, Honshu, flew under an experimental condition. There was no significant difference in wing size between Hokkaido and Honshu individuals. The beetles collected in Sapporo and Akkeshi, Hokkaido had no developed flight muscle, whereas all individuals collected in Honshu, Yokohama (Kanagawa), Shizuoka (Shizuoka), and Ritto (Shiga), had well developed flight muscle. Brief discussion is given on the adaptive significance of the observed flight muscle dimorphism of G. laevistriatus.

N2  - This study examined whether differences in bud size affected the oviposition behavior of the chestnut gall wasp, Dryocosmus kuriphilus. The frequency of multiple oviposition by the same or other conspecific adults on a single bud was examined. The mean dry weight was significantly larger in buds with eggs laid than in ones with no eggs, in buds with one or more oviposition scars than in ones with no scars, and in buds with multiple oviposition scars than in ones with a single oviposition scar. Thus, D. kuriphilus adults preferred large buds for oviposition. The proportion of buds with multiple oviposition scars increased significantly with an increasing proportion of buds with eggs laid. The regression coefficient of the mean number of eggs laid per bud on the number of oviposition scars was significantly larger than 1.0. These results suggest that D. kuriphilus adults laid eggs repeatedly in a larger bud under high densities. The ovipositional site selection for larger buds in D. kuriphilus may be adaptive when migration from one ovipositional site to another is risky, and when larval performance decreases due to overcrowding in a bud by multiple oviposition.

N2  - Bionomics of Hexomyza simplicoides was surveyed in Kyoto, central Japan. Adults emerged and oviposited in spring. Knot-like galls containing one larva were formed on the twigs of spring shoots of Salix chaenomeloides (Salicaceae) in autumn. On attacked shoots, shoot length and the number of galls were positively correlated. Long shoots (≧150mm long) of the host plant harbored galls more frequently than short shoots (<150mm), although long shoots were smaller in number. Adult emergence rate in longer shoots was higher than that in shorter shoots. The field census and laboratory experiment indicate that the preference of ovipositing females for longer shoots is correlated with high larval performance.

The scouting was carried out on sunny days or days with at least occasional sun. When scouts located target Formica colonies, they ran back to their home nests along straight courses. While returning, they sometimes stopped and strongly bend their gaster to rub the apical parts with the tips of their legs. Raiding swarms marched toward the target Formica colonies along the same courses that the returning scouts had took. In a raiding swarm, the scout that had located the target colony was not always at the head but in the first 50 workers.

N2  - This study examined morphological differentiation of the brachypterous grasshopper Parapodisma subastris among three neighboring populations, using univariate and multivariate analyses. Functionless fore and hind wings exhibited a larger variability than did other characters. The length of male cerci, a part of genitalia, varied less among populations than did that of female cerci. This low variability in male genitalia may be ascribed to stabilizing selection acting on male genitalia. Factor analysis suggested that genitalia and degenerated wings were distinguished from the other characters in the intensity of correlations. In spite of the vicinity of the populations, discriminant analysis showed that 94%-100% of population members were correctly classified into the populations to which they belonged. This suggests that the opportunities of migration among the populations are limited enough to lead to genetic differentiation.

N2  - Nucleotide sequences of a 0.7kb portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene were analyzed using Japanese species of water striders belonging to the subgenus Macrogerris. Although the sequences were rather homogeneous among individuals within both Gerris gracilicornis and G. yezoensis, considerable variation was observed among insects showing conventionally recognized diagnostic characteristics of G. insularis. Results of molecular phylogenetic analyses clearly indicated that there are three distinct lineages, designated as types A, B, and C, among these latter insects. Comparisons of nucleotide sequences indicated that genetic distances among these lineages were much larger than those between G. gracilicornis and G. yezoensis. From PCR-RFLP analyses of insects collected from 35 localities, it was revealed that the geographic distributions of types B and C were divided between northeastern Honshu island and western Japan including Kyushu island and central to western Honshu island, whereas that of type A largely overlapped with those of the other two types. Although male adults of the three types were homogeneous in conventionally recognized diagnostic characteristics, apparent differences were observed in the shape of the head, pronotum, fore femur, and color pattern of the anterior pronotum between type A and the other two types. In addition, types B and C showed apparent dimorphism in hind wings, containing both long- and short-winged individuals, whereas type A showed only long and wide hind wings. Preliminary observations of mating behavior indicated that a precopulatory reproductive isolation is operative between type A and other two types. Based on these results, evolutionary relationships among the three lineages are discussed.

N2  - Genetic variation of 16S rRNA gene sequences were investigated in two Japanese lucanid beetles, Ceruchus lignarius and Dorcus rectus rectus, which have different habitats and distributional patterns. Present results indicate that the inter-populational sequence variation of 16S rRNA within three subspecies of C. lignarius are much smaller than those between all combinations of different subspecies, suggesting the monophylies of these three subspecies. Our results also suggest that sequence divergence within a single population is very low in this species and that differentiations increase in the order of intra-population (0-0.11%), intra-subspecies (0-2.26%), intra-species (2.80-7.99%) and interspecies (7.34-10.05%). Likewise, intra-subspecific nucleotide replacements of D.r. rectus (0-1.06%) were much smaller than the interspecific divergence (14.82-19.95%).

N2  - Seven species of Cephalcia spruce sawflies sampled in Europe and China differ considerably in some life history traits such as prepupal weight, time of adult emergence, clustering of the eggs and larval gregariousness. Genetic divergence detected by allozyme analysis was substantial, even among siblings or closely related forms. Haploid chromosome numbers range from n=18 to n=35 in Cephalcia, whereas the related sawfly Acantholyda erythrocephala has n=11. Within the C. arvensis complex, geographical and phenological (adult emergence time) forms show chromosome numbers from n=23 to n=29. As a general tendency, low numbered karyotypes are metacentric rich while the high numbered are acrocentric rich. The genetic variation pattern among species show little concordance with the chromosome differences. Some species with low genetic distance have very different karyotypes, whereas other species with similar karyotypes are genetically rather distant. These chromosome differences are likely to be related to natural history traits and population structure affecting the fixation rate of chromosome mutants. In the two largest and gregarious species, C. abietis and C. alashanica, chromosome evolution seems to be directed toward increasing chromosome number but karyological changes seem to be rather rare events. Conversely, in smaller species, C. arvensis complex and the siblings C. alpina and C. annulicornis, with solitary larval behaviour and large variability in phenology, chromosomal changes seem to be fixed much more frequently. In particular, phenological isolation of breeding units with a small effective population size, enhanced by the haplodiploid genetic system, could favour the stochastic fixation of rearrangements, and chromosomally differentiated taxa may arise.

N2  - Wing polymorphism with continuous variation in flight musculature was discovered in a tropical field cricket, Teleogryllus derelictus Gorochov derived from Java, Indonesia. In this species, typical short-winged (SW) and long-winged (LW) morphs often observed in other species of cricket were found, but individuals with intermediate wing lengths (IM morph) were also observed. However, the frequency distribution in relative wing lengths, i.e. hind wing length (HW)/fore wing length (FW), was bimodal with a relatively low frequency of IM morphs. Flight muscle mass at adult emergence was directly related to HW/FW and the variation was continous. It changed little after adult emergence in SW morphs, but showed a>70% increase in some LW morphs whereas a reduction in mass due to histolysis occurred in IM and other LW individuals. Flight muscle growth and histolysis were accompanied by conspicuous color changes apparently related to cytochrome c. The total fat and triacylglycerol contents of the body were closely related to body weight, but not to HW/FW. Some LW adults flew out of the rearing tanks within a week after adult emergence. In response to a synthetic adipokinetic hormone (AKH), both LW and SW adults were capable of forming low-density lipophorin (LDLp), which is known to be important in mobilizing lipid fuel for flight activity in other insects. The methanol extracts of corpora cardiaca taken from both LW and SW morphs showed AKH activity, indicating that inter-morph physiological differentiation has not occurred in the lipid-mobilization system. The present results with T. derelictus do not support Roff's hypothesis that a reduction in flight muscles occurred before that in wing length during the course of evolution for wing dimorphism, but may suggest an alternative evolutionary pathway.

Through a transfer experiment we ascertained that the galls were of the ginger aphid Pseudoregma sundanica. The galls and alates are described. We found that the species produces pseudoscorpion-like, 2nd-instar sterile soldiers in the galls. Soldiers attacked artificially introduced syrphid larvae, and also stung human skin with their stylets. On one gall, soldiers attacked 20 conspecific non-soldiers that had been introduced onto the surface, both from the gall itself and from another gall. This is a second instance of attack by soldiers upon conspecific aphids.

N2  - The effects of carcass size and parental feeding on the survival and growth of larvae of the burying beetle Nicrophorus quadripunctatus were experimentally examined under varying resource conditions. Female adults laid more eggs on large carcasses than on small and medium ones, indicating that they regulate clutch size corresponding to the amount of food available. On small carcasses, the daily survival rates of larvae on the 1st and 2nd days were low, as was the weight of dispersed larvae. These declines may be due to severe competition among larvae for space and parental feeding. Carcasses were largely expended by a clutch of larvae by the 5th day. Also on small carcasses, total parental feeding time per larva was positively correlated with the average weight of dispersed larvae, suggesting that parental feeding influences the growth of larvae when food is limited. On large carcasses, parental feeding time per larva was short on the 2nd day, possibly because parents expended much energy in manipulating the carcasses. This shortened feeding time resulted in a decline in the larval survival rate.

N2  - Mating behavior of the black chafer, Holotrichia loochooana loochooana (Sawada)(Coleoptera : Scarabaeidae), was observed in Miyako Island, southwestern Japan. Females settled on colonies of the beach naupaka, Scaevola sericea Vahal after evening flight. They showed clumped distribution within the colonies. Soon after they settled on the leaves, they commenced feeding on the leaf margin and extruded the abdominal gland (calling behavior). Attracted males landed on or near the calling females, and immediately mounted them. All the females accepted the males upon contact. After the genitalia was successfully jointed, the male raised his legs and suspended by his genitalia. Mean duration of copulation was 60.0±12.1 min (mean±SD, N=27). Of 17 calling females collected in the field, six females laid fertilized eggs. This indicates that females are polyandrous. In the laboratory, females and males stayed in a vermiculite layer in boxes during the day and came to the surface in the evening. Mating activity was observed only in the evening. Females and males continued to feed in the night, and went into the vermiculite layer at dawn.

N2  - Oviposition site preference by a bivoltine attelabid weevil, Cycnotrachelus roelofsi, that feeds on and rolls fresh leaves of Styrax japonicus for oviposition, was studied. Overwintered females preferred medial spring leaves to lateral leaves and selected larger leaves for rolling. The leaf infestation by first generation adults was much more severe than that by the overwintered adults and the first generation females avoided leaves that had been infested by conspecific adults. In addition, fresh summer leaves available for the first generation females were less abundant than fresh spring leaves for overwintered females, because the production of summer leaves reached a peak in April and then fell in May when the first generation females emerge. As a result, first generation females inevitably rolled smaller summer leaves for rolling.

N2  - Field observations showed that the gall-parasitic flea weevil Rhynchaenus hustachei often parasitized the pouch galls of the aphid Paracolopha morrisoni on Zelkova serrata leaves in the Kinki District, Central Japan. The eggs of the weevil were laid into the gall walls and hatched larvae entered the galls. Each parasitized gall contained only one weevil. The inside of the gall wall was heavily grazed by the weevil larva, resulting in destruction of the aphid colony. These observations suggest that the weevil is an obligatory cecidophage. At three of six study sites, weevil parasitism was the greatest mortality factor for the aphids. A facultative hyperparasitoid, Eupelmus urozonus (Eupelmidae) and Pteromalus sp. (Pteromalidae) parasitized the larvae and pupae of the weevil.

N2  - We investigated changes in the abundance of vespid wasps responding to mast fruiting that occurred in 1996 in a lowland tropical rainforest of Peninsular Malaysia, using Malaise traps from 1995 to 1997. The nocturnal vespine wasp (Provespa anomala) and polistine wasps were collected throughout the trapping period, without any distinct changes in abundance. True hornets (Vespa mocsaryana, V. tropica leefmansi, and V. multimaculata pendleburyi), however, were trapped only in several months during or just after the mass falling of fruits. Mast fruiting may temporally increase the population of Vespa hornets that depend on ripe fruits as carbohydrate sources.

N2  - To estimate thermal effects of dark oral secretion applied on nest surface by adult paper wasps, we measured cell temperature of paper model nests. Paper models of Polistes nests, with the following five different solar radiation absorption rates, were made : 10% (absorption of white tissue), 40% (equivalent to the absorption rate at the lower part of natural vertical nest), 70% (upper part), 85% (dorsum) and 95% (absorption rate of pure black poster color). The mean difference between cell and ambient temperatures measured in the field between 1030 and 1300 on a sunny and calm summer day (solar radiation quantity (SRQ)=820.8W/m^2, ambient temperature (T_a)=30.0±0.1℃) was 6.2±0.1℃, 7.1±0.2℃, 7.9±0.2℃, 8.7±0.2℃ and 10.0±0.2℃ for white, 40%, 70%, 85% and black model nests, respectively. The temperature difference was significant for any pair. On a windy day (mean wind velocity=1.0 m/s), such a thermal effect was small in the painted nests, and the mean temperature excess in the daytime (1030-1300, SRQ=690.3 W/m^2, T_a=31.2±0.2℃) was 5.5±0.1℃, 6.8±0.3℃, 7.1±0.3℃, 7.3±0.3℃ and 7.1±0.3℃ for white, 40%, 70%, 85% and black model nests, respectively. The results suggest that the darkening of nest surface significantly increases the cell temperature when nests receive sunlight.

N2  - Host use pattern of three lepidopteran leaf miners was studied on the host plant, Salix miyabeana. Interspecific co-occurrence, on a single leaf was exceptional, and the three leaf miner species used leaves in different size. There was a positive correlation between leaf size and leaf area required for larval development of each species. This host use pattern depending on leaf size is probably due to leaf-flushing pattern of the host plant. Since S. miyabeana produced temporal variation in leaf size throughout the growing season, size of leaves available to the leaf miners varied temporally depending on different ovipositing timing of the leaf miners. Thus, it is concluded that different timing of oviposition results in resource partitioning among the leaf miners.

N2  - The process of wing development and degeneration in the winter moth Nyssiodes lefuarius is described. The adult female of this moth has vestigial wings. However, there was no difference in wing development between the sexes until pupation. Even in the beginning of the pupal stage, females retained well-developed wing discs as large as those of the male. After pupal diapause, the male began to develop complete wings, while the wing discs of females atrophied : the wing epithelium retracted from the pupal cuticle, due to rapid digestion by haemocytes that invaded from the proximal part of the pupal wings. This is considered an apoptotic event, or programmed cell death. Such a process is probably unique to winter moths of the family Geometridae.

N2  - Wolbachia-mediated parthenogenesis was found in the larval-pupal endoparasitoid Gronotoma micromorpha. This species exhibited thelytoky and the females mostly produced female progeny. Male progeny were produced by females treated with tetracycline, suggesting that microorganisms induce thelytoky in G. micromorpha. Diagnostic PCR indicated that this species was infected with Wolbachia, which appear to be a causative agent of thelytoky. Males from an antibiotic-treated mother successfully mated with females. Antibiotic-treated females produced many male progeny, while untreated females produced exclusively female produced many male progeny, while untreated females produced exclusively female progeny with or without mating. There was no significant difference in the sex ratio of the subsequent generation between mated and unmated females. This shows that eggs deposited by mated females were not fertilized.

N2  - Antlions living in seaside dunes lay their eggs at night during mid-summer below the sand-surface, where the temperature becomes extremely high in the daytime. We first observed the oviposition behavior and examined the number of eggs laid per night by Myrmeleon bore and Distoleon contubernalis. The larva of the former species is a pit builder but the latter is not. Most female antlions of both species came to the oviposition site from 8 : 00p.m. to 9 : 00p.m. They oviposited eggs one by one at the depth of ca. 7.5mm (M. bore) or 10mm (D. contubernalis) in the sand. The average number of eggs laid per night per female was 16.5 for M. bore and 17.3 for D. contubernalis. Secondly, we examined their hatching rates under the conditions of constant or changing temperature in order to know how their eggs are tolerant to high temperature. Under a constant temperature of 37.5℃, most eggs of D. contubernalis hatched successfully, while no eggs of M. bore hatched. At the temperature of 40℃ none of the eggs of either species hatched. Under quasi-natural conditions, the hatching rate became lower as the total duration of exposure to a temperature above 40℃ became longer. These results suggest that the female antlion selects a thermally suitable oviposition site by using an environmental indicator.

N2  - The parasitoid community associated with the monophagous leafroller Eudemis gyrotis (Meyrick)(Tortricidae) on a bayberry, Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc. (Myricaceae) was studied in a natural population at Mt. Tanakami, Shiga, central Japan, in 1998 and 1999. The parasitoid community structure of E. gyrotis was described in order to elucidate the effect of the ecological features of parasitoids on the community organization. The seasonal changes in the number of E. gyrotis larvae plus pupae showed a similar pattern between 1998 and 1999. Thirteen species of parasitoids were recorded as primary parasitoids of E. gyrotis, and ten as secondary parasitoids. Apanteles sp. (ater-group)(Braconidae) and Goniozus japonicus Ashmead (Bethylidae) were dominant larval parasitoids. Apanteles sp., which is a koinobiont endoparasitoid, laid an egg on an early instar larva of E. gyrotis and emerged from the fourth instar larva. On the contrary, G. japonicus, which is an idiobiont ectoparasitoid, laid eggs on the fifth instar larvae of E. gyrotis more frequently than on the third and fourth instar larvae. Moreover, the sex ratio of the G. japonicus offspring was female-biased. The three species of primary idiobiont endoparasitoid, Brachymeria excarinata Gahan (Chalcididae), B. lasus (Walker), and Itoplectis alternans spectabilis (Matsumura)(Ichneumonidae), attacked the pupa of E. gyrotis. The lack of discrimination ability in the three species of the parasitoids between the parasitized and unparasitized hosts may result in inter- and intra-specific competition among the pupal primary parasitoids.

N2  - Adult food preference for two populations of the Indonesian phytophagous ladybird beetle, Epilachna sp. aff. emarginata Dieke was preliminarily investigated under uncontrolled room conditions. The two populations, that are known to show difference in host plant utilization patterns, were examined. Bogor population occurred on Mikania micrantha H.B.K. (Asteraceae) exclusively, and Cibinong population utilized Leucas lavandulifolia Smith (Labiatae) and M. micrantha. When beetles from each population were subjected to choice tests offering them M. micrantha and L. lavandulifolia simultaneously, beetles from the Bogor population and the "Mikania strain" of the Cibinong population preferred M. micrantha to L. lavandulifolia strongly, while the "Leucas strain" of the Cibinong population did not show a clear food preference. These results suggest that inter-and intra-populational differentiation in adult food preference exist.

N2  - Adult Conchapelopia collected in a stand using light-traps were classified into three species, which were distinguished only by the male genitalia. The male body sizes (wing length) of these species decreased consistently from spring to summer, and increased again in fall. When larvae from the bottom of small streams and ponds near the light-trapping site were reared, smaller adults emerged under high temperature conditions. In addition to body size, scutal marking patterns varied inter- and intraspecifically, ranging from no marking to entirely darkened vittae. In one species, males with darkened vittae tended to appear in relatively cold seasons. The implications of this finding for the taxonomic classification of this group are discussed.

N2  - The fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea Drury, maintained a bivoltine life cycle throughout its distribution range (39-34°N) for the first 20-30 years after its introduction in 1945 from U.S.A. At present, however, trivoltine populations occur in southwestern districts of the main islands, and multivoltine (more than three generations a year) populations in the Ogasawara Islands (ca. 27°N). The percentage diapause in three local strains with different life cycles under a 14-h daylength at 25℃ was highest in the bivoltine strain, intermediate in the trivoltine strain and lowest in the multivoltine strain. In spite of their divergent life cycles, all the Japanese populations are homologous in the DNA sequence of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. On the other hand, a native multivoltine strain from Florida indicated a substitution rate of 4.14% compared with Japanese populations. Therefore, the variation in voltinism has been established by natural selection after introduction and is not due to multiple introductions from different parts of U.S.A.

N2  - Although Heterotermes has been thought to be confined to tropical areas, some Chinese taxonomists suggest that this genus is also distributed in subtropical to temperate areas and treat some Chinese species as Heterotermes. We sequenced 677 bp of the mitochondrial COII gene of several Reticulitermes and Heterotermes species from Australia, France, China, Indonesia and Japan. The inferred molecular phylogeny showed that Heterotermes aculabialis from China and Reticulitermes species from various localities of the world formed a monophyletic group, suggesting that the Chinese Heterotermes aculabialis should be transferred to Reticulitermes. Our preliminary findings of the flagellate fauna in the hindgut of this species support this suggestion.

Eight different names have been used for them, and no combination between the primary-and secondary-host generations has been established. By sequencing their mitochondrial COII genes, we made it clear that three species occur in Japan : Hamamelistes miyabei (Matsumura) on Hamamelis japonica and Betula maximowicziana, Hamamelistes kagamii (Monzen) on H. japonica and B. grossa, and Hamamelistes betulinus (Horvath) on H. japonica, B. platyphylla, B. davurica and probably also on B. ermanii. The life cycles of the three species are reviewed, and synonyms are listed under the valid names.

N2  - The effects of photoperiod and temperature on nymphal development were examined in three subtropical populations of a cricket, Modicogryllus confirmatus Walker derived from Ishigaki Is., Yonaguni Is. and Okinawa Is. in the Ryukyu islands. The duration of nymphal development was longer when the photoperiod was shorter and the temperature lower. The development of nymphs reared at 13L(light)-11D(dark) showed a graded response to photoperiod ; the developmental rate was intermediate between the rates observed under short-day and long-day conditions, respectively. To determine if nymphal development at a short photoperiod was suppressed at a specific instar, head widths measured at various intervals after hatching were compared between short-day and long-day crickets. Nymphal development was suppressed at mid and/or late instars in short-day nymphs, indicating that these crickets entered diapause. No consistent difference was found in nymphal development between the long-winged and short-winged morphs. In spite of the small differences in latitude and temperature conditions between the collection sites, geographic variation was observed in nymphal development ; the higher the latitude the greater the degree of developmental retardation under short-day conditions.

N2  - Oviposition behavior of Echthrodelphax fairchildii females was observed. Mated females ceased moving their stings for 2-3.5s before inserting an egg when laying female eggs and for less than 1.5s when laying male eggs. Unmated females, when laying eggs, ceased moving their stings according to a bimodal distribution with maximums of about 1s and about 20s. These findings enabled identification of the sex of eggs and the mating status of females based on oviposition behavior. When ovipositing into 4th-instar hosts, each female, whether mated or unmated, showed pauses of sting movement of 1.8s or less with frequencies of around 86%. When ovipositing into 5th-instar hosts, each female showed short pause times with frequencies of about 6%. These findings present circumstantial evidence that E. fairchildii females have no memory of their mating status. Unmated females attempting to lay a female egg may be transferring sperm from the spermatheca to an egg in vain, resulting in a long pause time.

N2  - Contest competition between same-sex individuals is known to be an important component of sexual selection in burying beetles. In this study we examine morphological sex differences which we suggest are related to mating behavior. In two nicrophorine species, Nicrophorus orbicollis Say and Ptomascopus morio Kraatz, males possess longer leg segments, in relation to pronotal width, than do females. These sex differences are greatest for the tarsi, and of the tarsi, are greatest for the foreleg. The foretarsi of male nicrophorines also have more expanded pulvilli. Mating experiments using P. morio demonstrated that a male which is smaller than a female has difficulty completing a copulation attempt. We suggest that differences in leg morphology have been maintained by selection to increase mating ability of males. Females can attempt to reject copulations by holding their abdomen down, by a quick upward flip of the abdomen, or by running away from a male. Males employ their pretarsi as hooks to grasp the edge of the female's elytra when initiating copulation. This may present a difficult challenge when small males attempt to mate with large females.

N2  - Seasonal change in the flight behaviour of the satyrine butterfly Lethe diana was studied. The flight activity of this species had two peaks a day, with one peak in the morning and the other in the afternoon. The time of the peaks changed seasonally. L. diana flew late morning and early afternoon in spring and autumn, whereas early morning and late afternoon in summer. Consequently, flight occurred at the time of moderate temperature. The seasonal difference in temperatures at peaks of flight activity was slight. However, the temperatures at peaks in spring and autumn were still lower than those recorded in summer. The flight courses of the butterflies covered sunlit areas in spring but were limited to shaded areas in summer. Basking occurred in spring and autumn in order to increase body temperature by absorbing solar radiation. Changes in the time of flight activity and utilization of the solar radiation ensured thermoregulation under seasonally changing thermal conditions.

N2  - The life history of the torymid wasp Podagrion nipponicum was investigated under quasi-natural conditions. Adult wasps of the overwintering generation that emerged from egg cases of the praying mantis Tenodera aridifolia in April, laid eggs into unhatched egg cases of T. aridifolia and T. angustipennis. Adult wasps of the first generation emerged from these egg cases in late May to mid June. They laid eggs into unhatched egg cases of T. angustipennis. Adult wasps of the second generation emerged from these egg cases in late June to early July. Adult females lived longer than males in the first and second generations. Some females of the first and second generations survived until mid November, while none of the overwintering generation until late August. Adults of the second generation preferred newly-laid egg cases of T. aridifolia to those of T. angustipennis, when offered a choice between them in autumn. This result is consistent with the previous finding that no adult wasp of the overwintering generation emerged from overwintering egg cases of T. angustipennis in spring. Our results suggest that P. nipponicum has a multivoltine life cycle, and that its oviposition preference for egg cases of Tenodera species changes among generations.

N2  - The life history of the stream-dwelling bug Aphelocheirus vittatus was investigated in two populations of the Yoro and Niizaki Rivers, central Japan. The breeding season ranged from spring to autumn. The immature stages (egg+nymph+pre-oviposition period) were estimated to last for about 1.5 years. Adults live through two breeding seasons. Such longer immature and adult stages in A. vittatus and overwitering in all instars were unique in aquatic Heteroptera species.

N2  - Seasonal fluctuations in the percentage parasitism of Scirtothrips dorsalis by Megaphragma sp. were investigated in a Delaware vineyard in Osaka prefecture in 1998. Megaphragma sp. adults emerged from S. dorsalis eggs on grape leaves from July to September and the percentage parasitism reached 53.2% in late September. However, no Megaphragma sp. emerged from mid May to early July. This result suggests that the parasitoid was not effective as an agent for controlling the population density of S. dorsalis during the period when it causes the most damage to fruits in Delaware vineyards.

N2  - Portions of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) and nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA gene (28S rDNA) were sequenced using 30 species belonging to the superfamily Gerroidea and two outgroup taxa. Comparison of nucleotide sequences showed that both genes contain highly variable and flanking conserved regions and that it is sometimes difficult to align several portions within variable regions. Pairwise comparisons of the sequences showed that base substitutions were biased toward A-T transversions and C-T transitions in the 16S and 28S rDNA, respectively. Resolution of phylogenetic trees was relatively low when the 16S and 28S rDNA were analyzed separately, whereas it was improved when the two DNA sequences were combined. Bootstrap analyses using combined sequences supported monophylies of many of the taxonomic groupings. However, relationships between the Gerridae and Veliidae and among major clades within these families were not clearly resolved. Because a close adherence among these taxa was indicated by base substitutions in both of the independently evolved mitochondrial and nuclear rDNAs, such a relationship may be due to the evolutionary history of this insect group.

N2  - Two closely related pyraustine species, Ostrinia scapulalis and O. orientalis, are distinguished from each other by a difference in the male mid-tibia, although they are not distinguishable in other male features and in females. The present study showed that two forms of males that are morphologically identified as these two species emerged from a single brood together with females. No male with an intermediate condition of mid-tibia was contained in this brood. The emergence of two male forms corresponding to the two species was previously reported from another locality in Japan, and the present report is the second case. These findings suggest that the two species occasionally hybridize under natural conditions. Another possibility is that the two nominal species are actually conspecific, and thus the observed male dimorphism within broods represents a mere intraspecific variation. More studies including cross experiments and detailed information on their biology are needed to clarify the status of these two nominal species. O. scapulalis and O. orientalis are good material for studying the genetics and evolution of the male mid-tibial morphology in Ostrinia.

It is here excluded from the Lestremiinae and given subfamily rank of its own. The Catotrichinae subfam. n. are sister group of the remainder of the Cecidomyiidae, Lestremiinae s. str.+(Porricondylinae+Cecidomyiinae). The Lestremiinae in this new, strict sense are shown to be monophyletic, justified by a pecularity of their antennae. Details of the antennae, palpi and thorax in Catotricha are discussed phylogenetically and with consideration of homologous structures in other Mycetophiliformia. Catotricha fraterna sp. n. from Australia is described. Catotricha nipponensis (Alexander, 1924) from Japan is redescribed ; Catotricha antennata Alexander, 1959 is considered a junior synonym of nipponensis.

Thus, Pseudoscottiella was appropriately treated here as a junior synonym of Mepleres. Meniscopsocus Li, 1993 was newly synonymized with Mepleres. All new species combinations resulting from these taxonomic treatments were listed. Within Mepleres, African and Oriental-Pacific-Australian species groups had been recognized, with Mep. suzukii assigned to the latter group.

N2  - Cytological observations revealed that a chromosomal race with a sex determination system of XY/XX is included in the grasshopper Podisma sapporensis distributed in Hokkaido in addition to a race with a standard sex determination system of this genus. The standard race has a sex chromosome composition of XO/XX, with the diploid chromosome number being 23 (NF=23) in males and 24 (NF=24) in females. The XY/XX race is characterized by a diploid chromosome number of 22 in both males and females. It is probable that the XY/XX system resulted from X-autosome translocation, with the original acrocentric X-chromosome being altered into a metacentric neo-X chromosome. The XO/XX race is distributed in the western part of Hokkaido, while the distribution of the neo-XY/neo-XX race is restricted to the eastern part of Hokkaido. Hybridization between the two chromosomal races may have been hampered by geographical barriers such as Mts. Daisetsu and the Hidaka Range.

N2  - Male response in Electroantennogram (EAG) and in field attraction to females of the tussock moth Orgyia postica (Walker), of which females are wingless and unable to fly, were examined in two geographically separated populations from Okinawa Is. and Ishigaki Is. In the GC-EAG analyses, both the Okinawa and Ishigaki males showed a single EAG response to the extracts of Okinawa females and two EAG-responses to the extracts of Ishigaki females. On Okinawa Is., the catches of traps baited with Okinawa females were significantly larger than those baited with Ishigaki females. In Ishigaki Is., Okinawa females were also generally superior in capturing male moths as compared with the Ishigaki females. In field observations conducted on Okinawa Is., the attraction of males by Ishigaki females diminished after around 21 : 00, while that by Okinawa females continued thereafter. This suggests that Okinawa females may release more attractive sex pheromone, or the same pheromone but for a longer time, than the Ishigaki females.

N2  - Volatile compounds present in the extracts from the valvae and wings of male adults of thirteen Delias species were examined by GC and GC-MS analyses. A number of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons of varying carbon numbers were detected from the valva. Another characteristic compound (C_<18>H_<36>O) was also found from the valvae of twelve species as a predominant constituent in most species. In contrast, compounds detected from the wings included (E)-β-ocimene, diacetone alcohol, acetamide, farnesol, benzoic acid, methyl esters of fatty acids (C_<16>-C_<18>), saturated hydrocarbons and C_<18>H_<36>O together with large amounts of free fatty acids (C_<13>-C_<18>). The overall profile of these substances was more or less species-specific, suggesting the feasibility of chemotaxonomic consideration of Delias species based on them.

N2  - Pupae of the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea, entered diapause either as the second or third generation in Tsukuba, Japan. In the second generation, the incidence of diapause increased with the progress of season from early to late August, whereas all individuals of the third generation entered diapause in late autumn. Pupae in the two different generations overwintered and emerged as adults almost synchronously in the next spring. When diapause pupae were kept outdoors, the weight loss before overwintering was larger in pupae of the second generation than in those of the third generation. However, the weight loss during the winter was not different between the two generations. The rates of winter survival and egg production were higher in individuals from the third generation than in those from the second generation. Weight loss before overwintering and egg production were negatively correlated in females of the second generation, but not in those of the third generation. These results suggest that a reduction of energy reserves for overwintering and subsequent reproduction during the pre-hibernation period was larger in individuals entering diapause in the second generation than in those entering diapause in the third generation.

N2  - The willow leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora, overwinters in adult diapause. Its photoperiodic responses for diapause induction and termination were investigated at 22℃. All individuals entered diapause under short daylength, 10L-14D, but did not under long daylength, 16L-8D. The adult diapause, that was induced under short daylength, was terminated under long daylength. In the field at Ishikari, the ratios of females having mature ovarioles increased from late May to early June and decreased from mid-August to early September. This evidence may reflect the diapause termination under long daylengths of spring and the diapause induction under short daylengths of autumn.

N2  - Brachymeria lasus showed various responses to host (Mythimna separata) pupae with different treatments. In choice tests, when females were exposed to parasitized and unparasitized hosts, the mounting frequency to both hosts was not significantly different. However, they attacked (oviposited) the unparasitized hosts more frequently than the parasitized hosts. Female B. lasus discriminated between parasitized and unparasitized hosts when the oviposition for the parasitized hosts occurred at least one day earlier for both self and conspecific discrimination. In choices between unparasitized and physically-killed (by freezing or microwave) hosts, the females attacked the unparasitized hosts more frequently than the physically-killed hosts. However, when the females were given a choice between unparasitized and anesthetized hosts, they did not discriminate between the hosts. On the other hand, female B. lasus showed a higher response to pupal extracts of unparasitized than parasitized or freeze-killed hosts. These results suggest that host associated chemical (s) are important factors in discriminating between parasitized and unparasitized hosts by B. lasus.

N2  - This study investigated the feeding preferences of adults and larvae of Epilachna admirabilis to young and old leaves of Trichosanthes kirilowii var. japonica. Both adults and larvae preferred the young leaves to the old. Penetrometer showed that old leaves were about twice as hard as young leaves. Old leaves were scarcely fed on by both adults and larvae within short test periods but were well accepted by them during 24hr. In rearing tests that provided young and old leaves for larvae as food, there was no obvious difference in growth performance. The no-choice assay with methanol extracts of young and old leaves showed that both adults and larvae were stimulated to feed by young and old leaf extracts. The choice assay revealed that larvae much preferred the extract of old leaves to that of young leaves compared with adults. These results indicate that the chemical feeding stimulant and physical toughness in old leaves are related to the difference in feeding preferences between adults and larvae.

N2  - Two types of Eurema hecabe (L.) sympatrically inhabit the subtropical Okinawa-jima Island, southeastern of mainlands of Japan. They differ in the fringe color of forewings (brown-and yellow-type), which is linked with seasonal morph expression in response to environmental cues. In the present paper, whether the ability of host-plant utilization in these sympatric types may differ were experimentally investigated using five host-plant species. When females of the brown-type were simultaneously exposed to five species of hosts, relative frequency of oviposition was high on Ormocarpum cochinchinense and Cassia surattensis (natural hosts), but low on Lespedeza cuneata and Berchemia lineata (non-natural hosts). By contrast, when females of the yellow-type were exposed to the plant species, it was high on L. cuneata or B. lineata (natural hosts), but low on O. cochinchinense and C. surattensis (non-natural hosts). Proportion of feeding larvae and survival rate by pupation on each plant species tested differed between two types, and were higher on the hosts chosen by females of the same type than on the hosts utilized by those of the other type. On Albizia julibrissin, unfamiliar host for both types, females of each type laid down considerable number of eggs, and larval perfomance was good. The results strongly suggest that the ability of host use differs between two sympatric types of E. hecabe on this Island.

N2  - The effect of three species of aphidophagous ladybirds, Coccinella septempunctata, Harmonia axyridis, and Propylea japonica, on oviposition of an aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani, was assessed in the bean aphid, Aphis craccivora, in relation to physical presence, visual cues or larval tracks of ladybirds. Female parasitoids responded to the presence of a ladybird larva by reducing the number of eggs laid in the patch, but visual cues of larvae did not affect the oviposition. Effect of larval tracks on parasitism was selective among species ; C. septempunctata larval tracks significantly reduced parasitism, but the same was not true for the larval tracks of H. axyridis and P. japonica. As parasitized aphids are also at risk of predation by predatory ladybirds, therefore, it is advantageous for female parasitoids to avoid aphid patches which contain these predators. Significance of such an oviposition response is also discussed.

N2  - This study examined the species compositions of the parasitoid complex associated with eight sorts of cynipid galls on three coexisting Fagaceae species and the life-history traits of the dominant parasitoid and inquiline species. Fourteen parasitoid species of the superfamily Chalcidoidea and one inquiline cynipid species of the genus Synergus emerged from the galls collected. Seven parasitoid species and Synergus sp. were recorded from two or more sorts of galls. Twelve parasitoid species were classified into five primary parasitoids and seven facultative hyperparasitoids according to the host types of parasitoid. The primary parasitoids, Megastigmus nipponicus and Cynipencyrtus flavus, had clear peaks of adult emergence from galls, suggesting the synchrony of their seasonal occurrences with those of growth stages of their hosts. The facultative hyperparasitoids, Eurytoma brunniventris and Eupelmus urozonus, consecutively emerged from various sorts of galls, suggesting no synchrony with any particular host. Thus, the differences in life-history traits between the primary parasitoids and the facultative hyperparasitoids might be due to the differences of their ranges of host species. The emergence of the inquiline, Synergus sp., differed from those of the primary parasitoids in generally emerging from the gall of each cynipid species during one particular period, suggesting that the species synchronizes its emergence and oviposition periods with the growth and differentiation stage of galls limited in time.

N2  - No gall of the aphid Colophina clematicola has hitherto been found despite the fact that its woolly colonies are rather commonly found on the secondary host, Clematis terniflora, in Japan. We collected sexuparae of the aphid from the secondary host in autumn and transferred them to a potted tree of Zelkova serrata. Several leaf-rolled galls were formed in the following year, and one of them produced alate emigrants in September. The number of male embryos in each sexupara was not constant, as was predicted from the bad-gene hypothesis. First-instar nymphs of the gall generation attacked a maggot that had been introduced onto the surface of a gall. The gall generation of C. clematicola are described.

When lepidopteran larvae were introduced into the galls, they were aggressively attacked by a number of 1st instar nymphs. No remarkable morphological differences were recognized between attacking and non-attacking 1st instar nymphs. It was suggested that 1st instar span of gall inhabitants is extremely prolonged.

N2  - Morphological differences were found between workers with undeveloped ovaries and an empty spermatheca, and females with developed ovaries in two colonies of Polybia occidentalis collected in Ribeirao Preto, southeastern Brazil. Among females with developed ovaries, inseminated females are designated as queens and uninseminated ones as intermediates. Mean sizes of most body parts of queens including alitrunk length, were larger than those of workers. Mahalanobis distances calculated in canonical discriminant analysis, as well as basic statistics, indicate that intermediates are morphologically closer to queens than to workers, a result rather unusual among so far observed epiponines.

N2  - Records of specimens suggesting cleptoparasitism of Poecilagenia sculpturata (Kohl) on Auplopus carbonarius (Scopoli) are reviewed, and the cleptoparasitic behavior of this species is described. In her searching behavior, female P. sculpturata repeatedly uses the antennae by applying them to the substrate near where other pompilids are nesting. The flagellar sensilla of this species are observed by SEM, and the following types of sensilla are found : sensilla placodea, sensilla basiconica A, pit organs, sensilla campaniformia, sensilla trichodea A, B, C, and sensilla spatulata. The structure of the antenna and sensilla of P. sculpturata is compared with that of A. carbonarius. The female P. sculpturata has a shorter and stouter fusiform flagellum with denser sensilla basiconica A on its anteroventral side. Similar structures are found in cleptoparasitic pompilids, Evagetes species. These structures are considered to have evolved due to convergence as an adaption to the cleptoparasitic mode of life. The sensilla basiconica A are presumed to play the most important role in locating the host or paralyzed spider.

The adults including the male and female genitalia are redescribed. The biology and morphology of immature stages are described for the first time. The larva was found to feed on the leaves of Quercus aliena, Q. serrata, and occasionally on Q. acutissima, forming a portable case. The case is similar to that of Vespina quercivora (Davis, 1972), being of oval sections cut from the host leaves. The mature larva was remarkably different in morphology from the preceding instar.

N2  - GC-MS analyses revealed more than 40 hydrocarbons in the hexane fraction from silica gel column chromatography of female elytra extract, which evoked mating behavior in male Anoplophora malasiaca when blended with the ether fraction. When the hexane fraction was separated into saturated, monoenyl, dienyl and trienyl fractions by column chromatography on silica gel impregnated with silver nitrate, only the fraction that contained saturated hydrocarbon showed pheromonal activity when mixed with the ether fraction. This activity was comparable with that observed when the mixture of the eight major synthetic hydrocarbons was blended. The eight major hydrocarbons were n-heptacosane, n-nonacosane, 4-methylhexacosane, 4-methyloctacosane, 9-methylheptacosane, 9-methylnonacosane, 15-methylhentriacontane and 15-methyltritriacontane. These hydrocarbons were indicated to be the components of the contact sex pheromone in A. malasiaca, which works together with an unknown polar component(s).

N2  - Eobiana japonica (formerly Metrioptera japonica) requires two or more years to complete its life cycle by entering diapause twice in the egg stage. Initial diapause occurs just after blastoderm formation and the final diapause shortly before hatching. The initial diapause lasted for more than a year in some eggs. The percentage of initial-diapause termination increased on the whole as the duration of exposure to 3℃ increased from 15 to 600 days. The intensity of initial diapause was considerably variable among individuals. Chilling longer than 600 days impaired the egg viability. Cold treatment was not indispensable to terminate the initial diapause because some or most eggs resumed development at constant temperatures between 15 and 30℃. Repeated exposure to low (90 days at 10℃ or 180 days at 3℃) and high temperatures (90 or 180 days at 25℃) was more effective than a single long cold treatment in terminating the initial diapause, and all the eggs resumed development after two or three such cycles.

N2  - The effects of aging, photoperiod and temperature on testis development in the Asian comma butterfly Polygonia c-aureum were examined in connection with adult diapause and overwintering. Photoperiods during larval, pupal and imaginal stages did not exert pronounced influences on testis development, indicating that testis development is not influenced by diapause (i.e. controlled photoperiodically). Larval testes size increased with time until the end of the pupal stage, and thereafter began to decrease, especially during the first month of adulthood. When adults were kept under short day length (SD) and three different temperatures (15℃, 21℃ or 25℃) after adult eclosion, the rate of testis shrinkage was lowest at 15℃. Irrespective of timing (15 or 45 days of adult age) and duration (1, 2 or 3 months) of chilling at 5℃, the size of shrunken testis remained nearly constant throughout the post-chilling period at 21℃. Field examination also showed that testis size after overwintering as well as in late autumn before overwintering remained small. These results suggest that testis shrinkage ceases before or during overwintering. After ecdysed to the final (fifth) larval instar, a yellow membrane covered the testes and began to degenerate at the end of the pupal stage. The timing of yellow membrane degeneration coincided with the commencing of testis shrinkage, apyrene sperm movement from testis to post-testicular organs, and reduction of apyrene spermiogenesis. Therefore, it is suggested that there is a distinct possibility of the yellow membrane being involved in these reproductive events of the testis.

N2  - Under field conditions, newly-emerged adults of Dyscerus hylobioides showed a high feeding rate in mid-summer, but this declined rapidly. After hibernation, feeding was resumed in early spring and continued until late autumn. Most newly-emerged females did not lay eggs during the year of emergence, and overwintered females laid eggs from late spring to early autumn. Most adults survived over a second spring and, as a matter of course, they could lay eggs. The longest life span was 46 months. At 20℃ and 25℃, post-diapause females continued oviposition over 250-500 days under long photoperiods, but diapause was induced again under short photoperiods after about 65-110 days from the start of incubation. Diapause reinduced under short photoperiods was again terminated by transfer to a long photoperiod in the laboratory. Newly-emerged females kept at 25℃ needed a long period of time (more than 60 days) before ovipositing under long photoperiods (LD 15 : 9 and 14 : 10), but they did not lay eggs under short photoperiods (LD 13 : 11 and 12 : 12). Thus, new females could avert diapause and oviposit in the field during the year of their emergence only if they emerge in the earliest part of the season (by July). Oviposition activities of adults transferred periodically from outdoor conditions to an incubator regulated at 20℃ throughout the winter suggest that the diapause of overwintering adults was terminated by mid-January in the field, since after that time the incubation period until the start of oviposition under diapause-maintaining short photoperiod (LD 12 : 12) was equal to that under diapause-terminating long photoperiod (LD 15 : 9).

N2  - The life cycle and reproductive development of the chrysomelid, Ophraella communa, were investigated in the field and laboratory. Females stopped ovarian development and gradually accumulated lipids, mainly triacylglycerols, in mid August through late September, suggesting that the female adults shifted from the non-diapause to diapause phase during this period. Adult diapause was induced at a 14-h or shorter photoperiod. Although mating occurred during early adulthood under any photoperiodic conditions, both sexes at a short day photoperiod built up fat reserves, stopped feeding and tended to hide themselves under objects. These results, together with field surveys, appear to indicate that the beetles mate in the autumn, feed intensively to accumulate fat reserves and then leave the host plant for hibernacula shortly before winter.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine life history characteristics of Diadromus subtilicornis, a pupal parasitoid of diamondback moth, using the two parasitoid strains collected from Morioka and Akashi, Japan. Developmental time from oviposition to emergence decreased with increasing temperature with either 16L : 8D or 12L : 12D. Longevity of both sexes decreased with increasing temperature. Females lived longer than males at the same temperatures and photoperiods. Females reared at 25℃ with 16L : 8D had no mature eggs at day 0. The number of mature eggs per female increased up to 5 by day 5, and then decreased after day 15 although they had no access to hosts. These results indicate that they resorb mature eggs and avert egg maturation when deprived of hosts for a long period. When given hosts and honey solution with 16L : 8D, females lived shorter and produced fewer progeny at 30℃ than at either 20℃ or 25℃. When given hosts daily only after day 20 or day 35 at 25℃ with 16L : 8D, females produced fewer progeny than females given hosts daily since adult emergence. Longevity of 35-day host-deprived females was longer than that of undeprived females and of 20-day host-deprived females, indicating extension of longevity due to reproductive suppression. Considering the plasticity of their life history, combined with their long lifespans and capacity to attack a few hosts a day for an extended period, D. subtilicornis could be used for prevention of buildup of diamondback moth populations in early summer in Japan.

N2  - The competition between the burying beetle Nicrophorus quadripunctatus and the blow fly Chrysomya pinguis for carcasses as a reproductive resource was examined with mouse carcasses in the laboratory after removing all phoretic mites from beetles. Adult pairs of N. quadripunctatus succeeded in reproduction with carcasses containing fly eggs or larvae. When flies were in the egg stage or first larval instar, beetles killed or removed them completely from the carcasses. When flies had already reached the third larval instar when beetles were introduced, however, a few larvae escaped from being killed by the beetles and became puparia in some cases. Therefore, the phoretic mites of N. quadripunctatus are not indispensable to removal of fly eggs or larvae from the carcass for reproduction of the beetle. N. quadripunctatus shows remarkably successful reproduction in competition with flies as compared to other Nicrophorus species that show no or low levels of reproductive success in carcasses containing fly larvae.

N2  - Burying beetles bury carcasses which will become food for their young. I tested whether burying beetles (Nicrophorus vespilloides) reduce fly infestation by burial or maintenance (rolling and treatment with secretions) of carcasses. The number of carcasses that harbored dipteran larvae was very low when the carcasses exposed previously to oviposition by flies were processed by N. vespilloides. It was also low when the carcasses were exposed to flies after they were buried by N. vespilloides. Moreover, field observations revealed that buried carcasses were less attractive to flies than exposed ones. Thus, I conclude that N. vespilloides reduces infestation of carcasses by burial and/or maintenance.

N2  - A total of 80 drosophilid species representing 16 genera were collected during our surveys in Iriomote-jima. About 65% of them were subtropical or tropical species, about 30% were inhabitants of subtropical to temperate areas, and the rests were cosmopolitan species. Fruits, flowers, fungi and leaves were observed to be used by drosophilids for breeding. This island was rich in fruit feeders but poor in herbage feeders compared with temperate areas. Habitat selection and seasonal fluctuations were studied by trap collections using fermenting banana as baits. Drosophilid species collected by this method were mainly fruit feeders. They were subdivided into three groups, species living mainly in forests, those in domestic areas, and those in open land, domestic areas, and/or forest canopy. Many species decreased in number of individuals from February to May or June, but some species increased during this period. In most species, reproductively mature females were collected even in winter, suggesting that they do not have hibernal reproductive diapause. However, females of Drosophila daruma collected from autumn to winter usually had undeveloped ovaries ; this species may enter reproductive diapause.

N2  - Food preference was studied for drosophilid flies in domestic and forest areas of central Japan using artificially prepared resources (fruits, flowers, leaves, stems and mushrooms). The similarity of food preference was high among species occurring in domestic areas, especially among Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans and D. lutescens and between D. auraria and D. immigrans. On the other hand, species occurring in forests usually differed in food preference from each other ; D. immigrans and D. lutescens preferred succulent fruits ; D. rufa used a variety of resources except for mushrooms ; D. bizonata preferred mushrooms ; D. sternopleuralis used a variety of substrates except for succulent fruits ; Scaptodrosophila coracina used a variety of substrates. This difference is assumed to play an important role in the maintenance of their coexistence. The rate of parasitism by wasps was generally high in larvae feeding on fruits and flowers, but low in those feeding on stems of Sasaella ramosa.

N2  - The life cycle and sociality of the halictine bee, Lasioglossum (Lasioglossum) scitulum were studied in a greenhouse at Matsue (lat. 35°22′N), south-western Japan in 1988 and 1989. This species was a bivoltine bee with solitary to primitively social behavior. During the summer brooding period of 1988, 51 solitary nests and 8 multi-female nests (3 matrifilial and 5 sororal nests) were discovered. In 1989, 11 multi-female nests (3 matrifilial and 8 sororal nests), together with 59 solitary nests were also found. Although summer females mostly dispersed and nested solitarily, some of them stayed in their natal nests and formed sororal social nests. When oviposition by mother bees was extended until the emergence of her daughters, matrifilial nests were formed. Multi-female nests usually were composed of 2 cohabitants. Task allocation between them was relatively distinct in foraging activity. Usually, both cohabitants had well developed ovaries, suggesting that they both were egg-layers. Reproductive efficiency (=number of provisioned cells produced/day/female) in the sororal nests was conspicuously lower than that in the solitary nests. Probably, multi-female nests arise accidentally when more than one female remained in their natal nests. The lack of some social traits such as ovarian inhibition and behavioral conflict indicates that L. scitulum is basically solitary species.

N2  - I examined the effects of frass covering the overwintering eggs of andromeda lace bug, Stephanitis takeyai Drake et Maa, on egg parasitization by the wasp, Anagrus takeyanus Gordh et Dunbar. When the wasp was excluded by fine meshed gauze during ovipositional period, the hatchability of eggs was nearly 1.0. Therefore, if the frass cover reduces parasitization rate, it would directly increases the fitness of the mother. The estimated rate was significantly lower in egg masses covered by frass (0.72) than in uncovered egg masses (0.82). Though the egg mass size was significantly larger in the masses with cover (48.6) than that without cover (27.8), there was no positive or negative relationship between egg-mass size and parasitization rate. Therefore, at least in the winter season, parasitization by the wasp is the main mortality factor of the eggs, and frass cover on the egg mass functions as a parasitization avoidance mechanism.

N2  - We analyzed the geographic pattern of body size variation in five species belonging to the subgenera Leptocarabus and Adelocarabus in the genus Leptocarabus (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in the Japanese Archipelago. Except for L. (L.) hiurai in Shikoku, these species are parapatric or partially sympatric with each other. In all four species, the northeastern populations had larger bodies than the southwestern populations, while in any two parapatric species the southwestern species had larger bodies than the northeastern species. We called this type of geographic variation the "toppled-domino pattern". Within each species, body size was positively correlated with the annual mean temperature of the locality (the converse of Bergmann's rule). The toppled-domino pattern resulted from (1) interspecific differences in the altitudinal range at the boundary zone, where southwestern species occurred at lower altitudes than northeastern species, and (2) intraspecific regional differences in body size, in which northeastern populations have larger bodies than southwestern populations under the same temperature conditions. In L. (L.) procerulus and L. (A.) arboreus from Honshu, the interspecific difference in mean body size at sympatric sites was greater in cooler habitats. This trend was more evident in central Honshu, where there are alpine zones, than in northern Honshu, where there are no alpine zones. We hypothesize that the observed geographic patterns of intra- and interspecific body size variation resulted from (1) climatic adaptation during colonization and range shift by Leptocarabus through the glacial and inter-glacial periods, and (2) the effects on body size evolution of interspecific interactions in a contact zone.

N2  - The phylogeny of the genus Luehdorfia (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae) in the East Asia was examined by a molecular approach. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among four species of the genus, partial nucleotide sequences (785 base pairs) of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene were compared. The results indicated that Luehdorfia japonica diverged initially from the ancestral stock of the genus Luehdorfia, and that then the ancestral stock successively yielded L. chinensis, L. longicaudata and L. puziloi. These findings suggest that L. japonica might immigrate first among the Luehdorfia butterflies into the area of the current Japanese Archipelago after the intrusion of Asarum as the food plant of L. japonica. The phylogeny of the genus Luehdorfia is discussed.

N2  - In the genus Pieris (Lepidoptera : Pieridae), scent scales are widely distributed in the male wings. We made a detailed study of the scent scale arrangement in the wings of the small white cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae, by examining sockets, which are small attachment points of scales. Scent scales form rows between those of the ordinary scales in the anteroposterior direction of the wings. Most scent scales are evenly distributed within the rows, but some are separated by much larger intervals. The density of the scent scales is about 180 scales per mm^2 in the forewing, and about 130 per mm^2 in the hindwing. Its ratio to that of the ordinary scales is about 0.4 in the forewing, and about 0.3 in the hindwing. The ratio in the part where scent scales are evenly distributed within the rows is about 0.5 both in the forewing and in the hindwing. The distribution region of scent scales in the whole wing is definitely outlined. These results provide bases for studies of differentiation and arrangement development of scent scales in the pupal wing epidermis.

N2  - Water strider flight activity and reproduction was studied in central Alberta, Canada using marking and weekly census over 16 years (1984-99), flight trapping, flight-muscle dissection and experiments. Gerris buenoi Kirkaldy and Limnoporus dissortis Drake & Harris reproduced at near replacement levels on the focal pond ; Gerris comatus Drake & Hottes and Gerris pingreensis Drake & Hottes were generally less successful, despite consistent spring immigration by flight. Flights were observed in four seasonally distributed categories. Category 1 flights to and from terrestrial diapause sites were made in association with overwintering in all species. Most gerrids overwintered at terrestrial sites distant from natal ponds ; a small proportion of G. buenoi over-wintered close to the focal pond and moved overland to and from these sites as did many of the long-winged (LW) Aquarius remigis Say that arrived late in the season. LW colonists of G. pingreensis appeared during the first few weeks after ice-off and generally left only a few progeny, c. 68% of which were also LW. A few adults of A. remigis also flew to the focal pond in spring, but all emigrated without reproducing. Category 2 flights of reproductively active, overwintered individuals of G. buenoi, and L. dissortis were made between ponds, starting in mid-May and continuing into mid-July. Flight activity varied linearly with temperature during the main period of category 2 flights, with no flight activity observed below 13℃. Flight-muscle histolysis truncated category 2 flights during May for G. pingreensis and a little later for G. comatus. Category 3 flights were made by LW direct breeders of G. buenoi, G. comatus and L. dissortis that colonized temporary ponds re-filled by thunderstorms in June and July. If the pond did not dry out, per capita reproductive success of such flying direct breeders was 2-10 times that of the average observed for overwintered breeders 1984-1999. Category 4 flights were made by pre-diapause adults of A. remigis, G. buenoi and L. dissortis arriving at the focal pond after mid-summer. Females of all four pond-dwelling species flew with large numbers of mature eggs, showing that flight and reproduction are not mutually exclusive ; however, early in the season females of G. buenoi and G. pingreensis that histolysed flight-muscles carried, respectively, 25.7 and 33.6% more eggs than those retaining flight ability. In addition to the well established ideas that flight ability is favored in physically temporary habitats, probable advantages for retention of flight include use of the best foraging opportunities by pre-reproductive adults, escape from natural enemies, and bet-hedging reproductive strategies, especially in relation to natural enemy impacts.

N2  - Lasius fuliginosus workers were observed to be aggressive towards foreign workers with menacing, turning on and biting, whereas they were calm to nestmate workers with antennation and occasional regurgitation. The workers, however, alerted to a nestmate lodged at the foreigner's nest for two weeks even though the nestmate never had direct body contact with the foreigners. They menaced and turning on towards the nestmate, but immediately lost aggressiveness when they contacted the nestmate with their antennae. In contrast, the workers appeared to pay no attention to a foreigner lodged at their own nest for two weeks before contacting it. But they suddenly turned to be aggressive towards the foreigner when they brushed it in passing. Without such body contact, the workers responded aggressively towards not a nestmate but a foreigner, when the nestmate and the foreigner lodged at their own nest and the foreigner's nest, respectively. This evidences suggest the existence of both volatile and non-volatile signals serving as nestmate recognition cue in L. fuliginosus, and the volatile signals may serve as a transient cue while the non-volatile signal may be more critical for nestmate recognition.

N2  - SIM-GC-Mass analysis demonstrated only the presence of JH II in the haemolymph of Spodoptera litura reared in crowded conditions. JH II level decreased dramatically near final larval ecdysis and was undetectable one day after the ecdysis. Northern blot analysis of the fat body total RNA revealed that the transcription of genes encoding the two basic and methionine-rich storage proteins, SL-1 and SL-2, started 24 hr after the ecdysis, nearly at the time of their first appearance in the haemolymph. The synthesis was suppressed by the injection of JH analogue, methoprene to the newly ecdysed larvae. Methoprene injection 24 hr after ecdysis had no affect. The latter treatment shortened the instar duration without uptake of three storage proteins from the haemolymph by the fat body and induced supernumerary ecdysis to seventh instar. These results suggest that the synthesis of SL-1 and SL-2 are suppressed by JH II at the pre-transcription level, and that the disappearance of JH II triggers the transcription of their genes whereby the transcription becomes refractory to JH thereafter. Methoprene treatment had no effect on the other storage protein, SL-3 (arylphorine).

N2  - Temperature-dependent development of the larval endoparasitoid, Venturia canescens, was studied in vivo and in vitro at 5 constant temperatures between 17 and 33℃. When Ephestia kuehniella was used as a host, successful parasitism was observed at 21, 25 and 29℃. As in the in vivo observation, many of the last instar larvae were obtained in a culture medium at 21, 25 and 29℃. The low thermal threshold for development of V. canescens during the period from embryo to the last instar in vitro was estimated at 12.4℃, which was ca. 1℃ lower than the value for in vivo development from oviposition to larval emergence from host (13.6℃). This is the first report in which the low thermal threshold for development of the parasitoid was investigated using in vitro culture technique. This information may contribute to future studies on the parasitoid biology.

N2  - In the tussock moth Euproctis taiwana (Shiraki), mating occurred intensively during dawn light, but the phoretic egg parasitoid, Telenomus euproctidis Wilcox, became behaviorally active only during the day. E. taiwana egg masses that were covered with scale hair derived from the anal tuft of the female moth were heavily parasitized by T. euproctidis. In the field, more parasitoids were attracted to the scale-hair wad derived from the female anal tuft after pheromone release than before pheromone release. This attractiveness, however, decreased after hexane rinse. GC analyses confirmed that sex pheromone was extracted from the scale hair of anal tufts of virgin females. It was exposed to the air in the laboratory for 24h after pheromone release. The amount of pheromone in the extract was 13-36ng/female immediately after pheromone release but decreased to 2.7ng/female after 12h of exposure, and to the noise level of FID recording (<0.5ng/female) thereafter. GC-EAG analyses, however, revealed that male moth antennae apparently detected trace pheromone amount even after 48h. In the field, scale-hair wads rinsed three times in hexane and treated with synthetic moth sex pheromone seemed to attract more parasitoids with increasing amounts of pheromone (0.1 to 10ng/hair wad). This indicates that trace amounts of pheromone were adsorbed to, retained on and released from the anal tufts of female moth and scale hair covering egg masses after oviposition, and that they provided kairomonal cues for host location by the parasitoid.

The insect was thought to be partially bivoltine, with three adult emergence periods superficially recognized and with two overwintering stages realized. Adult survivorship and oviposition schedule were described quantitatively. The larvae were kept either singly or in groups and fed an artificial diet. The grouped larvae showed cannibalism from the 2nd instar onwards. Differences in life cycle, adult body size, egg size and egg color between the Japanese race and the nominate race from Sumatra were discussed.

N2  - Lammas shoots are relatively unpredictable food resources for insect herbivores, since the shoots are produced late in the season as a compensatory reaction to defoliation by herbivores and to other factors. A monophagous gall midge, Tokiwadiplosis matecola was confirmed, both in Kagoshima and in Okinawa, to make galls in June-July on lammas shoots alone, instead of on normal spring shoots of Lithocarpus edulis, an evergreen tree of the family Fagaceae. Tokiwadiplosis matecola required relatively high temperatures for larval development after overwintering. Such a requirement explained why the emergence of T. matecola does not synchronize with the appearance of spring shoots in April-May. At least 50% of L. edulis trees in the forest produced some lammas shoots, chiefly from the coppices and stems on lower parts, providing T. matecola with galling sites constantly. At least 60% of the lammas shoots were galled every year from 1993 to 1995. The high percentage of galled lammas shoots indicated possible regulation of the gall midge density by the amount of lammas shoots produced. Tokiwadiplosis matecola is normally univoltine, but some individuals exhibited an additional generation relying upon the continuous production of lammas shoots in August-September.

N2  - Bumble bees constantly visit plant species of the most rewarding flowers recognized by learning, majors, and rarely visit other flowering species, minors. Majors are thought to be switched as their rewards decrease. This foraging system suggests that the reward collection rate is related with major-switching. To test this prediction, we observed 14 series of foraging trips of Bombus ardens in a forest habitat and monitored 193 trips of eight workers in 122-h observation. We measured weight of load gain and duration of trips, and examined taxonomic make-up of collected pollen grains. The examined pollen belonged to 27 plant species, and 15 species were regarded as majors because their pollen grains were most abundant in pollen loads. We also confirmed flower visitation to most of the majors in the foraging area. In 23 of 50 observed cases of major-switching, bumble bees switched back to the latest majors. This result indicates repeated switching between limited plant taxa. The load gain rate was not correlated with similarity of taxonomic make-up of pollen loads between consecutive foraging trips. This result did not support the predicted relationship between the load gain rate and major-switching.

N2  - Colonies of an Australian swarm-founding paper wasp, Ropalidia romandi, were artificially disturbed to induce absconding swarms. Workers initiated the migration and queens immigrated into a new nesting site in the later stage of a migration event. On the initial nest founded by a swarm of wasps, workers laid eggs while no oviposition by queens occurred. Dissection of females for ovaries indicated that the proportion of workers with developed oocytes ("egg-laying" workers) increased a few days after the initiation of swarm migration, and that about one-third of workers participating in the swarm had developed oocytes. Workers frequently encircled a queen (royal court) ; the proportion of egg-laying individuals in encircling workers was significantly higher than in the overall proportion in the workers that participated in the swarm. A court apparently functioned to prevent queens from having access to the new combs and, thus, from laying eggs. A court on an initial nest was often accompanied by aggressive behavior of encircling workers toward the queen.

N2  - In the Australian swarm-founding wasp Ropalidia romandi cabeti, all females dissected (900 individuals from 3 colonies) had 3 pairs of ovarioles. But, according to ovarian types and insemination, they were classified into queens, intermediates and workers. Colonies 1 and 2 from Brisbane had the 3 types of females, while colony 3 from Atherton lacked the intermediate form. Percentages of queens in the samples varied from 0.7% in Colony 1, through 3.7% in Colony 2 to 49.7% in Colony 3. Estimated numbers of queens of Colonies 1, 2 and 3 were 13, 100 and 2500, respectively, probably reflecting the stage of colonial development. Statistic analyses based on measurements of 23 body characters showed that queens were larger than workers and intermediates. Intermediates were morphologically more similar to workers than to queens. Canonical discriminant analyses revealed that queens, intermediates and workers were morphometrically separated in varying degrees by colonies.

Illustrations are provided of structural features and chaetotaxy. The larva of O. danjo may be distinguished from those of other Palearctic species of the subgenus Ochthebius found in maritime rock-pools by the shape of the egg-bursters and the absence of subprimary setae on the thoracic segments. It clearly differs from the larvae of the subgenus Cobalius of Ochthebius and from the larvae of the genus Calobius in having anal hooks.

Some morphs of the aphid were described based on Japanese materials. Our collection data indicate that the species is momoecious and holocyclic on S. altissima in Japan, but apterous viviparae also hibernate on the plant in the southern Kanto District, central Japan. The hibernating aphids were slightly different from the normal ones in some morphological characters.

N2  - Induction of antimicrobial peptide synthesis in the blowfly, Calliphora vicina is analyzed using hemolymph antibacterial activity assay, HPLC mapping and structural characterization. The data obtained demonstrate that diapause maggots enhance their immune response to septic injury as compared to postdiapause larvae and pupae. Antimicrobial peptides produced during diapause comprise defensins, diptericins, cecropin and proline-rich peptides. However, some antimicrobial peptides specific to developing pupae were not found during diapause. The results support the view that insect diapause is not merely an interruption of the developmental program but a sophisticated adaptation involving defense mechanisms such as induction of antimicrobial peptides synthesis.

N2  - Information on the role of moisture in diapause and related behaviors in a fungus beetle, Stenotarsus rotundus (Endomychidae), is reviewed. In the tropical rainforest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, adults of this beetle form a large aggregation on the stem of a palm tree, Oenocarpus panamanus. They stay in dormancy on the tree for as long as 10 months each year, covering about 6 months of wet season plus 4 months of dry season. Photoperiod plays an important role in diapause termination. However, this response does not explain the annual variation in the timing of diapause termination. A gradual increase in humidity during the second half of the dry season enhances their response to increasing photoperiod. This moisture response appears to constitute an adaptation to the unpredictable onset of the wet season. Mating and dispersal from the aggregation site do not take place until the first heavy rain falls at the beginning of the wet season. Beetles taken from the tree before the rain mated in an outdoor screened insectary without being exposed to high moisture. Neither drinking water nor high humidity was required. The metabolic rate decreases as group size increases. A decrease in metabolic rate can also be achieved by elevating relative humidity, thus suggesting that one function of the aggregation is to increase humidity within the group and thereby decrease metabolic rate and water loss. S. rotundus has evolved various mechanisms to cope with fluctuations and unpredictability in environmental moisture.

N2  - The water strider Aquarius paludum is distributed widely in the palearctic region (Andersen, 1990) and inhabits both permanent and temporary water bodies (Harada et al., 1997). A. paludum is a very successful species that can adapt to a wide variety of habitats. This mini-review suggests that this wide habitat is caused by its flexible responses to the important environmental factors. Populations of A. paludum in Kochi (133°N, 33°E) are used as a model, because they show trivoltinism and dynamic seasonal variation in life history. Environmental factors which are predictable or unpredictable can control its life history. Indeed, constant long days induce short wings and reproduction, whereas constant short days induce long wings and diapause, and the critical photoperiod for wing morphs is longer by 1 hour than that for reproduction. High temperature of 30℃ in nymphal stage and moderate temperature of 25℃ after emergence induce rapid maturation of flight ability within the first 5 imaginal days and promote the histolysis of flight muscles and reproductive maturation during the next week. In the Kochi strain of A. paludum, high population density during the nymphal stage delays the histolysis of flight muscles. A step-wise decrease of photophase by 1 or 2 hrs in total during the nymphal period results in critical photoperiods longer by 1 hour for both determination of wing morphs and reproduction. On the other hand, an increase of photophase promotes the histolysis of flight muscles and reduces flight propensity, at least after 40 days of imaginal life. Integrated control of life history by these several factors in natural populations of A. paludum in Kochi is discussed. Overwintered and reproductive adults of A. paludum had larger corpora allata than diapause adults in fall in a Czech population. Juvenile hormone from the corpus allatum may be involved in the control of the reproductive system as in other insects.

N2  - Evolution of life history in ecological interactions was reviewed using inter-population variation in the life cycle of a polyphagous herbivore, Stephanitis takeyai (Heteroptera : Tingidae) and its egg parasitoid, Anagrus takeyanus (Hymenoptera : Mymaridae). In a study site in a typical secondary forest in Kyoto, S. takeyai showed a seasonal host-plant alternation between its main host plants, the evergreen Pieris japonica and the deciduous Lyonia ovalifolia. In another site in Nara Park, there were few L. ovalifolia plants, and S. takeyai exploited P. japonica throughout the year. The flora of Nara Park has been simplified by heavy herbivory by deer, which have long been conserved as holy animals. Therefore, the current life cycle of S. takeyai in Nara Park would have been derived from a host-alternating life cycle. However, from an interspecific comparison, non-host-alternating life cycle was thought to be the ancestral state in this species. Corresponding to the different life cycles in S. takeyai, A. takeyanus showed different life cycles in the two sites. In the Kyoto site, most individuals of A. takeyanus in the overwintering eggs of S. takeyai entered summer diapause immediately after winter diapause, showing a mostly univoltine life cycle. In Nara Park, the wasp did not enter summer diapause. Therefore, it was concluded that the aestivation of the wasp has been appended to overwintering as an adaptation to the evolution of seasonal host-plant alternation in the lace bug, which was secondarily lost by the bug in Nara. The different life cycles in the bug and the wasp significantly affected the rate of parasitism and the hatchability of S. takeyai eggs.

N2  - The wing polymorphism and egg diapause of the oriental chinch bug, Cavelerius saccharivorus, are reviewed from the viewpoint of seasonal adaptations in subtropical regions. Although the incidence of macroptery in this bug is density dependent, it is also strongly increased by seasonal factors such as long daylength and high temperature. As a result, macropters are produced most abundantly from late summer to early autumn. These macropters disperse actively to more favorable habitats such as summer-planted sugar-cane fields, where they lay diapause eggs from autumn to mid-winter. The diapause eggs of this bug, especially those laid by brachypters, tend to respond opportunistically to high temperatures above 25℃ by terminating their diapause. Diapause intensity also varies widely between and within clutches. It is concluded that wing polymorphism of adults and the large variation in diapause intensity of eggs are bet-hedging tactics which, together with the opportunism, constitute adaptations to subtropical winter seasons, where the benefit of egg diapause varies irregularly from year to year.

N2  - Dispersal dimorphism is a conspicuous adaptation in water striders (Hemiptera : Gerridae) where the flightless adult morph is easily recognized by its distinctly reduced wings. Populations may be either winged, wing dimorphic, or flightless (winged morph rare or missing). In this study, patterns of wing morphism and habitat use are integrated with reconstructed phylogenies (cladograms) for selected genera and species of Gerridae. Ancestral state of wing morphism, number of changes between morphism states, and associations between different traits are traced using the methods of phylogenetic inference. The results of the phylogenetic analyses are discussed in the light of various hypotheses on the evolution of dispersal dimorphism and other life history traits in insects. Ancestral gerrids probably occupied relatively stable, aquatic habitats (lotic or lentic) where the selective balance between wing morphs favoured the flightless morph. The ability to produce winged individuals, however, was only lost completely in species colonizing the extremely stable marine environment. When available habitats became less stable, the selective balance shifted towards the winged morph and the species became permanent dimorphic or monomorphic winged. In temperate regions, many species became seasonally dimorphic with a high frequency of short-winged adults in the direct breeding, summer generation.

N2  - Experiments were done to elucidate factors inducing and terminating prepupal diapause in the Kyoto population of Cotesia glomerata (formerly Apanteles glomeratus)(L.), whose primary host is Pieris rapae crucivora Boisduval. Diapause in this population was induced in nearly all individuals by a 20-day exposure to 10℃ during the larval stage in the host body irrespective of photoperiod, although the diapause incidence was significantly lower under 16L-8D than under 10L-14D when the cold exposure (10℃) was shorter than 18 days. The winter cold accelerates the diapause development : The mean prepupal periods at 14 and 20℃ were significantly shorter in February cocoons than in November ones irrespective of photoperiod, and in December cocoons at 20℃-16L-8D, decreased with elongation of 4℃ exposure at least up to 4 months. The seasonal synchrony between C. glomerata and P. rapae crucivora is discussed on the basis of the results obtained.

N2  - The role of trehalose in lipid mobilization during flight was examined using a trehalase inhibitor, validoxylamine A (VAA), in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. VAA induced a significant increase in hemolymph trehalose concentrations within 12h of the administration in resting locusts. A maximum level was reached 4 days after VAA injection, and relatively high levels were maintained for 16 days. The hemolymph lipid concentration was also increased after VAA injection, and a maximum level was attained in 1 day. When locusts injected with VAA or water 1 day before the experiment were tethered for 1 h, no significant difference was found in time spent flying during this period between the VAA-injected and water-injected groups, indicating that VAA did not influence flight activity. In water-injected controls, the trehalose concentration decreased and lipid concentration increased after a 1-h tethering trial. These changes suggest the occurrence of a switch-over from carbohydrate to lipid utilization during flight, as often reported by others. In VAA-injected locusts, on the other hand, both trehalose and lipid concentrations remained at high levels irrespective of the flight duration. These results suggest that there is no direct relationship between trehalose and lipid concentrations in the hemolymph, and that locusts may not monitor the hemolymph trehalose level for lipid mobilization in VAA-injected locusts.

N2  - The flight activity and flight fuels of a cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, were investigated. Flight activity was monitored at 30℃. Both sexes started leaving the containers by day 3 and virtually all individuals disappeared from the containers within a week. Hemolymph samples were collected from 3-or 4-day-old tethered adults flown for 0-6 hours to observe the changes in concentrations of trehalose, diacylglycerol (DG), hydrocarbons and cholesterol in the hemolymph. The trehalose concentration declined after a 15-min flight, whereas the DG concentration increased significantly after a 1-hour flight. This pattern suggests that this cricket uses trehalose during the initial stage of flight activity and switches the flight fuel to DG for a further extended flight, as reported for locusts by others. Both hydrocarbon and cholesterol concentrations remained rather constant over a 6-hour flight. Tethered crickets which could not fly because their wings had been glued together beforehand did not show a significant change in either trehalose or DG concentration. Low-density lipophorin (LDLp) appeared in the hemolymph after a 1-or 2-hour flight, but much less in quantity than in AKH-injected unflown crickets. It was confirmed that the adipokinetic hormone (Grb-AKH) stimulated the formation of LDLp in this species. By electrophoresis, LDLp was found to contain apoLp-III, an apo-lipoprotein known to restore the solubility of a lipid-loaded lipophorin in other species.

N2  - Pseudopimpla glabripropodeum He et Chen, 1990 was recorded from Japan for the first time and found to be an idiobiont ectoparasitoid of mature larvae of Hartigia agilis (Cephidae), a shoot borer of Rosa multiflora (Rosaceae). Up to 50% of H. agilis larvae were attacked by P. glabripropodeum from 1995 to 1997 in Okayama, Honshu, Japan. Description and figures of the final instar larva are given. Adult male and female are redescribed and figured based on Japanese materials. Host and larval cephalic structure of Pseudopimpla are discussed. Coloration differences between Chinese and Japanese specimens are referred.

N2  - Main ethological features in the cell provisioning and oviposition process (POP) of Tetragonisca angustula are as follows : 1-caste interactions are more agonistic than ritualized ; remarkable by the absence of buccal contacts ; 2-POP is exclusively batched ; 3-brood cells are successively constructed ; 4-in the preprovisioning phase workers strongly dart to the queen ; 5-the dartings clearly elicit agitation of the queen that, in turn, generates agitation in the behavior of the nurse workers ; 6-cell provisioning is synchronous ; 7-worker-born eggs laid at the inner rim of provisioned cells are eaten almost exclusively by the queen, etc. The behavioral diagnosis of T. angustula is presented together with considerations on its relationships to other taxa.

N2  - In chestnut galls formed by Dryocosmus kuriphilus, empty chambers with no emergence traces of either D. kuriphilus or parasitoids (type-N chambers) are frequently observed. A classification was made of the contents of chambers for galls collected from 13 wild chestnut trees in late November, 1988, in mid March, from mid May to late July and in late November, 1989, in order to examine the factors involved in the formation of these type-N chambers. The mean monthly proportion of type-N chambers in comparison with all types of chamber was significantly different amongst the trees between May and July. The proportions of both type-N chambers and parasitism on D. kuriphilus by parasitoids varied greatly amongst the trees, ranging from 0.4% to 40.7% and from 24.5% to 75.8%, respectively, but did not differ significantly between the sampling dates after mid June in most trees. The mean proportion of type-N chambers after mid June in each tree was positively correlated only with the mean proportion of parasitism by Torymus beneficus hibernating at the pupal stage. These data suggest that the formation of type-N chambers in this study area was due not to plant resistance, but to host feeding by T. beneficus hibernating as pupae. This also implies that addition of the type-N chamber to direct parasitism should be made in evaluation of the overall mortality of D. kuriphilus.

We found that both the soldiers and "normal" 1st-instar nymphs attacked artificially introduced insect larvae. Three alates were collected in Japan in November. Because they were secondary migrants and not sexuparae, the life cycle is probably anholocyclic in Japan.

Principal component analysis showed that Locusta individuals represented, in general, gradual change in the morphometric characters according to their distribution. Morphometric nature of populations of L. migratoria in some areas in northwestern and southwestern China were analyzed by the stepwise linear discriminant analysis, showing the presence of a wide transition zone between the areas for typical L. m. migratoria and L. m. manilensis.

N2  - In a kind of minihistory of diapause ecophysiological studies the pivotal moments are stressed : rejection of autointoxication hypothesis, discovery of the role of photoperiod and latitudinal changes of its critical threshold, conception of diapause development as physiogenesis, effect of photoperiod changes, conception of diapause syndrom, quantitative response to photoperiod and multiple pathways of diapause. In the second part, two obsolete overgeneralizations are rejected : (1) the belief that an exposure to chilling temperatures is a prerequisite for hibernation diapause completion in all cold temperate insects ; (2) The assumption that photoperiodic response is irreversibly lost by diapause completion in all insects.

N2  - To stimulate further study on seasonal adaptations in insects, two hypotheses are proposed, one accounting for latitudinal variations in diapause intensity and the other pertaining to the phenotypic plasticity of critical photoperiod for diapause induction. (1) In some species with constant voltinism, diapause intensity increases southward to cope with higher risks of untimely termination of diapause before winter. In other species with variable voltinism, it decreases southward presumably because of stronger selection for nondiapause phenotypes and positive correlations between diapause intensity and incidence. (2) Clinal variations of critical photoperiod for diapause induction may be mimicked by phenotypic responses to temperature. Such plasticity expands the latitudinal range of adaptation. In a noctuid moth, the critical photoperiod is increased by long photoperiods in the early stage of development, so that photoperiod itself may also be involved in phenotypic adaptation to climatic gradients.

N2  - A sequence of physiological mechanisms underlie the photoperiodic induction of insect diapause. Some of the mechanisms such as the action of circadian genes and the changes of bioamines with day length were recently focused for investigation, and their involvement in photoperiodism became obvious. There are many other phenomena regulated specifically by day length. Most of them are accompanied by diapause and observed after diapause onset. However, other phenomena observed before diapause onset seemed to be important for the determination of the diapause. I will focus on these phenomena using several insect species : first, the physiological events with chronological order from photoperiodic reception to diapause onset in the cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae, pointing out their importance in the diapause, and next, instances of physiological events which lead insects to diapause in the phytophagous lady beetle, Epilachna vigintioctopunctata, and the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The reserve for the survival during diapause also seemed to be important as a determining factor of diapause.

N2  - The mini-review summarizes published and unpublished results on regulation of ovarian maturation and activity of the corpora allata (CA) by photoperiodic and food signals in one model species, Pyrrhocoris apterus. The CA stimulate both pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic growth of oocytes, but a higher activity of the CA is necessary for vitellogenesis. Surgical interventions to the neuroendocrine system in vivo and in vitro revealed that a fine tuning of the CA activity is enabled by interaction of two regulatory mechanisms : (1) slow and irreversible regulation (stimulation or inhibition) associated with changes of the gland size ; (2) fast and reversible inhibition at biosynthetic steps. Regulatory factors from the pars intercerebralis of the brain are most efficiently transferred to the CA via nerves, although they may occasionally reach the CA via humoral pathways if the nerves are cut.

N2  - Photoperiodism is involved in a variety of morphological, physiological and ecological adaptations in insect life. Yet, underlying physiological mechanisms are so complex that we have only superficial understanding. Photoperiodic system consists of at least three functional units ; photoreception, photoperiodic time measurement per se and endocrine switch mechanism. If these units are separate entities, the neuronal communications between them must exist, though the possibility that the first or last two units or all may reside in the same single cell cannot be precluded. Many now believe that photoperiodic clock is closely associated with circadian oscillation, the molecular genetic mechanism of which has been rapidly disclosed recently. This article challenges the problem both by our original data from immunohistochemical investigations employing various antibodies including photoreceptive protein, neurotransmitters, neurotransmitter receptors and clock gene products and HPLC analyses on free amino acids and biogenic amines and by laying out our current knowledge on each of the above functional units based on molecular biological and neuro-endocrinological analyses. Comparison among several model systems for insect circadian/photoperiodic clocks revealed an astonishing variability both in behavior of circadian gene products such as PER and in colocalization patterns in putative hormonal agents and PER, which calls for an intensive future study in each model species.

N2  - In a drosophilid fly Chymomyza costata, larval diapause is induced by seasonal photic and thermal cues. Larvae growing under short days and/or low temperatures enter winter diapause at the final (3rd) instar. C. costata is widely distributed in the Holarctic region from 40 to 70°N. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction has a latitudinal cline. It is regulated by the combination of at least two genes which are localized on the X-chromosome and autosome(s). In the present study, the X-linked photoperiodic clock gene (cpp) was mapped by genetic linkage analysis. Genetic crosses were performed between Olekminsk (60°N, 120°E) and Tomakomai (42.5°N, 141.5°E) strains which showed clearly different critical photoperiod. Two X-linked mutant genes were used as genetic markers : a circadian clock mutant period (per) and an eye color mutant garnet (g). Male flies carrying an allele responsible for a short critical photoperiod were selected from F1 backcross progeny and their individual genotypes for per and g were scored. The linkage analysis revealed that the photoperiodic clock gene (cpp) and per are localized separately on the X-chromosome.

N2  - The mechanism of photoperiodic response in Leptinotarsa decemlineata has been regarded as a model for adult diapause. Recently, the evidence of regulatory mechanisms for adult diapause has been accumulated and the outline of adult diapause was clarified in Riptortus clavatus, an alternating model. This review summarizes the neural and endocrine mechanisms of the photoperiodic response controlling adult diapause in R. clavatus. R. clavatus has facultative diapause in adult stage. Photoperiodic regulation of diapause is a long-day type. The photoperiodic receptor is localized in the central region of the compound eyes. The endocrine effector organ responsible for reproductive diapause is the corpus allatum. In diapause adults, the brain suppresses the corpus allatum activity via the nerve. Consequently, a reduced juvenile hormone titer in the hemolymph causes suppression of reproduction. However, cuticular mechanical properties and lipid accumulation associated with diapause do not depend on the corpus allatum activity.

N2  - Circadian biological clocks are fascinating time-keeping devices that are found in all studied eukaryotic organisms and some prokaryotes as well. Our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the function of circadian clocks has developed tremendously within the past few years. Several different insect species, from both endopterygota and exopterygota subdivisions, served as important model organisms in physiological and molecular studies of circadian biological oscillators. The aim of this review is to summarize the current understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of insect circadian clocks and stress the similarities as well as the differences found among the studied insect model species.

N2  - The cold tolerance strategy of the house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum, consisted of at least two components, freezing avoidance by supercooling and chilling tolerance. The former ability varied with season and latitude. The northern population with severe winters lowered the supercooling point (SCP) in winter, but the southern population with mild winters did not. A prime factor limiting the supercooling ability of this spider was the presence of ice nucleators in the gut. The SCP depression, therefore, can be achieved at least in part by excretion or inactivation of gut ice nucleators. Chilling tolerance also showed a seasonal cycle, but the underlying mechanism seems to be different from the mechanism regulating supercooling ability. Both supercooling ability and chilling tolerance were associated with the diapause programme. The relationship between the two, however, differed geographically. The cool-temperate diapause enhanced both supercooling ability and chilling tolerance, but the subtropical diapause enhanced only chilling tolerance. This interpopulation difference in the relationship between diapause and cold hardiness provides an indication of the pathway of evolution. It would follow that the ancestral diapause of this spider evolved first with chilling tolerance, but not with an ability to lower SCP. The latter ability would have evolved secondarily as the spider expanded its distribution from subtropical to cool-temperate regions.

N2  - Variation in diapause characteristics was studied in 3 strains of the spider mite Tetrany-chus urticae Koch originating from different altitudes (0, 380 and 980m) on Mount Olympus (Northern Greece) as well as in 11 strains from different latitudes in Europe. The critical daylengths (CDLs) for diapause induction and termination were almost the same in each strain but varied according to their altitudinal and latitudinal origin. The lower the altitudinal or latitudinal origin of the strains the shorter the CDL for diapause induction and termination. In the three strains from Mount Olympus, the photoperiodic response curves for diapause termination shifted to the left when determined at progressively later times after transfer from cold storage at 4℃ to the experimental photoperiods at 19℃. This was the result of the fact that the responses to longer daylengths gradually became saturated whereas the photoperiodic maintenance of diapause by short daylengths was gradually weakened and eventually lost completely. The same has also been found for the strains originating from different latitudes in Europe. The intensity of diapause (measured as the number of days required for 50% diapause termination under LD 8 : 16 and 19℃, or the period of cold storage required for 50% diapause termination at LD 8 : 16 and 19℃) varied in relation to the altitudinal or latitudinal origin of the strains ; it increased with increasing altitude and latitude. The results show the presence of considerable variation in diapause induction and termination characteristics between strains, which is probably genetically determined and may have great adaptive significance for this wide spread species.

N2  - Thermal constants of development, lower development threshold (LDT) and sum of effective temperatures (SET), vary between species. In insects, LDT and SET are negatively correlated and this functional relationship is probably a consequence of adaptation to thermal environments. Although LDT varies adaptively with geographic latitude, the corresponding change of SET was not established. I therefore investigated the role of body size, taxonomic position and food specialization as constraints on SET (and consequently on development duration). The study was made using published results on 45 Coleoptera, 15 Diptera and 60 Lepidoptera species whose larvae are predators, feed on living plants, or eat dry plant or animal food. There was a significant positive regression of SET on biomass accumulated during the development of larva or body mass of the pupa. The residual variation of SET was tested by ANOVA. In larvae, there were significant differences between groups of species with different trophic specialization. In Diptera, larval SET was significantly shorter and pupal SET was longer than in Coleoptera or Lepidoptera.

N2  - Heteropterans occupy a wide range of habitats characterized by pronounced seasonality of environmental conditions. In the temperate zone, they use different seasonal adaptations to survive and successfully utilize resources under these sometimes severe circumstances. To review the known adaptations, we use two approaches. First (as suggested by Tauber et al., 1986), all seasonal adaptations are divided into three categories (dormancy, seasonal migration and seasonal polyphenism) with further subdivision of each category into diapause-mediated and non-diapause responses. We suggest here an alternative approach based on the four seasons of the yearly cycle when these adaptations either used by insects or at survival of which these adaptations are aimed to. In the group of winter adaptations, we discuss basic traits of winter diapause (metabolic parameters, facultative and obligatory nature, photoperiodic induction, sensitive stages, temperature dependence, geographical variation of photoperiodic response, use of host plant status and temperature as alternative cues for diapause induction, cold-hardiness etc.). The spring complex of adaptations has been less studied and includes different types of post-diapause photoperiodic sensitivity that are evidently adaptive under different circumstances. As summer and autumn adaptations, we discuss summer diapause, photoperiodic control of nymphal development and coloration of nymphs and adults, behavioral adaptations and migration. Some general considerations and directions for further research are also given.

N2  - Egg-hatching rhythms were studied in three species of katydids, Eobiana engelhardti subtropica (formerly Metrioptera hime), Gampsocleis buergeri, and Homorocoryphus jezoensis, under various photoperiodic and thermoperiodic conditions, and the time-measuring mechanisms in these species were analyzed. Light-dark or temperature cycles were effective in synchronizing the egg hatching. A single signal of light or temperature is involved in both triggering of hatching behavior and determining of hatching time. In E. engelhardti, the hatching behavior is triggered by a single signal of light-on or temperature rise, but it is not triggered in G. buergeri. The time measuring system in E. engelhardti starts by a single signal of light-off or temperature fall. In G. buergeri, the time of hatching was determined by light-off but not clearly by temperature fall. When eggs in H. jezoensis were transferred from periodic to constant conditions, hatching peaks were repeated at about 24 h intervals, suggesting the involvement of a circadian time-measuring mechanism phase-set by photoperiodic and thermoperiodic signals. In E. engelhardti and G. buergeri, however, no free-running rhythms of hatching were observed. When the phase of the photoperiod or thermoperiod was shifted to various phase angles, the hatching time in E. engelhardti became adjusted to new cycles. Moreover, no resonance effect was detected when either light or dark phase and warm or cool phase were systematically changed. The mechanism controlling the hatching time in E. engelhardti operates as an hourglass and the rate of time measuring process was accelerated by light. It seems that the comparison of hatching pattern under various conditions in katydids is effective in the evolutionary approach to the time-measuring mechanism.

N2  - Insect life cycles and their control are extremely diverse and complex. They can be studied in several ways, including the analysis of ecological correlations (according to habitat, region and species), trade-offs and modelling. Many existing studies of all of these types are available, and a number of generalizations about how life-cycle adaptations evolve can be drawn from them : similar environmental challenges can be solved in many different ways ; similar responses can evolve independently ; responses evolve in combination ; a single response may contribute to many functions ; the same response may serve different functions ; each species has a unique set of responses ; life cycles structure different resources ; expected trade-offs are not inevitable ; selection is a long-term process ; and the nature of environments is the key to understanding life cycles. These generalizations show especially the great extent of complexity, parallel evolution and overlap in the responses of different species, as well as the great importance of environmental resources and conditions in structuring the responses. Although some such generalizations ought to be self-evident, they have often been overlooked. Enumerating them helps to demonstrate that great care is necessary for planning relevant studies. In particular, the generalizations suggest that future work on insect life cycles will be most fruitful if it is done in a broader context than most previous studies : by analyzing genetic and environmental components and their interactions at the same time ; by assessing how life cycles structure the resources of time, space and energy ; by measuring natural environmental conditions and their variation in more detail and in relation to specific life cycles ; by conducting comprehensive work on individual species ; and by developing long-term multifaceted studies rather than doing further elementary experiments.

N2  - Reproductive incompatibility occurs between green and red forms of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. To determine whether the presence of Wolbachia is related to the reproductive incompatibility, males of a Wolbachia-infected green-form population (G^+) were crossed with females of either an uninfected green-form population (G^-) or a G^+ population treated with tetracycline to eliminate all Wolbachia (G^T). No reproductive incompatibility was observed in either cross. When females of a Wolbachia-free red-form population (R^-) were crossed with green-form males from the G^+, G^- or G^T population, reproductive incompatibility was observed in all crosses. Therefore, the Wolbachia of the G^+ population does not influence compatibility of the host, and incompatibility of the two forms is likely to be due to nuclear genes rather than the presence of Wolbachia.

N2  - The processes of eupyrene and apyrene spermatogenesis from the 4th larval instar to adult eclosion, the differentiating mechanism of the two types of sperm and the relationship between spermatogenesis and adult diapause in P. c-aureum were studied. It was assumed that the large cysts were destined for eupyrene sperm whereas the small ones except some spherical cysts were destined for apyrene sperm. Based on their shape, cysts were divided into three developmental stages, i.e. spherical, pyriform and elongate stages. The results showed that spermatogenesis during the larval and pupal stages proceeded in the same way between individuals reared under diapause-inducing (8L16D and 21℃) and diapause-averting (15L9D and 21℃) conditions, respectively. Although eupyrene spermatogenesis preceded apyrene spermatogenesis, the former continued even during the pupal stage when apyrene spermatogenesis was most active. This observation may indicate that there is no switch-over from eupyrene to apyrene spermatogenesis. The proportions of cysts with different sizes suggested that spherical cysts as well as pyriform and elongate cysts followed the dichotomous developmental pathways into small and large sperm. Furthermore, the primary spermatocytes showed two peaks in frequency distribution of their sizes. These results strongly suggest the possibility that differentiation into eupyrene or apyrene cysts could occur much earlier than the primary spermatocyte stage. In conclusion, differentiation of the two types of sperm is difficult to be explained by assuming the presence or absence of the apyrene-sperm-inducing-factor (ASIF) proposed by Friedlander and Benz (1981).

N2  - The sizes of terminal oocytes in females and ectadenia in males of a stink bug, Plautia corrosota stali were positively correlated with the JH-biosynthetic activity by the corpora allata (CA) in vitro. The CA size and JH-biosynthetic activity were greater in reproductively active bugs than in diapause ones. Some of the females kept under diapause-maintaining conditions for a long period, i.e. 120 days, started growing oocytes and changed body colour from brown to green. Their CA activity and CA volume varied greatly among individuals, and the variation was correlated with oocyte growth and body colour. In diapause adults, the CA activity was enhanced without conspicuous increase in CA size when the nervous connections between the brain and CA were severed. The operated bugs developed their ovaries, and their CA produced more JH in vitro than those of sham-operated or intact diapause controls. These results suggest that the JH biosynthesis by CA and the CA size are independently regulated by the central nervous system.

N2  - The temporal changes in mass of the testis, accessory gland and flight muscle were compared between short-winged (SW) and long-winged (LW) male adults of a wing-dimorphic cricket, Modicogryllus confirmatus, to investigate the presence or absence of morph-specific resource allocation or a trade-off. No significant morph-specific difference was found in mass of the testis or the reproductive accessory gland at adult emergence. However, both organs were significantly heavier in SW morphs than in LW morphs on days 5 and 10. Mean testis weight increased slightly during the first 5 days, but decreased by one-third by day 20. The accessory gland grew bigger continuously and, by day 20, became 7.6 and 6.3 fold heavier than the weight at adult emergence in SW and LW morphs, respectively. LW males from which the hindwings were artificially de-alated at adult emergence to induce flight muscle histolysis (DLW) showed a pattern similar to that of SW ones. By limiting the food ration, it was found that LW morphs allocating energy resource to development of the flight muscle had smaller testes and accessory glands than SW or DLW males at day 5. This indicates the presence of a trade-off between flight capability and reproduction in males. Administration of a juvenile hormone analog, methoprene, stimulated the development of the testis but not the accessory gland. 20-hydroxyecdysone had no influence on either reproductive organ. Weight-specific oxygen consumption was inversely correlated to body size and age, but not influenced by the presence or absence or the physiological state of the functional flight muscle.

N2  - Most of the parasitoids which emerged from the withered galls of Dryocosmus kuriphilus in spring of 1990 in Tsukuba, Japan were Torymus sinensis, an introduced parasitoid of D. kuriphilus, that was released in 1982. Fresh galls formed in the same period were dissected to examine the oviposition of T. sinensis in the field. Oviposition started on 8 April and lasted for about one month. A time lag was 13 days between the peak of female emergence and that of its oviposition. Females randomly oviposited in each larval chamber before the peak of oviposition and the oviposition became concentrated later. More than one egg were found among 31.6% of the chambers examined. Most of the eggs, 87.4%, were laid in the chamber with a live larva of D. kuriphilus, while superparasitism was observed at 7.8% of the eggs laid. As an ovipositing site, the body surface of the host was much more selected (67.5%) than the surface of the chamber wall or in the chamber wall tissue. Female adults of T. sinensis killed 11.9% of the host larvae on an average by their host-feeding. Mean survival rate of D. kuriphilus larvae was only 0.8% after the ovipositing period of T. sinensis. Adult females live estimated at least 37 days in the field.

N2  - The effects of both time elapsed and unrewarding experiences on the persistence of learned responses by Ascogaster reticulatus females were examined. The strength of a female response was measured by the distance she walked while exhibiting the characteristic antennating response along the learned cues (tea leaf extract) in a Petri dish assay. The learned response of females gradually decreased with time after conditioning (rewarding experiences), while it decreased much more quickly after unrewarding experiences. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of an additional rewarding experience (re-conditioning) on females that ceased responding to learned cues after unrewarding experiences. Females receiving the additional rewarding experience recovered their responses and they re-learned the previously learned cues efficiently. Behavioral plasticity in learning may be advantageous for A. reticulatus females to utilize the learned cues effectively and thereby to search for hosts.

N2  - Trunk trail distribution of Lasius fuliginosus has been observed in Kyoto, Japan for 8 years. Each colony began constructing its trail networks in early spring, expanded them during summer, then reduced the trails and stopped foraging outside the nest before the onset of snow. This cycle was repeated every year. Though the trail network itself was quite dynamic, some of the trails appeared to be stable whereas others were temporary. Networks never overlapped between neighboring conspecific foreign colonies, and no direct conflicts were seen between the workers. This suggests that the trail network system of L. fuliginosus is a territory system that might enable workers to avoid direct conflicts on their foraging territories.

Species of the genera Ornithoptera and Troides in the study were shown to be closely related. Species of the subgenus Ornithoptera also displayed a very close relationship, as well as species of the subgenus Schoenbergia. The genera Pachliopta and Losaria, as well as Atrophaneura and Byasa, were suggested to be closely related. On the other hand, Battus is excluded from the Troidini phylogenetically. The common ancestor of Ornithoptera and Troides was supposed to have evolved either in the region that includes Australia and New Guinea Island, or in a part of South-east Asia, and diverged into the two genera before or after the time when fragments of Gondwanaland collided against Asia.

N2  - We describe and illustrate the male internal reproductive system of Aulacoscelis sp., a species apparently related to A. melanocera Duponchel et Chevrolat, 1843. These are the first such data presented for the subfamily Aulacoscelinae, which has often been regarded as one of the most primitive groups within the family Chrysomelidae. The female spermathecal organ is additionally described and compared to that of other Chrysomelidae. The systematic position of the Aulacoscelinae is reviewed in the light of these and other morphological characters such as the hind wing venation and male external genitalia. That many of these characters are shared by both Aulacoscelinae and Orsodacninae leads us to propose that these are sister taxa allied closely to the cerambycid subfamily Lepturinae.

Immature stages of the two species are also described. These new species are very similar except for some minor differences in male and female genitalia and the morphology of the larval head and thoracic nota. However, their downstream distribution is quite different : L. akagiae inhabits larger mountain streams while L. minor has been collected in spring runs. Both species exhibit a univoltine life cycle with an early spring emergence. The males and females of both species do not show any flight activities but rather run on the stream surface.

N2  - Effects of aging and temperature on the reproductive development of unmated male adults of the West Indian sweetpotato weevil Euscepes postfasciatus were studied. Under 14L-10D and 25℃, the testes slightly increased in size only during the first 10 days after emergence, whereas the numbers of sperm in the testes-seminal vesicles complex greatly increased with age, at least between day 5 and day 60 of their adult life. Short and long types of tubular accessory glands (TAGs) and their contents greatly increased with age until day 20 and then the rate of increase reduced. In order to assess the effect of temperature on reproduction, weevils were reared at 18, 22, 26 and 30℃ for the examination of TAGs development, and at 15, 20, 25 and 30℃ for the spermiogenesis. The lower the temperature, the more the development of TAGs and the rate of spermiogenesis were reduced. It is likely that the male's reproduction may be suppressed by low temperatures during winter.

N2  - The effects of photoperiod and temperature on nymphal development were investigated to understand the seasonal life-cycle strategy of a nymph-overwintering cricket Velarifictorus parvus in Ibaraki, Japan. In an ecologically relevant range of photoperiod, this cricket showed a long-day response : nymphs grew rapidly in long photoperiods (15-16h), and slowly in short photoperiods (12-14h) due to the induction of diapause at mid instars. At least two types of response were recognized : one was an all-or-none type in which nymphs developed either with or without diapause in the same photoperiod, and the other a graded type in which the intensity of diapause varied in proportion to the length of photoperiod. The number of nymphal instars was greater in short photoperiods than in long ones. Among crickets experiencing diapause, no positive correlation was found between the duration of nymphal development and adult body size. Mid-instar nymphs in diapause resumed rapid development at any time upon transfer to a long photoperiod. However, nymphs exposed to a long photoperiod only for the first 7 days failed to enter diapause even after transfer to a short photoperiod. Crickets collected in late autumn and kept outdoors until early winter were all nymphs ranging from the 3rd to the last (7th-10th) instar. However, instar composition of overwintering populations was rather stable between years, which appears to be achieved by their complicated response to photoperiod and temperature during the nymphal stage. This species did not decrease the supercooling point for overwintering.

N2  - When male and female of Anoplophora malasiaca encountered, the male was observed to hold and mount the female, and then to bend his abdomen toward her abdominal tip. The male was observed to approach or hold the female only when he touched her with his antennae and/or tarsi. During holding and mounting, the male frequently touched the female elytra and pronotum with his palpae. Males showed similar mating attempts toward a glass dummy treated with solvent extract of female elytra. This indicates the presence of a female sex pheromone that is perceptible by direct contact. When the extract was chromatographed on silica gel, only the fraction eluted with hexane released a series of mating behavior (including abdominal bending) in males. The pheromonal activity was apparently enhanced when the hexane fraction was mixed with the 15%-ether-in-hexane and/or ether fractions. The contact sex pheromone of this beetle was therefore considered to consist of a less polar compound (s), probably hydrocarbon (s), and a more polar compound (s) that functions synergistically.

N2  - The effect of rearing density on wing-form determination in thelytokous Thrips nigropilosus was examined. Developmental period, head width, pre-oviposition period and early fecundity of each wing morph were investigated to clarify adaptive significance of the effect of rearing density on the production of brachypterae. Higher densities enhanced production of brachypterae. Mortality and developmental period from hatching to adult eclosion were generally increased with rearing density. The developmental period of the brachypterae was the longest among all wing morphs. The brachypterae had longer oviposition periods, smaller heads, and lower fecundity than other wing morphs.

N2  - The seed-insect fauna of pre-dispersal acorns and acorn seasonal fall patterns were investigated in a mixed stand of Quercus variabilis and Q. serrata in central Japan. Five coleopteran species, one hymenopteran species and six lepidopteran species were found in pre-dispersal acorns of Q. variabilis and/or Q. serrata. In Q. variabilis, Characoma ruficirra (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) was the most dominant species, followed by Poecilips cardamomi (Coleoptera : Scolytidae). On the other hand, acorns of Q. serrata were dominantly infested by a cynipid gall wasp. P. cardamomi and Cydia glandicolana (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae) were found in both Q. variabilis and Q. serrata acorns. There was an obvious difference in the falling period of insect-damaged acorns. Developing acorns absorbed by Mechoris ursulus (Coleoptera : Attelabidae) and those attacked by P. cardamomi, a cynipid wasp and C. ruficirra mainly fell before September, whereas those attacked by M. ursulus, Curculio robustus (Coleoptera : Curculionidae), Curculio sikkimensis (Coleoptera : Curculionidae) and tortricid moths and/or a blastobasid moth fell after September as sound acorns. This difference in seasonal fall of insect-damaged acorns would be closely associated with the difference in the time of attack and oviposition by seed insects.

N2  - Burying beetles bury carcasses which will become food for their young. One of the major functions of carrion burial is said to be the guarding of the resource against competitors. This hypothesis was tested. The number of burying beetles attracted was not significantly different between carcasses buried by burying beetles and carcasses not buried. This suggests that the burial of carcasses by Nicrophorus vespilloides does little to deter competing burying beetles. However, some evidence was found indicating that carcass maintenance (rolling & treatment with secretions) by burying beetles is a significant component in the prevention of carcass discovery.

N2  - Aphidoletes aphidimyza, an aphidophagous species of Cecidomyiidae, has been used in many countries as a biological control agent against aphids in greenhouses. The species had been reported previously in Japan. Recently, preliminary tests started in Japan to evaluate its effect on aphids using mass-produced cocoons imported from the Netherlands and United Kingdom. There are no clear diagnostic morphological differences at the subspecies level between Japanese and European specimens. Therefore it is necessary to study intraspecific variations at the DNA level before Japanese populations are contaminated by mating with individuals imported from foreign countries. We sequenced part of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene in twelve Japanese local populations and one commercially imported population from the Netherlands. The sequences were found to be highly variable between Japanese and European specimens.

The dry-season form of this new subspecies is similar to those of subspp. sadanobui Shirozu et Yata, 1982 from Indochina and evansi Corbet et Pendlebury, 1932 from the South Andamans, but distinguishable from them by the forewing black distal border with its inner edge not strongly angulate at vein 6, and the narrower hindwing black border with its inner edge more strongly projected along each vein. Information on the local distribution, habitat, and habits of the new subspecies is also given, especially in relation to sympatric species, E. nilgiriensis Yata, 1990.

N2  - The life cycle and diapause characteristics were compared among three katydid species to investigate the ecological function of initial diapause in katydids. Metrioptera japonica (Bolivar) inhabiting northern areas as well as alpine regions of its southern range required two or more years to complete its life cycle and showed two types of embryonic diapause : one occurs just after blastoderm formation (initial diapause) and the other shortly before hatching (final diapause). Some eggs of this species remained in initial diapause for several years. Initial diapause was terminated at 25℃ after chilling at 3℃ for six months, but the rate of termination was lower in eggs derived from higher altitudes. Metrioptera hime Furukawa and Chizuella bonneti (Bolivar) are univoltine and entered diapause only at a late embryonic stage. These univoltine species hatched over a relatively long period of time in spring but emerged as adults by summer, because they occur only at lowlands. The time of adult emergence in M. japonica at high altitudes varied greatly from year to year, and adults appeared relatively late in the season. Because eggs of this species survived a period of chilling even before reaching the initial diapause stage, initial diapause is probably not a prerequisite for overwintering. Variation in the time of oviposition or induction of initial diapause did not affect the timing of hatching that occurred two years later. It appears that in M. japonica initial diapause plays an important role in the control of the life cycle in habitats where the growing season is short and unpredictable.

N2  - The effects of different larval foods (a wild cruciferous host plant, Rorippa indica and a cultivated cabbage, Brassica oleracea var. capitata) on flight fuels and other nutrients in the adult diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, were studied. The amounts of glycerides tended to be higher in the adults grown on R. indica than in those grown on B. oleracea. The amounts of other nutrients, glycogen, total sugars and free amino acids tended to be lower in the adults grown on R. indica than in those grown on B. oleracea. The amounts of glycerides were not different between the sexes but other nutrients in the females tended to be higher than those in the males, especially when the DBM grew on R. indica. These facts suggest that larval host plants influence nutrient allocation between flight fuel and egg production in the DBM.

N2  - Food consumption, body weight gain, and total fat content were compared between long-winged (LW) and short-winged (SW) adults of a cricket Modicogryllus confirmatus to understand how different wingmorphs accumulate and use fat reserves after adult emergence. The wingmorph-specific difference in food consumption was confirmed in females : LW females consumed less food than SW females during the first 5 days of adulthood. LW females in which flight muscle histolysis was induced by artificial de-alation (removal of hindwings) at adult emergence (DLW females) consumed more food than intact LW. Unexpectedly, no such difference was obtained in males, and food consumption was much less than in females. Dry body weight was directly related to food consumption, but females were heavier than males after consuming the same amount of food. No significant wingmorph-specific difference was observed in trehalose, glycogen, triglyceride (TG) and total fat contents of the body before feeding. As they fed, LW adults accumulated more fat than SW or DLW adults in females, but fat and TG contents stayed more or less constant in males. SW adults used more TG than LW or DLW adults in both sexes during a 3-day fasting, indicating the presence of morph-specific nutrient utilization or metabolism. These results suggest the importance of information for both sexes to elucidate the physiological costs of the flight capability in wing-dimorphic insects.

N2  - Overwintering ground beetles were sampled quantitatively at twelve microhabitats along the Kizu River in Kyoto, Japan. A total of 492 individuals (156 adults and 336 larvae) belonging to 37 species of Carabidae and one species of Brachinidae were collected. The density of overwintered adults varied among the microhabitats. At the margins of running water, larvae of Harpalus spp. overwintered with high density (37.0 individuals/m^2), a finding which may be based on the seasonality of floods and food sources. The overwintering developmental stages of carabids were classified into three types : i) adult (24 species), ii) larva (7 species), and iii) adult and larva (6 species). According to previous studies on carabid life cycles in Japan, these types roughly correspond respectively to : i) spring breeders, ii) autumn breeders with short-lived adults, and iii) autumn breeders with long-lived adults.

N2  - The adaptive significance of female territorial behavior in Trissolcus plautiae, a solitary parasitoid of a pentatomid bug, was examined in relation to the reproductive strategies of the parasitoids. When two female wasps oviposited in the same host eggs, the offspring survival of the first female increased with decreasing time intervals between ovipositions of the first and second females. The offspring survival of the second female was similar to that of the first female when superparasitism took place a few hours after the first oviposition. When a conspecific female approached a host egg mass guarded by a resident female, the resident generally succeeded in evicting the intruder, and the resident stayed longer on the host egg mass. The intruder rarely succeeded in laying eggs in parasitized host eggs, although they tried to approach the host egg mass. When female wasps encountered conspecifics before or just after oviposition, they also stayed longer on the egg mass until the time when offspring survival would not be affected by subsequent parasitism. These results suggest that T. plautiae females decide how long to stay on the host egg mass after oviposition, assessing the likelihood of superparasitism by conspecifics.

N2  - The members of Megaloptera are separable into three groups : dobsonflies, fishflies and alderflies. In dobsonflies, a large gelatinous spermatophore is produced, and copulation ends shortly (within a few minutes) when attaching the spermatophore externally to the female genitalia. After separation the female eats the gelatinous mass for more than 2 h, during which time the sperm migrates into the female genital cavity. By contrast, in fishflies, there is prolonged copulation following spermatophore transfer (which lasts 2-6 h), and the spermatophore possesses no gelatinous mass. To examine the relationship between spermatophore structure and male mating behaviour of the third group, the alderflies, the mating behaviour of seven species of Sialis was observed in the laboratory. They inseminated via the externally attached spermatophore in the same way as dobsonflies and fishflies. However, the spermatophore had no gelatinous mass as in fishflies, and copulation ended shortly after spermatophore transfer (in copula for only 0.5-2 min) as in dobsonflies. The female removed the spermatophore shortly after mating, which was attached for only 7.3-12.7 min. Why do not male alderflies prevent the female from removing the spermatophore? Because the time to empty the spermatophore is very short (6.4-7.3 min when placed in insect Ringer), which time is ensured even though the male does not guard the spermatophore. Rapid evacuation of spermatophore contents may be owing to a thicker and shorter spermatophore tube in alderflies than in the other groups. Thus, three types of male post-mating behaviour are observed in megalopteran species ; (1) rapid evacuation of spermatophore contents without post-mating guarding as in alderflies, (2) behavioural protection afforded by direct contact with the mated female as in fishflies, and (3) indirect protection by feeding the mated female with a gelatinous mass as in dobsonflies. These types of mating behaviour also occur in crickets and to some extent in bushcrickets, probably as a result of evolutionary convergence among these insect groups inseminating via the externally attached spermatophore.

N2  - Life cycle of the willow leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora, was studied at Ishikari (43°N, 141°E ; Hokkaido, Japan). The field censuses of adults, egg clutches and pupae on the host-plant, Salix sachalinensis, in 1996 illustrated that P. versicolora showed bivoltine life cycle at Ishikari. The field census of adults in 1997 also illustrated the same dynamic pattern as bivoltine cycle. The overwintering-generation adults began to colonize on the host-plant trees from late May and laid egg clutches from early June. The first generation began to pupate from early July and emerged as adult from mid-July. The first-generation adults had oviposited from late July to end-August. The second generation pupated from mid-August and emerged as adult from late August. All adults disappeared from the host-plant trees by mid-September. In addition, a census on three willow species (S. sachalinensis, S. miyabeana and S. integra) was conducted in 1997. Both adults and egg clutches tended to be observed more on S. sachalinensis than on other species, though S. sachalinensis was not the most abundant willow species at Ishikari. This suggests that the bivoltine life cycle of P. versicolora is maintained on S. sachalinensis.

N2  - Sperm displacement in the turnip sawfly, Athalia rosae, was investigated. Virgin females were individually mated with a single virgin male (single-mating) or successively with two virgin males (double-mating). The number of sperm stored in the spermatheca of the females in the single-mating group was not different from that in the double-mating group. However, it decreased dramatically when the second mating was interrupted halfway through. The penis had a conical projection with many bristles along the lateral side, and a mass of sperm was observed on the projection of males in copula at the beginning of the second mating. These results indicate that the second male removes the sperm of the first male stored in the spermatheca using the projection on the penis before ejaculation.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were conducted on the host-feeding parasitoid Pimpla luctuosa to determine how needs for hosts and non-host food influence the foraging decision of whether to forage for hosts or for food. Females provided with both hosts and water lived longer than females provided with only water but shorter than females provided with honey-water and hosts, indicating that host hemolymph and carbohydrate are both needed to maximize longevity. In the wind tunnel, females and males that had fed on honey responded to honey odor while those fed on sucrose water or only water did not respond to honey odor, suggesting the effect of learning. When given a choice between vanilla odor associated with hosts and honey odor, most of starved females that had experienced these two odors preferred honey over vanilla, but many of honey-fed females preferred vanilla. The response by females given only hosts and water for 2 days was intermediate between starved and well-fed females. When given only hosts and water for 4 days, many females did not exhibit flight response to odors. These results suggest that P. luctuosa females make choices between host-foraging and food-foraging based on their continuously shifting needs for hosts and for food.

N2  - Ordinary scales, especially cover scales on the discal portion of the forewing upperside were compared in two Japanese species of Pieris, P. melete Menetries, 1857 and P. napi (L., 1758). The following four differences were found between these two species ; the first finding is in males and the second to fourth ones are in both sexes. 1) The distal portion of cover scales is curled dorsally in P. melete, while in P. napi the scales are evenly flattened throughout its length. 2) The distal margin of cover scales is more deeply incised and tips more sharply pointed in P. melete than in P. napi. 3) Number of serrations on the distal margin of cover scales is generally greater in P. melete than in P. napi, but not significantly different. 4) As to the reticular microstructure on the upper surface of cover scales, the distance between longitudinal ridges and that between cross-ribs are shorter in P. melete than in P. napi, and consequently the reticulation appears denser in P. melete than in P. napi. The curled distal margin of the cover scales in P. melete males is presumed to enhance the evaporation of scent substances from the androconia during male hover flight.

N2  - Mamestra brassicae (Linnaeus) can be regarded as a long-day insect, because a long winter diapause (WD) is induced by short daylengths while nondiapause and short summer diapause are predominant under intermediate (14.5 h) and long (>15 h) daylengths, respectively. However, LD16 : 8 (16 h light : 8 h dark) dramatically enhanced WD induction and LD12 : 12 averted WD when followed by LD14 : 10 after the egg or early larval stages. Only three cycles of LD16 : 8 in the first larval stage followed by LD14 : 10 resulted in 100% WD. In the early larval stage, a shift from LD18 : 6 to 15 : 9 as well as from LD15 : 9 to 14 : 10 gave a high incidence of WD, but that from LD16 : 8 to 15 : 9 prevented WD. Increasing shift below the critical daylength (e.g., from LD10 : 14 to 13 : 11) did not avert WD. These results could not be explained either by a response to the direction of daylength change or by a response involving stepwise processes. We hypothesize that, within a certain range of photoperiod, the critical daylength for the programming of pupal development changes with the daylength in the early developmental stages. The incidence and intensity of diapause under simulated 'natural' photoperiodic conditions suggested the significance of daylength change in the fine tuning of the seasonal life cycle.

N2  - When the onion fly, Delia antiqua, drank D_2O (10, 30 or 50%) in LD12 : 12, the phase of locomotor activity delayed toward late photophase in a dose-dependent manner. With 30% D_2O, the phase was also delayed in LD14 : 10 and 16 : 8. The free-running period (τ) with D_2O increased in a dose-dependent manner in constant darkness (DD), suggesting that the phase delay of locomotor activity in LD cycles was caused by the increase in τ. With H_2O, the phase of locomotor activity occurred progressively later with age in LD cycles. The free-running rhythm also increased with age when the fly drank 50% D_2O. In LD cycles, however, D_2O (30% or 50%) did not cause any age-dependent phase delay of locomotor activity.

N2  - The time required for oviposition and change in body colour from brown to green after a 30 day-chilling was examined in diapause adults of Plautia crossota stali Scott. When day 20 or 30 diapausing adults were exposed to low temperatures of 15℃ or 10℃, or kept at 20℃ under short day conditions (LD12 : 12h) for 30 days, then transferred to 20℃ and long day conditions (LD16 : 8 h), the pre-oviposition period after transfer was not significantly different among the three temperature regimes. When chilling was started from day 45, the pre-oviposition period in the regime exposed to 10℃ was significantly longer than that of the 15℃-regime. In the three temperature regimes with chilling starting from day 60, the lower the temperature to which bugs were exposed, the later first oviposition occurred. The later chilling was started, the faster bugs tended to turn from brown to green, and the lower the chilling temperature, the slower the change in colour. A positive correlation was detected between the pre-oviposition period and the time required for the body colour change to occur after the transfer to 20℃ and long day conditions.

N2  - When eggs of Homorocoryphus jezoensis were kept under 12L : 12D at 30, 25 or 20℃, nymphs hatched 6-10 h after light-off. Under continuous darkness (DD) or light (LL) at 25℃, hatching was not synchronized. When exposed to various photoperiods of 24 h cycle at 25℃, however, eggs mainly hatched at around light-on with photophases longer than 16 h. With photophases shorter than 12 h, eggs hatched during the darkphase, and the mean hatching time (light-off=hr0) tended to be later as the photophase was shortened. Under thermoperiodic conditions (with 12 h each of warm and cool phases) in DD or LL, eggs hatched 6-10 h after temperature fall. Under a combination of photoperiod (12L : 12D) and thermoperiod (25℃ : 20℃, each 12 h), hatching time basically depended on the photoperiod. Under the treatments with an un-naturally large phase angle between thermoperiod and photoperiod, however, their interacting effect was observed. When eggs were transferred to constant conditions from photoperiodic or thermoperiodic treatments, the hatching rhythm continued and it showed the circadian rhythm.

N2  - The timing mechanism of egg hatching was analyzed in a katydid, Eobiana engelhardti subtropica (formerly, Metrioptera hime), by exposing eggs to various non-24 h thermoperiods (25℃ : 15℃) in continuous darkness (DD) or light (LL). Eggs hatched in both warm (W) and cool (C) phases when both phases were 2 h (2W : 2C, W+C=T=4 h) in DD or LL. When W : C ratio was kept at 1 : 1 in DD, hatching concentrated within 2 h after temperature rise with T=8 or 36 h. Most hatching, however, occurred 8-12 h after temperature fall at T≧42 h. In LL, a hatching peak was observed after temperature rise at T 16 h and 4-8 h after temperature fall at T≧20 h. Therefore, the timing mechanism which determines the hatching time is most likely initiated by a temperature fall. No resonance effect was detected when either W or C was systematically changed. The mechanism controlling hatching in this species operates as an hourglass. However, the rate of hatching was affected by a circadian element, since it was significantlyc higher when T=24 h with C>8 h than when T≠24 h.

N2  - Two selection lines have been established in Plodia interpunctella for slow and fast rates of larval-pupal development at 25℃, LD16 : 8. The fast developing line (FDL) completed larval and pupal development in 32.0±1.45 days (mean±SD), and the slow developing line (SDL) in 37.06±1.34 days. The selection also affected the metabolic rate, since the FDL produced heavier adults than the SDL. Photoperiodic response curves at 20℃ and 25℃ in these lines were long-day type but the degree of retardation in development was more prominent in the SDL than in FDL under all short days and continuous light. There were three distinct categories of development : (1) fast development, (2) short-day induced slow development and (3) very slow development or diapause. The proportion of larvae showing the third category of development was not affected by selection. The extent of retardation of larval development falling in this category was however strongly affected by photoperiod and temperature conditions. High temperature such as 25℃ overrode photoperiodic effect and also decreased the proportion of larvae diapausing. The effect of selection was yet apparent at this temperature : development in the FDL was much faster than in the SDL. Such a complex response is probably adaptive for storage environment. The establishment of selection lines for fast development and slow development could be a good genetic tool to dissect a highly complex physiological system like photoperiodism controlling larval diapause.

N2  - The cell provisioning and oviposition process (POP) of the neotropical Schwarziana quadripunctata, a subterranean stingless bee, presents the following major ethological characteristics : 1-Ovipositions facultatively batched, eventual batches very small mostly with two cells, and rarely with four cells ; 2-Caste interactions complex and largely ritualized ; 3-Worker-born trophic eggs very large, perfectly integrated in the POP, laid on the collar of provisioned cells and eaten mainly by the queen ; 4-Preprovisioning and provisioning agitations localized. The ethological diagnosis of Schwarziana is given together with a preliminary comparative analysis on ethological similarities to other representatives of the Plebeia complex.

N2  - The life cycle of the camphor tree weevil, Dyscerus hylobioides (Desbrochers) was studied in japanese anise-tree, Illicium anisatum, plantations in Tosashimizu City, Kochi Prefecture, southwestern Japan. Overwintered adults appeared on host trees from April. Eggs were observed in the bark near the trunk base from May to October-November with two peaks in May-June and August-September. Numbers of pupae and adults found in logs showed a bimodal pattern with two peaks in May-July and September-November, with the first peak higher than the second. No eggs, pupae and adults were found in logs during winter and early spring. Most of the overwintering larvae were old ones. The percentage of old larvae was the lowest in June and July. Young larvae were mainly found from June to October. It is suggested that a small proportion of eggs laid early in the season (late spring) develop into adults and emerge from host trees in late autumn. However, eggs laid in the later seasons (summer-autumn) cannot develop into pupae by the end of the year of their oviposition, and as a result they overwinter during the larval stage. Pupation and adult emergence occur in the following May-July. Most newly-emerged adults did not lay eggs during the year of their emergence, and they could start to oviposit in the following year. Adults were observed on host trees until November-December. It is concluded that a two year life-cycle is common but some individuals seem to be univoltine in the warm temperate lowland of Kochi Prefecture.

N2  - Prey of the two praying mantises, Tenodera aridifolia and T. angustipennis, were investigated in a grassland around copses and that in or around paddy fields, respectively, where either species predominated in southern Osaka. Proportions of feeding individuals in younger nymphs (1st-3rd instar), older nymphs (4th-7th instar), and adults were 1.1, 2.0, and 1.8%, respectively in T. aridifolia, and 1.4, 2.2, and 2.1%, respectively in T. angustipennis. These proportions did not significantly differ in the corresponding stages between the two mantis species. The two mantises preyed on various groups of insects and spiders. The younger nymphs preyed on dipterous insects most frequently, while the proportion of dipterous prey in prey menu decreased in the course of development of the two mantis species. The prey menu in order level did not differ between the two mantises. The results suggest that the habitat segregation between the two mantises is not due to difference in prey menus. Another factors which may cause their habitat segregation were discussed.

N2  - A survey of sugarcane fields was conducted in the southern part of Okinawa Honto in 1997, to learn the rate of range expansion of the sugarcane cicada, Mogannia minuta, which was restricted only within Chinen Village until 1973. The distribution range expanded only 5 km toward Sashiki Town and 0.3 km toward Tamagusuku Village during 24 years, showing notably slow rate of expansion. The extraordinarily high density of cicadas has been maintained during this period in the centre of the distribution range. Escape of the epidemic cicada population from predators is considered to be an important factor affecting the slow expansion and stability of the epidemic population.

N2  - Parasitism by Xenos moutoni was studied in four Vespa species collected with bait (fruit juice and liquor) traps in forests in Miyazaki Prefecture, southern Japan. Stylopized hornets were seen between May and mid October. The overall rate of stylopized female hornets (queens or workers) was largest in V. analis insularis (11.2%), followed by V. mandarinia japonica (4.3), V. ducalis pulchra (4.2), and V. simillima xanthoptera (1.7). Male hornets were also stylopized in V. analis (6.4%) and V. ducalis (1.7). The number of parasites per host varied from one to five, though 60% of hosts were singly parasitized. Male parasites did not occur before late July, but they outnumbered females in September and early October. Female parasites were almost always found between the 5th and 6th gastral tergites of hosts, and most males between the 4th and 5th or the 3rd and 4th. Cephalothorax widths of female parasites were positively correlated with head widths of female hosts in V. analis, V. mandarinia and V. ducalis. Multiple parasitism on single females decreased the average size of female parasites in V. analis. The percentage of stylopized individuals among overwintered queens was estimated at 15% in V. analis and 4% in V. mandarinia and V. ducalis. Stylopized workers that had overwintered were found : they accounted for 24 to 44% of overwintered stylopized females. Workers were most frequently stylopized in August in V. mandarinia and in September in V. analis and V. ducalis.

N2  - In an experiment to explore the effect of the amount of flesh food on the number, larval duration, and body size of first brood workers in a paper wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, founding queens were forced to rear their first brood workers under three levels of flesh food availability in cages. The number of first brood workers increased and their larval duration decreased from low to high food levels. On the other hand, the body size of first brood workers was the largest under a surplus food supply, but only slightly larger than the field value, and it did not differ between middle and low food levels. Queens seem to rear their first brood workers in a manner to make many adults as early as possible according to the food availability under constraint that workers have a minimum effective body size and maximum larval developmental speed.

N2  - Interaction and niche differentiation among burying beetles (Nicrophorus : Silphidae) were investigated in the forest of Hokkaido, northern Japan. Collecting by pitfall traps and field experiments of carcass utilization were conducted from May to September in 1990 and 1995. In the study site, there occur five Nicrophorus species, of which three were dominant : N. maculifrons, N. quadripunctatus and N. vespilloides. Based on collections from pitfall traps, habitat preference, seasonal activity and diurnal activity were compared among the three dominant Nicrophorus species. The activity of N. maculifrons peaked in late spring, being earlier than those of other two species. The active season of N. quadripunctatus and N. vespilloides overlapped, though the diurnal activities and habitat preference were somewhat different. In the experiments of placing mouse and rat carcasses in the field, N. maculifrons utilized carcasses early in the season, corresponding to its seasonal activity as measured by pitfall trapping. N. quadripunctatus and N. vespilloides, on the other hand, both utilized carcasses in mid-summer, suggesting competitive interaction between them. Furthermore the size of carcasses preferred by each Nicrophorus species was examined. The size of occupied carcasses was not different among three dominant species.

N2  - Hodotermopsis (Isoptera : Termopsidae) is one of the most primitive genera of termites. The species belonging to this genus have been thought to be relicts, and to have entered Japan before the formation of the Tokara Tectonic Strait in the Pliocene, and left as relict species in Japan and the southern part of China. We sequenced 928bp of mitochondrial genes (COI, COII and tRNA of leusine) of Hodetermopsis populations of Japan, Taiwan Island (Is.) and China. The inferred molecular phylogeny showed that each of populations in Japan and Taiwan Is. formed a monophyletic group. The topology among Japanese clades did not clarify the phylogenetic relationships among different islands because of the shortage of phylogenetically informative sites, suggesting the rapid and recent extension of Japanese populations. In light of these findings, the estimated timing of divergence events together with the current paleogeographical scenario indicate that Japanese Hodotermopsis extended its distribution through landbridges connecting China through Taiwan Is. to Kyushu Is. of Japan 0.4-0.2 million years ago in the Pleistocene.

N2  - A total of 260 insect species has been introduced into Japan since 1868 (Meiji-era). The number of exotic species becoming established is increasing exponentially and more than half of them were Coleoptera and Hemiptera. On an average, 3 species per year have been invading Japan so far. They were accounted for 73, 22 and 5 per cent as pest, non-pest and beneficial insects, respectively. The southern islands encompass only 1.2% of Japanese land, but 40% of exotic species are first established in these islands. As a result of the secondary range extension between islands and mainland, 60% of exotic insects have become established in the southern islands. Both greenhouse and outdoor pests extended their distribution range exponentially with the same rate, enabling us to predict the extent to which an invasive insect or mite will occur in the future. It was shown that homogenization in insect and mite fauna is taking place worldwide in greenhouses.

N2  - Adult beetles of Atrachya menetriesi started oviposition in a shorter time in the field than under constant laboratory conditions when the heat sums above the threshold (11℃) were about the same. This might be due to the differential effects of constant and fluctuating temperatures on sexual maturation in the female. To confirm this possibility, females were exposed to thermoperiods of 28 or 32℃ (12h)/16 or 20℃ (12h) superimposed on a photoperiod of LD 16 : 8h. Both the pre-mating and pre-oviposition periods were shortened by thermoperiods compared with those predicted for constant temperatures equal to the mean temperatures of the thermoperiods. Such an effect was particularly conspicuous in thermoperiods with a 16℃ cryophase. Acceleration of sexual maturation was discernible even in an extreme thermoperiod of 32℃(2h)/16℃ (22h) but became less obvious with increasing duration of the thermophase up to 10h. No sharply defined critical thermophase or cryophase was observed for this response, so that the involvement of a clock system might be excluded. These results suggest that experiments using constant temperatures may not be satisfactory to establish a model for predicting seasonal life cycles in insects. Females of a strain selected for producing nondiapause eggs at 25℃ required much less heat for starting oviposition than those of a wild strain producing only diapause eggs.

N2  - Validoxylamine A (VAA) is a highly specific trehalase inhibitor and its administration to insects results in accumulation of trehalose in their body. In the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, this compound suppressed oocyte development when injected to reproductively active females. Most individuals injected with VAA stopped oocyte development completely after producing a few egg-pods, whereas water-injected controls continued to lay eggs until they died. VAA did not influence longevity of females unless a large dose (100μg/animal) was given. JH biosynthetic activity in vitro was 18.8 pmol/h/pair on average for corpora allata (CA) taken from water-injected females, whereas it was only 1.01 pmol/h for those removed from VAA-injected females, in spite of the fact that the culture medium used contained a large amount of glucose, the metabolic fuel normally produced from trehalose by the action of trehalase. It seems that the reduced activity by CA from VAA-injected females was brought about by reduced amounts of precursors, because an addition of a precursor, farnesol, to the medium restored the function of such CA. Topical application of a JH analog, methoprene, stimulated oocyte growth in reproductively inactive females injected with water, but failed to do so in those injected with VAA. However, in vitro incubation of fat body with labelled methionine indicated that JHA stimulated vitellogenenin synthesis both in VAA-injected and water-injected females, though protein synthesis appeared to be less active in the former. SDS-PAGE profiles of hemolymph samples also confirmed the presence of various proteins including vitellogenins in the two groups of locusts. These results apparently suggest that VAA suppressed oocyte development in this species through affecting JH biosynthesis by CA, vitellogenin synthesis by the fat body, and uptake of yolk material by the ovary.

N2  - The bee fly, Villa myrmeleonostena parasitize the antlion larva, Myrmeleon bore living in seaside dune. To obtain the ecological information on the parasitism by V. myrmeleonostena, we examined rates of parasitism in the antlion larvae collected monthly from April to October in 1991. Adult bee flies emerged from cocoons, which we obtained by rearing the antlion larvae. The emergence times of parasitoids and hosts were similar. The parasitism rate based on pooled data was the highest in the third instar larvae (9.7%) and the lowest in the first instar larvae (2.5%). More than 15% of third instar larvae collected in April and May were parasitized by V. myrmeleonostena. Newly hatched first instar larvae of M. bore were found after August, and some of them were also parasitized. From these results, it was inferred that V. myrmeleonostena oviposit during the period from late summer to mid-autumn. They probably do not touch an antlion larva to lay an egg on it but might drop an egg while hovering around the pit of antlion.

N2  - Of five cerataphidines that form galls on Styrax suberifolia in Taiwan, "Astegopteryx" jamuritsu is the only species whose life cycle and taxonomic position remain unclear. We found three mature galls of the species in southeastern Taiwan. The galls were very hard and of single-cavity type. Examination of the morphology of 1st-instar nymphs deposited by alates revealed that the life cycle is host-alternating, and that the species belongs to the genus Cerataphis. The aphids were found to harbor slender yeast-like symbionts, like other genuine Cerataphis species. It has been hypothesized that the species produces soldiers that readily fall off their gall when disturbed. We found numerous 2nd-instar soldiers in the galls, but they did not readily fall off the galls. Keys to the five species based on the 2nd-instar soldier and the mature gall are given.

N2  - Workers and queens of Bombus (Diversobombus) ussurensis and workers and probably queens of B. (D.) diversus produce rhythmical sounds when they feed larvae. Feeding bees produced sounds throughout from opening of the larval wax covering to insertion of their mouth parts into the hole in the wax covering. Sounds were produced when the bees crossed and minutely vibrated the apical parts of the folded wings. The spectrum of the feeding sounds differed between the species in the average time of burst sounds and the presence of the interruption between successive burst sounds. By contrast, species of other 4 Japanese subgenera were not detected to produce sound during feeding. At present the biological meaning of the feeding sound is unknown, but 3 conceivable assumptions were discussed.

N2  - Prey foraging efficiency by the foundresses of Polistes chinensis was estimated at 57.6% throughout pre-emergence phase, being considerably higher than those reported previously. The value was especially very high during the old-larval and pupal periods when the foundresses hunted large numbers of sawfly larvae, suggesting that such high values were achieved by frequent foraging for this food item.

N2  - To evaluate diversity of ant fauna in natural forests of Yanbaru, the northern part of Okinawa Honto, 30-minute samplings of individuals or nests were carried out. Through four series of collectings, 40 ant species were found, of which 32 were stenochoric (east Asian) species, including 14 species possibly endemic to the Ryukyus. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the ratios of stenochoric species and endemic species between with- and without-undergrowth plots, ratio of stenochoric species tended to be higher in without-undergrowth plots than in with-undergrowth plots (8/12). Simpson diversity (1-D) and equitability index (J′), calculated using frequency of encounters with ants in 30 minutes, were 0.87±0.06 and 0.93±0.04 in with-undergrowth forests and 0.84±0.09 and 0.87±0.10 in without-undergrowth forests. Although values for with-undergrowth forests were significantly larger than those for without-undergrowth forests in the second series of collectings, there was no significant difference in other two series and combined data for three series. But J′ for combined data from with-undergrowth forests was larger than that from without-undergrowth forests at a nearly significant level (Mann-Whitney U-test ; P=0.068). Both of 1-D and J′ based on the number of nests found in 30-minute samplings in intact natural forests inside U. S. Marine Corps Northern Training Area were 0.90, far higher than values for deciduous forests in Hokkaido and somewhat higher than natural evergreen forests in Iriomote Island, Okinawa.

N2  - We found a predatory thrips, Franklinothrips vespiformis (Crawford) in Okinawa, Japan in 1996 and this is the first record of occurrence of this predator in Japan. The behavior and morphology of this species were observed in the laboratory. Both larvae and adults attacked larvae and adults of Thrips palmi, two spider mite species, larvae of the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii and larvae of the serpentine leafminer Liriomyza trifolii. Adults collected in the field were all female and their offspring also all female. These facts suggest that this thrips propagates by female parthenogenesis. This thrips has four pre-imaginal instars : larva I, larva II, pupa I and pupa II. Adults deposited eggs singly into plant tissue by the ovipositor. Mature larvae secreted silk from the posterior end of the body and made cocoons in the space formed by two joining veins of the underside of the cucumber leaf. Morphological features of each stage as well as keys to the larval and pupal instars were described.

N2  - Sensilla on the female maxillary and labial palpi of five species of the genus Damaster were investigated with scanning electron microscopy. A total of 6 types of sensilla were observed in the apical semi-membranous area of both palpi : peg-like sensilla basiconica, cone-like sensilla basiconica types I and II, multiporous sensilla types 1 and 2, and sensilla campaniformia. No difference in the distribution pattern of sensilla between the maxillary and labial palpi were found. Based on the external morphology, each type of basiconic sensilla could be subdivided into 3, 7 or 2 subtypes, respectively. While the multiporous and campaniform sensilla were common in all the species examined, interspecific distributional variation in the subtypes of those sensilla basiconica were noticed. In addition to these results, comparative morphology of the apical segments of both palpi is discussed.

N2  - The compound eye of Nicagus japonicus Nagel, a lucanid species which is thought to be diurnally active and primitive, has been examined by light and electron microscopy and compared with that of other scarabaeoid beetles. The compound eye lacks a canthus but the anteocular margin of the head possesses a small process in front of the eye. The compound eye is composed of approx. 650 ommatidia of the eucone scotopic type. The crystalline cone is relatively small and tapered and its distal tip never contacts the cornea. Four large Semper cell nuclei occupy the interposed space of 4μm. Although the rhabdom is made up of the seven rhabdomeres of the seven retinula cells per ommatidium other than the basal cell, no distal rhabdomere is formed. However, one of the rhabdomeres is formed by longer, thicker and straighter microvilli of lesser electron density than the other rhabdomeres. The rhabdom occupation ratio, based on transverse sections of the retinula cells, is approx. 24%. Collectively the anatomical features of the Nicagus japonicus compound eye suggest that greater similarity exists with trogid species than with scarabaeid or lucanid species.

N2  - The apicoventral setae on hindtarsomere V of the Pompilidae were investigated with stereomicroscopy and SEM. Character states of the setae were roughly divided into two categories : long and setiform (state 0, plesiomorphic) and broad, flattened, bladelike (state 1, apomorphic). The ultrastructure of several types of apicoventral setae was described and illustrated. In females, state 0 was found only in Irenangelus and Ceropales (Ceropalinae), with the exception of Ceropales pacifica and C. rugata. State 1 was observed in all other groups of Pompilidae examined. Based on state 1 setae, all subfamilies except Ceropalinae were associated into a monophyletic group. The Ceropalinae was treated as the functional outgroup within the Pompilidae. Most of the characteristics of Ceropalinae were regarded as plesiomorphic, except for three features which were discussed in relation to a cleptoparasitic mode of life.

N2  - Diapause responses of two geographically different populations of an egg parasitoid Telenomus euproctidis Wilcox (Hymenoptera : Scelionidae) are compared using two host species. The Ibaraki (IB) strain of the parasitoid is phoretic on female adults of the tea tussock moth Euproctis pseudoconspersa Strand in the temperate region, and the Okinawa (OK) strain on Euproctis taiwana (Shiraki) in the subtropical region. When wasps of the two strains parasitized on non-diapause hosts of E. taiwana or E. pseudoconspersa, all or most of their offspring emerged as adults without entering diapause under either short-day (LD12 : 12) or long-day (LD16 : 8) conditions. However, when diapause eggs of E. pseudoconspersa were used as hosts, all of the IB offspring and more than three-quarters of the OK offspring entered diapause. Therefore, the kind of host egg and the host physiological state affect diapause determination in this parasitoid. The intensity of diapause in the parasitoid, as represented by the length of the egg stage, was significantly higher under short-day conditions than under long-day conditions. After chilling at 5℃ for 30 or 120 days, both wasp strains terminated diapause and emerged almost synchronously as adults upon transfer to 20℃ irrespective of the photoperiod. These facts suggest that the two geographic strains of this parasitoid can enter diapause and tolerate cold, though the OK strain without diapause hosts probably has no chance to enter diapause in Okinawa. Egg masses of E. pseudoconspersa collected in January, 1996, contained only first instar larvae of T. euproctidis, indicating that this parasitoid enters diapause as a first instar larva.

N2  - Diapause termination was studied in Japanese and Finnish strains of Chymomyza costata which enters larval diapause in autumn. Laboratory experiments suggested that low temperatures (-5 to 3℃) terminated diapause and a temperature of 0℃ was the most effective. A period of low-temperature exposure required to terminate diapause was 2-3 months. Continuous illumination (LL) did not terminate diapause when applied without cold-treatment, but was more effective to terminate diapause than a short daylength (11 h light : 13 h dark) when applied after cold treatment. Under outdoor conditions, diapause of this species ended by mid winter. Japanese and Finnish strains had similar diapause-terminating processes except for the response to continuous illumination after cold treatment. No difference was observed in cold tolerance between these two strains.

N2  - Effects of (E)-phytol of five lepidopteran species in prey-locationg behavior of a predatory stink bug, Eocanthecona furcellata, were examined. The lepidopterans as test prey insects were larvae of the pellucid zygaenid, Pryeria sinica, a giant silkworm, Samia cynthia ricini, an armyworm, Pseudaletia separata, the cabbage armyworm, Mamestra brassicae and the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. Nymphs of E. furcellata attacked intact larvae of all these insects. Larvae of P. sinica, S. cynthia ricini, P. separata and M. brassicae contained (E)-phytol which had been identified from Spodoptera litura larvae as a proboscis-protruding inducer of this bug. Larval extracts of P. sinica, S. cynthia ricini, P. separata and M. brassicae elicited the proboscis-protruding behavior in the bugs, and this response depended directly on the (E)-phytol content, whereas those of E. kuehniella grown on wheat flour were not effective. Nymphs of E. furcellata preferred larval extracts of P. sinica, S. cynthia ricini, P. separata and M. brassicae containing (E)-phytol to those of S. litura fed with bean sprouts lacking (E)-phytol in glass rod bioassay. Although larval extract of E. kuehniella alone was not effective, a mixture of larval extract of E. kuehniella and (E)-phytol was active in the preference response. These results indicate that (E)-phytol in larvae of lepidopterans serve as a key chemical associated with prey for this generalist predator. However, nymphs of E. furcellata preferred larval extracts of P. sinica, S. cynthia ricini, P. separata and M. brassicae to synthetic (E)-phytol alone. Therefore, some unknown chemical factors besides (E)-phytol also appear to be used by this predator to choose its prey.

N2  - The annual life cycle and sociality of Lasioglossum mutilum were studied in a greenhouse. The results proved that L. mutilum is bivoltine and basically solitary. The oviposition period of the overwintered and first generations commenced from late May to late June, and mid July to late August, respectively. The next overwintering generation appeared after early September. Among the total of 13 nests, one each of semisocial and eusocial colonies was found. These findings are the first authentic records of sociality in the subgenus Lasioglossum. In the semisocial colony, the larger female with developed ovarioles behaved as queen-like, while the smaller one with less developed ovarioles was worker-like.

N2  - Community patterns of early spring moths in four secondary forests of Kyoto were studied by molasses trapping with special reference to the vegetation. A total of 1086 individuals belonging to 27 species of Hadeninae, Cuculliinae (Noctuidae), and Thyatiridae were caught in 1993-1995. Orthosia spp., Agrochola evelina, and thyatirids were abundant in woodland with predominant deciduous Quercus trees, while Rhynchaglaea spp. were abundant in woodland dominated by evergreen oaks. The effectiveness of the molasses traps increased with rising air temperature, but declined after April. To survey early spring moths using molasses traps, the season and air temperature should be checked.

N2  - Aquarius paludum amamiensis is an only subspecies of A. paludum and occurs in Ryukyu and Amami-Oshima islands. The wing length of brachypter of A. p. amamiensis is much shorter than that of A. paludum. Determination of the wing morphs was affected by genetic components and photoperiod ; a long day photoperiod of 15.5L and 8.5D induced macropters and a short day of 10L-14D induced brachypters. The photoperiodic response of this subtropical subspecies in the wing morph determination was opposite to that of A. paludum which occurs in the temperate zone. The average nymphal period of A. p. amamiensis was 33.5 days at 25℃ and much longer than 24.3 days that was documented on A. paludum. The fecundity of brachypter for the first 20 oviposition days is about twice as many as that of macropter, and the difference between the two morphs in A. p. amamiensis is greater than that of A. paludum that has been reported. Some macropterous females of A. p. amamiensis retained their flight muscles without histolysing even after 35 imaginal days, during which they had laid 150 eggs/female or even more. Differentiation into summer migrants and winter non-migrants in A. p. amamiensis seems to be beneficial as the subspecies has been isolated in the small subtropical islands. The differentiation may fit preferentially to the seasonal change of habitat stability ; not stable in dry and hot summer and stable in wet and moderate winter.

Mandible length frequency distributions over a period of days showed three distinct peaks, indicating that A. yanonensis and C. fulvus possess three larval instars. Sickle-shaped mandibles were observed for C. fulvus first instar larvae but were lacking for A. yanonensis.

N2  - Interspecific morphological variation in 17 sympatric stingless bee species and sugar concentration of nectar loads of six species were studied in Sarawak. Canonical discriminant analysis based on seven morphological characters showed that Trigona erythrogastra and T. thoracica had the longest tongues (glossa length (GL)&ge;2.5 mm), and that T. nitidiventris and T. itama had longer tongues (2.5>GL&ge;1.5 mm). These four species had tubular glossae. These results agree that T. itama and T. erythrogastra visited deep flowers. Among 13 short-tongued species that used shallow flowers, there are two understory-foraging species, T. melina and T. melanocephala. Difference in micro-climatic conditions between canopy and understory may affect sugar concentration of available floral nectar through evaporation. Though T. melina and T. melanocephala had tubular glossae which may be suitable to dilute nectar, sugar concentration of their nectar loads brought to their colonies was not lower than canopy-foraging species.

N2  - Plebeia (Plebeia) julianii shares four ethological features, which are absent in any other so far observed stingless bees, with four consubgeners (P. droryana, emerina, poecilochroa, remota) : 1-Queen locomotion very quick and abrupt. 2-Before food provisioning by workers, the queen violently running around the comb. 3-Workers laying eggs mainly on the comb long before the start of food provisioning. 4-Cell inspection by the queen before ovipositions mostly omitted. Meanwhile, P. julianii differs from other observed consubgeners in : (1) cells semicombed, not typically combed, (2) queen's wing beatings virtually absent, and (3) batch size very small, only 1-4 cells. The last feature is noteworthy since it results in a POP structure somewhat similar to that of Melipona, though three basic features common to other consubgeners, synchronous cell construction, obligatory batch formation and synchronous food provisioning in cells, are still vestigially retained. Ethological diagnosis common to five consubgeners is given together with a tentative comparison with other taxa.

N2  - Cylindrocaulus patalis (Lewis), 1883, is the sole passalid species in Japan, and its compound eye was examined by light and electron microscopy as part of an ongoing comparative study of the fine structure of the compound eyes of the superfamily Scarabaeoidea. The compound eye is small and partially divided by a canthus into narrow dorsal and wide ventral parts. The Semper cell, which number 4-6 in each facet, does not form a distinct cone ; the eye is, thus, of the acone type. The ommatidium, which is thicker distally and tapers off more proximally, is composed of 7-9 retinula cells. The rhabdom lies in the centre of thicker, distal region of the retinula cell bundle and the organization of its microvilli is markedly irregular. Primary pigment cells amount to four or five in number contrary to the usual figure of two. These features of the eye are thought to be somewhat unusual in view of what is known from other scarabaeid beetles to date.

N2  - The timing mechanism for hatching in Metrioptera hime was analyzed by exposing eggs to various non-24 h light-dark cycles. When the light (L) : dark (D) ratio was 1 : 1, the distribution of hatching eggs in relation to LD cycles was dependent on the cycle length. At 2 h-light : 2 h-dark (2L : 2D), eggs hatched in both L and D phases. In LD cycles ranging from 4L : 4D to 72L : 72D, hatching was concentrated within 2 h after light-on regardless of temperature. When the length of D exceeded 22 h, hatching peaked also 14 h after light-off. Therefore, the time measuring initiated by light-off as well as light-on determined the hatching time. No resonance effect was detected when either L or D was systematically prolonged, i.e. no free-running rhythm of hatching was observed. These time measuring systems damping are thought to be an hourglass type. At 20℃, the hatching rate was high only in a limited range of photoperiods around 12L : 12D, while it sharply decreased as either the length of L or D exceeded 48 h. At 15℃, the hatching rate was high regardless of photoperiodic conditions compared with that at 20℃.

N2  - To elucidate the diapause pattern of Lepisma saccharina Linnaeus, strains collected in Hirosaki were kept under controlled conditions of photoperiod and temperature. The interval between moults was uniformly short in the first two instars, but tended to increase in the later instars and showed a very large variation owing to the occurrence of diapause in some individuals but not in others. When reared at 25℃, this insect started oviposition in the 9th or 10th instar but thereafter continued to grow and moult. Some individuals survived 2.5 years or more and moulted more than 30 times. The incidence of diapause as defined by the instar duration of longer than 50 days was affected by temperature, photoperiod and age. The duration of diapause was highly variable among individuals, lasting more than 180 days at 25℃ in extreme cases. Diapause may occur in any larval and adult instar but not in the first two instars, and may be repeated in separate or consecutive instars. Some individuals underwent 8-9 diapause instars in 600-800 days. At 20℃, diapause occurred in the younger (3rd and 4th) instars at a higher frequency, and a photoperiodic response of the long-day type was manifested more clearly, than at 25℃. A high temperature of 28℃ prevented diapause at least in the larval stage under both short (12h) and long (16h) photoperiods.

N2  - During copulation, the male small white, Pieris rapae, fills a single spermatophore in the bursa copulatrix of the female. Artificial interruption of copulation showed that the male filled first white gel after which the spermatophore was structured. No sperm were found in the gel. Both eupyrene sperm bundles and free apyrene sperm were ejaculated into the structured spermatophore immediately before the completion of copulation. A male transferred about 11, 000 eupyrene sperm, whereas about 46, 000 apyrene sperm were found in a complete spermatophore just after copulation. The sperm density in the spermatophore also indicated that the velocity of transferring both eupyrene and apyrene sperm increased torward the end of copulation. The significance of timing in sperm ejaculation is discussed from a view point of sperm competition.

N2  - Galls of two tropical aphid species, Astegopteryx styracophila and A. setigera, were collected from Styrax benzoin in northern Sumatra to investigate the life cycles, the gall and colony structure and the behavior of their soldiers. Through transfer experiments it was found that A. styracophila migrates to gingers and possibly also to palms and A. setigera to bamboos. The name A. muiri is a junior synonym of the valid name A. styracophila, and A. setigera is a junior synonym of A. pallida. Soldiers of either species that had been induced to appear on the gall surface soon retreated into subgalls through ostioles. The apical wall of each subgall of A. styracophila was extremely thickened to form a "cork stopper" with narrow tunnels. This structure has probably evolved in association with their "entrance-guarding and rushing-out" tactics.

N2  - Bombus ignitus fed the larvae by progressive depositing semi-viscous liquid food on thoraco-ventral surface of larval body. Feeding was mostly performed by the younger workers. All larvae were fed the same food, irrespective of castes and males. Daily food consumption in two colonies (96-I-1, 95-I-2) was 1.3±1.2, 1.8±1.9 g of pollen and 8.3±6.6, 12.5±10.5 ml of honey solution, respectively, being larger in the colony produced more reproductives (95-I-2). Feeding behavior of adults slightly varied as they made feeding orifice on the larval cells. The queen larvae were fed for a longer duration than that of worker larvae ; duration of feeding orifice kept open was 7.4 days for queen larvae while 5.4 days for worker larvae. That longer possessing of feeding orifice may have a role in caste differentiation along with other factors.

N2  - Three species of the genus Colophina produce sterile soldiers in addition to normal first-instar nymphs, while C. clematicola has been reported to produce monomorphic, defensive first instars. This study revealed that in the first instars of C. clematicola there are three morphs, which consist of minor and major morphs and a soldier-like morph. Minor and major nymphs seem to develop into apterous and alate adults, respectively. Soldier-like nymphs are basically sterile and not morphologically specialized compared with soldiers of other Colophina species. It is supposed that the soldier-like nymphs have a function of low-intensity defense, such as the crushing of predator eggs.

N2  - Species compositions of fig-wasps were investigated in 14 figs (Ficus) distributed in Japan. A total of 38 species (Agaonidae : 36 spp. ; Ormyridae : 1 sp. ; Eurytomidae : 1 sp.) have been recognized during this survey. All fig-wasps were associated with only a single species of fig, suggesting extreme host specificity. All fig species have their own pollinators (Agaoninae), while there are considerable differences on the species richness of non-pollinating fig-wasps among fig species. Eight out of 9 species of wasps belonging to Epichrysomallinae or Otitesellinae were obtained from 3 species of monoecious figs and all but one dioecious fig did not have any wasps from these subfamilies. These facts agree with previous observations which lead to the recent hypothesis that dioecious figs evolved under the selective pressure of non-pollinating fig-wasps. However, the hypothesis should be confirmed with further studies about the ecology of non-pollinating fig-wasps. Factors which may affect differences in fig-wasp compositions between Japan and other Asian regions are also discussed.

N2  - DNA sequence data were used to examine relationships between the two sibling species Tetranychus pueraricola Ehara et Gotoh and Tetranychus urticae Koch. The second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The ITS2 sequences of these two species displayed a high degree of identity (98.3%) comparable to the nucleotide divergence observed in other pairs of closely related species. These data confirm the species status of T. pueraricola and are in agreement with previous results based on morphological analyses and crossing experiments. Furthermore, restriction-site analysis of the ITS2 region was performed in order to detect species-specific diagnostic restriction sites. Thus, the efficiency of molecular markers as a tool for determining the taxonomic status in spider mites was shown.
