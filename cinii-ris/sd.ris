N2  - Osteological characters of the percophid fish, Percophis brasiliensis Quoy and Gaimard, 1825, the sole member of the subfamily Percophinae, are described in detail. Fifteen apomorphic characters are recognized in this species through morphological comparison with the Percoidei. Of them, the following five characters are determined to be autapomorphic for this species and its subfamily among the Percophidae: urohyal greatly depressed, complex in shape; first pharyngobranchial reduced and completely ossified; Baudelot's ligament branched distally; five supraneurals or ray-less proximal-middle pterygiophores present; and body cavity extending far posteriorly. Percophis brasiliensis is considered to be closely related to the percophid subfamily Bembropinae, because they share three apomorphic characters (presence of a lower backwardly directed opercular spine crossing the subopercle, absence of a tooth plate on the second epibranchial, and absence of supernumerary rays on the ventral portion of the first anal proximal-middle pterygiophore). Although the monophyly of the Percophidae is unconfirmed, because of the lack of plausible synapomorphies, the family is provisionally defined here by the following five apomorphic characters: exoccipital condyles separated in the midline; parasphenoid and pterosphenoid connected; anteroventral portion of second anal proximal pterygiophore with a soft ray; uroneural single; and fewer than 15 branched caudal fin rays present.

N2  - The taxonomic characters of the marbled flathead, Platycephalus marmoratus Stead, 1908, are described and evaluated. In addition to the marbled body and dark brown to black caudal fin, the following combination of characters separates it from the other 14 species of the genus Platycephalus: 13 second dorsal and anal fin rays; 63-70 scales in the lateral line, with all pored scales lacking spines; snout and interorbit naked; no strong canine teeth on the jaws, palatines, and vomer; interopercular flap absent; and skinny sensory tubes on the suborbitals and preopercle partially covering the cheek region. It has been confirmed that the type series of the species was composed of the holotype and one paratype, although the paratype is presumably no longer extant.

N2  - The Japanese spiny lobster, Panulirus japonicus (von Siebold, 1824), spends an extended period as planktonic phyllosoma larvae in offshore epipelagic regions. The larvae have been morphologically confused with those of related species, called here the "longipes" group to include P. longipes (A. Milne Edwards, 1868), P. femoristriga von Martens, 1872, and P. brunneiflagellum Sekiguchi and George, 2005, in the seas off southern Japan. Partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA (tDNA-Val to middle part of 16S rDNA) show species-specific variations characterized by large interspecific differences and only very minor intraspecific ones. Based on these observations, for identification purposes we developed a PCR-RFLP test using five restriction endonucleases (BspH I, EcoR V, Hae III, Hap II, and Mbo I). We could thereby identify six species and one subspecies of Panulirus lobsters from 93 field-collected phyllosoma larvae sampled during four surveys in the seas off southern Japan in 1997 and 1998 [P. japonicus, P. longipes bispinosus Borradaile, 1899, P. brunneiflagellum, P. penicillatus (Olivier, 1791), P. versi-color (Latreille, 1804), and Justitia longimanus (H. Milne Edwards, 1837)]. We also discuss the taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Panulirus; the recently described species, P. brunneiflagellum, is placed as a sister species of P. femoristriga in spite of the former's morphological affinities with P. japonicus.

N2  - Pagurixus nanus, a new species of pagurid hermit crab, is described from shallow coral reefs of Ishigaki Island, Yaeyama Islands, the Ryukyus. Most of the specimens were collected by using traps designed for sampling the fauna associated with coral rubble. The new species belongs to the P. anceps species group due to the lack of two ventral rows of setae on the ultimate segment of the antennular peduncle, but it appears unique in having one or two small, subproximal spines on the dorsal surfaces of the carpi of the second pereopods. Morphological characteristics suggest that P. nanus is close to P. anceps (Forest, 1954) and P. patiae Komai, 2006.

N2  - A species of freshwater oligochaete, Propappus volki Michaelsen, 1916, is newly recorded from sand and gravel bottoms of several unpolluted streams in Honshu, Japan. The present material agrees well with the previous descriptions of this species except that the spermathecal ampulla is shorter and the proboscis is more elomgate than those described earlier. This is the first record of the family Propappidae Coates, 1986 (New Japanese name: Ko-himemimizu-ka) and the genus Propappus Michaelsen, 1905 (New Japanese name: Ko-himemimizu-zoku) in Japan. It provides evidence that the oligochaete fauna in Japan is more closely related to the Holarctic than to the Sino-Indian zoogeographical region. Propappus volki can be regarded as a good bio-indicator for unpolluted water.

N2  - A single specimen of the rare cottid fish, Artediellus aporosus Soldatov, 1921, was collected from the Sea of Okhotsk off Esashi, Kitami, Hokkaido, Japan. The species is characterized by having a soft body covered with loose skin, nasal bones concealed under the skin with no or rudimentary spines, and no sensory pores on top of the head. The identification of the present specimen has been confirmed by a comparison with the type series of the species. Although this species has been reported from the Sea of Okhotsk and the northern Sea of Japan, the present specimen represents the first record of it from Japanese waters. Differences between A. aporosus and the close relative A. miacanthus Gilbert and Burke, 1912 are discussed.

Lamellibrachia juni sp. nov. differs from congeneric species in having flexible and thin-walled tubes, up to three pairs of lamellar sheaths, and similarly sized cuticular plaques on the vestimentum and trunk. Oasisia fujikurai sp. nov. differs from its sole congener in having eight pairs of branchial lamellae instead of up to 20. Oasisia and Ridgeia are shown likely to constitute a monophylum, but are retained as separate genera for now. The relationships between this clade and the genera Tevnia and Riftia remain unresolved. Within the monophyletic genus Lamellibrachia, L. juni sp. nov. is closest to L. sp. L7 from the Manus Basin.

N2  - Lake Kurilskoe (77.05km^2, maximum depth 316m; 104m above sea level) is an oligotrophic caldera lake on the southern Kamchatka Peninsula, Russian Far East. The littoral zone is devoid of macrovegetation. During a hydrobiological study in 1994-1998, 43 taxa of oligochaetes were found, 26 of them identified to the species level. The littoral zone was inhabited mostly by the Enchytraeidae, Lumbricillus pagenstecheri (Ratzel, 1869), L. arenarius (Michaelsen, 1889), Mesenchytraeus kuril Healy and Timm, 2000, Marionina charlottensis Coates, 1980, and M. klaskisharum Coates, 1983. Propappus arhynchotus Sokolskaya, 1972 and Haplotaxis gordioides (Hartmann, 1821) were also sometimes abundant. Naidinae included a large form of Nais communis Piguet, 1906, together with N. variabilis Piguet, 1906, N. pardalis Piguet, 1906, and Pristina aequiseta Bourne, 1891. Tubificidae s.s. and Lumbriculidae preferred the deeper littoral and sublittoral areas of the lake. The profundal zone was inhabited by Embolocephalus kurenkovi (Sokolskaya, 1961), Limnodrilus profundicola (Verrill, 1871), Tasserkidrilus americanus (Brinkhurst and Cook, 1966), and Styloscolex opisthothecus Sokolskaya, 1969, all in great abundance. Many oligochaete species widely distributed in nearby regions were not found in this lake.

The first, Angiostoma onychodactyla Bursey and Goldberg, 2000 (Rhabditoidea: Angiostomatidae), is redefined as having an elliptical oral aperture without lips; double lateral alae; and male caudal papillae comprising nine pairs of pedunculate papillae, a single sessile papilla anterior to the anus, and two minute projections on the posterior anal lip. A new genus, Shunyanema, is established for Parapharyngodon japonicus Bursey and Goldberg, 1999 (Oxyuroidea: Pharyngodonidae). The new genus is characterized by the didelphic amphidelphic genital system, the vulva situated in the middle region of the body, and the anteriorly directed vagina in females; the absence of a V-shaped sclerotized structure supporting the genital cone in males; and the lack of an operculum and filaments in the eggs. Shunyanema japonicum comb. nov. is also redescribed and illustrated in detail.

N2  - The Pacific collections by the MUSORSTOM campaigns of the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, Prais, over the last 20 years have included a number of Tanaidacea from waters of the New Caledonia region. The species described herein as Mekon solidomala, from 440 and 700m depth, represents a new tanaid genus and species of the subfamily Langitanainae of the family Tanaidae. While displaying the ventrally fused pleonites four and five and the four-segmented antennule characteristic of the subfamily, it is distinct from the two previously known genera in having a non-flagelliform, four-segmented uropod, massive mandibles, and a large, subspherical carapace, the posterodorsal part of which overlaps the first and most of the second pereonite. One tanaid paratype bore a copepod parasite representing a new genus and species of the family Nicothoidae, Arhizorhina mekonicola. This new genus appears most closely related to Rhizorhina in its extreme reduction of body segmentation and tagmosis, and in the total loss of limbs; however, it lacks the branching rootlet system that is diagnostic for Rhizorhina, and the stalk is configured differently

N2  - In the present paper the diversity of the Costa Rican water mite fauna is analysed and compared with those of other regions. About 20000 water mites in 74 genera and 21 families were collected at more than 500 sample sites in various regions and different ecotones throughout Costa Rica (Central America). Numerous types of running- and standing-water habitats as well as springs were sampled. The frequency- and dominance-structure of the Costa Rican water mite fauna is discussed. The α- and the γ-diversities of the water mites of different regions, habitats, and elevations are compared. Different scales of diversity are distinguished. Water mite diversity decreased with elevation. The habitats with the highest α-diversity were streams (19 genera) and brooks (18 genera). Similar levels of diversity were found in the northwestern (dry forest), southwestern (rain forest), and northeastern (rain forest) regions of Costa Rica. Greater diversity of water mites was found in pristine forest regions than in open pasture areas, with as many as 19 genera found at a particular sample site. The α- and γ-diversities of the Costa Rican water mite fauna are consequently within the same range as those of other regions of Central America, North America, and Europe. The diversity in terms of total species number is about twice as high in tropical regions as in temperate regions.

N2  - Peristedion picturatum McCulloch, 1926 (family Peristediidae) was distinguished from P. liorhynchus (Gunther, 1872) by a single character, the presence of two bony plates between the anus and first anal ray (vs. three in P. liorhynchus). Our examination of the holotype of P. liorhynchus revealed that it also actually has just two bony plates there, not three. Based on a comparison of the holotype and other material of P. picturatum with the holotype of P. liorhynchus, we conclude that P. picturatum is a junior synonym of P. liorhynchus.

N2  - Prior to this study, two species of ophiuroid had been described from hydrothermal vent sites, and another from methane cold seeps, all from the Atlantic Ocean. Although ophiuroids have occasionally been reported from vents in the Pacific Ocean as well, none has been described before. This study presents two new species, Spinophiura jolliveti gen. et sp. nov., family Ophiuridae, and Ophiolamina eprae gen. et sp. nov., family Ophiacanthidae, which are most likely endemic to reducing environments in the East Pacific. We also include detailed descriptions of the post-metamorphic development of these species. Spinophiura jolliveti is characterized by up to five rather long, semi-erect arm spines and a relatively small oral shield. Its postlarva is unusual in lacking a buccal scale and in that the tooth forms later in development than in all other species the postlarvae of which have been examined. The most characteristic features of O. eprae are the attitude of the three proximal laminar mouth papillae, standing almost vertically on the oral plate, and the presence of two oval, scale-like, distal papillae. Additional migrant (non-vent-endemic) species found at Pacific vent sites are tabularized, but not identified below genus level due to the poor taxonomic state of the Pacific ophiuroid fauna. Biogeographic and ecological issues are discussed.

N2  - The phylogeny of Indo-Australian Glyphodes (15 species), Talanga (three species), Agrioglypta (four species), and two outgroup species, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner, 1825 and Metallarcha aureodiscalis (Hampson, 1918), was inferred from nucleotide sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI (686bp) and COII (687bp) genes and the nuclear EF-1α (973bp) gene. While the third codon positions in COI and EF-1α were not saturated with substitutions, those in COII were saturated when sequences were compared between genera. MP analyses based on pooled data of COI, COII, and EF-1α resulted in two MP trees. The strict consensus tree showed that Glyphodes, Talanga, and Agrioglypta were all not monophyletic. Another analysis based on pooled data of all molecular and morphological data resulted in a single tree, in which monophyly of the genus Glyphodes was barely supported (bootstrap value <50%). Glyphodes species were divided into the same three clades as in an earlier published, morphology-based tree, one of these clades (the so-called Group 3) being supported by a bootstrap value of 100%. In all analyses the genus Agrioglypta was shown to be paraphyletic, since A. eurytusalis (Walker, 1859) fell within the genus Talanga.

N2  - Three new species of dicyemid mesozoan are described from Octopus kagoshimensis Ortmann, 1888 collected off Irino in Tosa Bay, sourthern Shikoku, Japan. Dicyema tosaense sp. nov. is a small species that reaches about 800μm in length. The vermiform stages are characterized by 16-18 peripheral cells, a conical calotte, and an axial cell that extends to the base of the metapolar cells. Infusoriform embryos consist of 37 cells; two nuclei are present in each urn cell and the refringent bodies are solid. Dicyema irinoense sp. nov. is a species of medium size that reaches about 1300μm in length. The vermiform stages are characterized by 22 peripheral cells, a discshaped calotte, and an axial cell that extends to the base of the propolar cells. Infusoriform embryos consist of 37 cells; a single nucleus is present in each urn cell and the refringent bodies are solid. Dicyema sphaerocephalum sp. nov. is a species of medium size and reaches about 1000μm in length. The vermiform stages are characterized by 18-20 peripheral cells, a rounded calotte, and an axial cell that extends to the base of the propolar cells. Infusoriform embryos consist of 37 cells; two nuclei are present in each urn cell and the refringent bodies are solid. This is the first report of dicyemids in the octopus O. kagoshimensis.

N2  - A new harpacticoid copepod, Amphiascus kawamurai sp. nov., is described from a tank for nori (laver) cultivation on the shore of Ariake Bay, Japan. This species belongs to the pacificus-group of Amphiascus and is most closely related to A. parvus Sars, 1906, which is briefly redescribed based on Sars' original material. The two species are distinguishable by spinules on the genital double-somite and by leg 5 of the female. Specimens previously described as A. parvus from the Red Sea and Argentina are shown to be not identical to Sars' A. parvus. The new species is the second member of the genus from Japan.

N2  - To resolve the controversial taxonomic status of two closely-related lanternfishes, Diaphus perspicillatus (Ogilby, 1898) and D.gigas Gilbert, 1913, mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene sequences of representative individuals were obtained, and specifically-diagnostic restriction sites investigated. In the 5'-half nucleotide sequences of the cyt b gene (594 bp), a relatively high level of nucleotide substitution between the species (8.2-8.7%), together with very low intraspecific variation (<0.86%), was observed, which clearly indicates the two morphs to be specifically distinct. Previous hypotheses regarding gigantism of D.gigas and suspicions regarding the synonymy of the two species are rejected. The nucleotide sequences and practical restriction enzyme assay indicate that any one of four restriction endonucleases (Fok I, Hae III, Nla IV, and Rsa I) can unambiguously discriminate between the two species. Based on specimens identified by molecular analysis, eye diameter and gill raker count were found to be good diagnostic morphological characters.

The geographically isolated Tamagusuku (=southern) population tends to have a more laterally-directed curvature of the anterolateral margins of the carapace and relatively shorter fourth ambulatory legs. However, these differences are not very significant and the diagnostic male first gonopod shows no differences. Therefore, all the populations on Okinawa Island are here regarded as conspecific. Habitats and morphological adaptations of the species are also discussed.

N2  - Recently rediscovered in the Hokkaido University collection, the holotype and single paratype of Lycenchelys brevimaxillaris Toyoshima, 1985 were found to differ from the original description of the species in the following characters: posision of posterior end of upper jaw and numbers of anal fin rays, gill rakers on lower gill arch, suborbital, mandibular, and preoperculer pores, and vomerine and palatine teeth. Because no significant differences were found in the counts, proportions, and other characters (e.g., interneural space insertion of first dorsal fin pterygiophore), including body color, between these type specimens and L. melanostomias Toyoshima, 1983, the recently demonstrated synonymy of the two names is confirmed. The holotype and paratype of L. brevimaxillaris have been registered in the collections of Hokkaido University, Hakodate (HUMZ), and the National Science Museum, Tokyo (NSMT), respectively.

N2  - A species of freshwater sculpin, Japanese name "Kibire-kajika", inhabits some rivers of the Korean Peninsula. Although this species has been recorded under the name Cottus poecilopus Heckel, 1840 or the incorrect subsequent spelling C. poecilopterus, it is shown by comparison with the type specimens to differ from both subspecies of C. poecilopus (C.p. poecilopus Heckel, 1840 and C.p. volki Taranetz, 1933). Moreover, it is distinguished from all other members of the genus Cottus by the following combination of characters: lacking palatine teeth, pectoral fin rays not branched even in adults, lateral line complete, terminal pores of mandibular sensory canals opening separately on either side of symphysis, body almost naked, back and sides lacking dark vermiculations, pelvic fin with bands or white roundish marks bordered with a blackish line, innermost ray of pelvic fin longer than 60% of length of longest ray, second dorsal fin rays numbering 18-21, anal fin rays 14-17, pectoral fin rays 12-13, and vertebral number 34-36. We describe this species here as a new species, Cottus koreanus, on the basis of 28 specimens collected from several rivers in Korea.

N2  - Three similar species of water mite in the subgenus Hygrobates (genus Hygrobates) are reported from middle Honshu, Japan. These include two recently described lacustrine species, Hygrobates (Hygrobates) biwaensis Tuzovskij, 2003 and H. (H.) rarus Tuzovskij, 2003, which are known only from Lake Biwa, and one new fluvial species, H. (H.) capillus sp. nov. The new species is distinguished from the other two by the truncate P-2 ventral projection; the female genital plates being longer than the genital opening and extending to the post-genital sclerite; the anterior border of the flat male genital plate; and the larger body size (408-603μm). Two or three setae are confirmed to be present on the female pre-genital sclerites in the three species reported herein; this character state has never so far been recorded in any member of this subgenus.

N2  - A new boring sponge, Cliona reticulata sp. nov., is described from coral reefs of the Ryukyu Islands, southwestern Japan. This species differs from closely related taxa, such as C. aprica Pang, 1973, C. caribbaea Carter, 1882, C. orientalis Thiele, 1900, and C. tenuis Zea and Weil, 2003, primarily in its apparent inability to undergo papillary fusion and thus form incrustations on top of the excavated substratum, the lack of symbiotic dinophycaeans (zooxanthellae), and the unusually large size of the pits caused by cellular etching. A new type of thin, long and wavy spiraster found in the holotype is another distinctive character. The morphology of the substratum excavated by the sponge is also considered to be of diagnostic value. This is the second species of the genus Cliona reported from the Ryukyu Islands.

N2  - A new species of dicyemid mesozoan, Dicyema koshidai sp. nov., is described from Shiroika, Sepioteuthis lessoniana Lesson, 1830, collected off Uozu in Toyama Bay and off Mihonoseki in the Sea of Japan. The dicyemid is a large species that reaches a length of about 5000μm. The vermiform stages are characterized as having 32-40 peripheral cells, a conical calotte, and an axial cell that extends to the middle of the metapolar cells. Infusoriform embryos consist of 37 cells; two nuclei are present in each urn cell and the refringent bodies are solid. The dicyemids live in folds of the renal appendages of the cephalopod host. This is the second dicyemid species to be described from S. lessoniana. Additional details of the first species, D. orientale Nouvel and Nakao, 1938, are described. The dicyemid fauna in S. lessoniana is discussed.

N2  - It is shown that the genus name proposed for a flatworm, Ichthyophaga Syromiatnikova, 1949, is not preoccupied by the name frequently used for a genus of fishing eagles, Ichthyophaga Lesson, 1843, since usage of the latter in modern ornithological publications is actually based on a subsequent misspelling or an unjustified emendation of the original generic name Icthyophaga Lesson, 1843. Despite this one-letter difference, a replacement name for the flatworm genus is necessary due to the prevailing usage in ornithology of the generic name spelled as Ichthyophaga. As replacement name the generic name Piscinquilinus nomen novum is proposed.

N2  - The Aphroditoidea collected during two joint expeditions of the Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg, Frankfurt, Germany, and the Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, conducted in autumn of 1990 and spring of 1992 to Hainan Island, South China Sea, are presented herein. Altogether 386 specimens of Aphroditoidea (Annelida, Polychaeta) belonging to 35 species were identified. Families represented are the Acoetidae Kinberg, 1856 (1 species), Aphroditidae Kinberg, 1856 (2 species), Polynoidae Kinberg, 1856 (27 species), and Sigalionidae Kinberg, 1856 (4 species). Identification keys to the representatives of the latter two families are given. Of the 35 species, six, including one genus, are new to science: Russellhanleya striata gen. nov. et sp. nov., Harmothoe liaoi sp. nov., Harmothoe sinensis sp. nov., Lepidonopsis collinifer sp. nov., Subadyte micropapillata sp. nov., and Verrucapelma conifera sp. nov. Two poorly known species are redescribed: Paralentia annamita (Fauvel, 1934) and Lepidonotus hainanicus Uschakov, 1982, the latter having been originally described as L. dentatus hainanicus, but raised to species level herein. Eleven of the 35 species (more than 30%) represent new records for Hainan Island, with four of them being new to the South China Sea in general.

Although the genus Paraphiloconcha is closely related to Philoconcha, it can be differentiated from the latter by the presence of large lateral processes on the metasomites, a three-segmented maxilliped, and relatively more developed leg setation. In consideration of the morphology and development of mollusk-associated lichomolgid genera, Philoblenna and Briarella, both of which have been assigned to the family Philoblennidae until now, are transferred to the Lichomolgidae.

N2  - From Japan, 11 species of freshwater Nematomorpha have been described to date, but there are very few photographic documentations of any of them. This investigation describes specimens from the Lake Biwa Museum (Shiga Prefecture, Japan) and supplies the first SEM pictures and additional data for the species Chordodes fukuii Inoue, 1951, Japanese specimens of C. japonensis Inoue, 1952, and Paragordionus kawamurai Yamaguti, 1943. Two specimens likely belong to the genus Gordionus, which has not been reported from Japan before, but they could not be determined to the species level. Several specimens belonging to the genus Gordius could not be assigned to a certain species. This is due to general problems with the status of several Gordius species arising from the scarcity of taxonomically relevant characters.

Bango polyonyxgen. et sp. nov., tentatively placed in the Callipallenidae, is unique in having a compound main claw on all legs, as well as setose tubercles on the first and second coxae and the femur; the ovigerous leg of the female is of nine articles; the chelae are atrophied; and the palps are mere buds. Anoplodactylus amoybius sp. nov., of the Phoxichilidiidae, is a sibling species to A. erectus Cole, 1904 from the Indo-Pacific, from which it differs by the placement of the cement gland tube on the femur of all legs and the presence of a dorsodistal tubercle on the first coxae of the last three pairs of legs.

The nominal taxon Myophora peronii Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830, with the type locality Timor and previously considered a nomen dubium, is revised and proposed as a senior synonym of Sarcophaga tibialis Macquart, 1851, syn.n. Prevailing usage is maintained through reversed priority: Myophora peronii qualifies as a nomen oblitum, while Sarcophaga tibialis is shown to qualify as a nomen protectum. The delimitation of several Sarcophaga subgenera, Johnstonimyia Lopes, 1959, Sarcorohdendorfia Baranov, 1938, Seniorwhitea Rohdendorf, 1937, and Lioproctia Enderlein, 1928, is briefly discussed and three species are transferred from S. (Johnstonimyia) to S. (Sarcorohdendorfia): S. (Sarcorohdendorfia) gorokaensis Sugiyama, Shinonaga and Kano, 1988; S. (Sarcorohdendorfia) hugoi Pape, 1996; and S. (Sarcorohdendorfia) vanuatu Pape, 1991. The apparently convergent evolution of golden abdominal coloration in several species of Sarcophaga on Timor is discussed.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships of the superfamily Scorpaenoidea are reconstructed cladistically, based on specimens belonging to 18 families, 59 genera, and 86 species, by using osteological and myological characters recognized in 111 transformation series. The following relationships are inferred: (1) the former Scorpaenoidei is paraphyletic; (2) the family Sebastidae is not monophyletic, most of the genera included having initially branched off other ingroup taxa; (3) the family Setarchidae and Trachyscorpia have a sister relationship, being nested within the paraphyletic Scorpaenidae; and (4) the family Neosebastidae is the sister group of the former Platycephaloidei. In conclusion, the Scorpaenoidea is reclassified into 20 families, accepting several redefined taxa, such as the Sebastidae, Sebastolobidae, and Scorpaenidae.

They all belong to the subfamily Candoninae, and these findings bring the number of genera of Candoninae to 24. Meridiescandona is characterized by decorated valves, a 6-segmented antennula, and full development of furcal elements. Deminutiocandona stands apart from other candonine genera by having a 5-segmented antennula, a reduced anterior furcal claw, and 4+2 rows of spines on the Zenker's organ. The morphologies of the new genera are discussed and compared with those of the other known genera of this subfamily.

N2  - The present study focuses on spicule number, length, and positioning in larvae of two confamilial species of demosponge, Halichondria coerulea Bergquist, 1967 and Hymeniacidon heliophila (Parker, 1910). The anatomy and spiculation of newly emergent larvae were examined. On hatching, larvae of Halichondria coerulea are approximately one-half as long as larvae of Hymeniacidon heliophila. The spicules of adults and larvae of Halichondria coerulea are oxeas whereas those of Hymeniacidon heliophila adults and larvae are styles. Oxeas and styles are straight or slightly curved, and needle-shaped. In both species, spicules in larvae are significantly shorter (in mean length) than spicules of adults. This observation parallels previous reports on other species of demosponge. Mean spicule number per larva was significantly different between the two species, but the respective mean spicule lengths were indistinguishable ; some overall constraints may dictate spicule size independently of larval size. In contrast, within-species comparisons of adult spicule length versus larval length, larval spicule number versus larval length, and larval spicule number versus spicule length yielded no pairwise correlations. These data indicate that broad plasticity exists in spiculation patterns of newly hatched larvae in both species. Finally, the spicular mass of Hymeniacidon heliophila is asymmetrically positioned in the posterior region of the larva whereas the spicules of Halichondria coerulea are situated in the central region. This difference in the distribution of spicules may affect the swimming properties of the larvae of the two species differently and, possibly, also determine their positioning in the water column. It is proposed that the architecture of the flagellated epithelium governs the exclusion of spicules from the posterior region of Halichondria coerulea but is not similarly restricting in Hymeniacidon heliophila.

While closest to the type species of the genus, H. hanstroemi Lang, 1956, it is distinguished from the two known species of the genus in having a slender, seta-bearing tubercle on the basis of the cheliped, no large tooth on the cutting edge of the chela dactylus, no ventral spiniform apophyses on the pereonites, and in having the carpus of the mature male cheliped longer than wide. The new species is from deeper waters and from a finer substratum than are the other two species.

N2  - The complete larval development, under laboratory conditions, of the pontoniine shrimp Periclimenes brevicarpalis (Shenkel, 1902) is described. Nine zoeal stages and one decapodid stage were identified before the moult to the first juvenile stage, and detailed descriptions are given for each stage. As a result of detailed morphological comparisons with congeners, the larvae of Periclimenes species are separated into two groups according to morphological criteria.

N2  - The group of species allied to Pediobius alcaeus (Walker, 1839) [considered as the genus Epipleurotropis by Girault (1917)] of the genus Pediobius is reviewed. The group includes P. alcaeus, P. termerus (Walker, 1839), P. coxalis Boucek, 1965, P. fastigatus Kamijo, 1983, and a new species, P. ikedai sp. n., described from Japan (Hokkaido). Eupleurotropis Girault, 1917 (considered as a synonym of Pediobius) is synonymized with Proacrias Ihering, 1914, based on peculiarities of the propodeal structure, and the type species of the former genus is transferred to the latter genus [Pr. testaceipes (Crawford, 1914), comb. n.]. The status of the alcaeus species group in the genus Pediobius is discussed. Many new geographic records are presented, including new data on distribution of the discussed species in the Kuril Islands.

N2  - The genus Sunagocia is established as a replacement name for the platycephalid fish genus Eurycephalus Imamura, 1996, which is preoccupied by the cerambycid beetle genus Eurycephalus Gray in Cuvier and Griffith, 1832. The genus currently contains three valid species : S. arenicola (Schultz, 1966), comb, nov., S. carbunculus (Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1833), comb, nov., and S. otaitensis (Cuvier in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1829), comb. nov. It is confirmed that Cuvier satisfied the nomenclatural requirements for availability of this last species, although several investigators have attributed the name to Parkinson, who made the unpublished drawing of S. otaitensis used in its original description and named the species. Two measurements, of head length and especially interorbital width, are helpful in distinguishing S. carbunculus, S. arenicola, and S. otaitensis from each other.

The postlarvae were characterized by elongated dorsal- and pelvic-fin rays, and had 22 orange bands and many yellowish lines on the translucent body and anal fin, respectively. This is the first description of postlarvae of Ateleopus japonicus. Color photographs are included. The likelihood of two transport routes, from the southwestern Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, are discussed.

Milne Edwards, 1837), and of N. spinatus Osawa and Fujita, 2001, are described and illustrated on the basis of laboratory-reared materials. The two morphs of N. maculatus do not show any significant morphological differences in their zoeas, but N. spinatus can be distinguished from N. maculatus throughout the zoeal phase by the number of short setae on the dorsal surface of the abdominal somites. Zoeas of Neopetrolisthes resemble those of Petrolisthes and fit in Osawa's Group 4. Although a bifid lateral spine on the telson is seen in the first zoea of Neopetrolisthes species, as well as some species of Petrolisthes Group 4, Neopetrolisthes is distinguished from the latter group by the setation of the third endopodal segment of the second maxilliped throughout the zoeal phase and that of the third endopodal segment of the first maxilliped in the first zoea. These differences support the generic status of Neopetrolisthes.

N2  - The infraorbitals of representatives of all Lake Tanganyikan cichlid genera were examined in order to establish a basic morphological data base. About half of the genera examined displayed infraorbitals of type A, the most plesiomorphic arrangement among African cichlids. The remaining taxa were divided among seven types of infraorbital pattern. Types B and C were found in all examined members of the tribes Ectodini and Trematocarini, respectively, and thus appear to be synapomorphies supporting each tribe's monophyly. Type D was found in all of the species of Lamprologini examined except Neolamprologus toae (Poll, 1949), which has the type E condition as an autapomorphy, and Variabilichromis moorii (Boulenger, 1898), which appears to have retained the primitive type A, indicating that this species is better placed in a basal position in the tribe. The phylogenetic implications of types F, G, and H remain unresolved.

This represents the first reliable record of the species from Japan. It is concluded that Percis pleurostigma Sauvage, 1891, which had been considered conspecific with P. xanthozona, is a junior synonym of Parapercis punctulata (Cuvier in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1829). We concur with synonymizing Parapercis dorsonebulosa Martin and Montalban, 1935 with P. xanthozona ; this synonymy has been overlooked since 1951.

One species was identified as N. spinirostris (Berlese, 1910) and the other two are described here as new to science. Neopodocinum halimunensis sp. nov. is distinguishable from congeners by an expanded anal shield with two pairs of preanal setae in both sexes. Neopodocinum subjaspersi sp. nov. differs from the related species N. jaspersi (Oudemans, 1900) in the pectination of some dorsal and opisthogastric setae.

The male of the candonid P. inujimensis is figured for the first time and described. This is only the second record of this species. Additionally, this report of Ishizakiella supralittoralis is the first of the species and genus from the Inland Sea of Japan ; I. supralittoralis is widespread around Japan and its distribution considerably overlaps that of I. miurensis (Hanai, 1957). Previously, both species of Ishizakiella were presumed to have similar habitat requirements, but the distribution of I. supralittoralis and its coexisting species suggests that it has different habitat requirements than I. miurensis does.

N2  - A new family, Podosphaerasteridae, is proposed for the valvatid asteroid genus Podosphaeraster, with a new species of the genus from southern Japan, western North Pacific. Podosphaeraster differs from the fossil genus Sphaeraster and other valvatid families by the overall body form and the skeletal structure. The new Japanese species, P. toyoshiomaruae sp. nov., differs from the previously known species of Podosphaeraster principally in number and size of granules on the abactinal and actinal plates, number of adambulacral spines, retention of perforations in terminal plates, and ratio of horizontal diameter to vertical diameter. Podosphaeraster toyoshiomaruae was collected together with abundant sponges and probably lives closely associated with sponge. This is the first record of the genus Podosphaeraster from Japanese waters.

N2  - For many years it had been assumed that the oligochaete collection of Professor Hideji Yamaguchi had been destroyed by a large earthquake in Hokkaido, Japan, in 1968, but the majority of the collection was rediscovered recently. The branchiobdellidan portion of the slide collection has been examined, the specimens identified as far as possible, and the materials deposited in the museum of the Division of Biological Science, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Japan. All of the species described by Yamaguchi between 1932 and 1940 have been identified, and their collection sites plotted. In addition, specimens were found of species not described until much later, Holtodrilus truncatus (Liang, 1963), Branchiobdella macroperistomium Liu and Zhang, 1983, and B. monodonta Liu and Zhang, 1983. To place the information obtained in this re-examination in context, the literature on East Asian branchiobdellidans is reviewed in detail.

N2  - Genetic differences between two color morphotypes of Sebastes scythropus (Jordan and Snyder, 1900) were estimated from partial sequences of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA tRNA genes and control region. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and incorporating sequences from the congeners S. inermis Cuvier, 1829, S. joyneri Gunther, 1878, S. owstoni (Jordan and Thompson, 1914), and S. thompsoni (Jordan and Hubbs, 1925), as well as Sebastiscus marmoratus (Cuvier, 1829) (outgroup). Individuals of each color morphotype of S. scythropus were reciprocally monophyletic, with bootstrap values of 100%. The mean sequence difference between the two morphotypes was 10.1%, which was comparable to, or even larger than, the interspecific differences among the other four Sebastes species (5.9-10.8%). Sympatric occurrence of the two morphotypes with such a high degree of genetic differentiation indicates that they are reproductively isolated and stand as distinct species.

N2  - Mitochondrial 16S rRNA sequences were compared between two color-types (type-A and type-B) of the labrid fish Choerodon robustus (Gunther, 1862) collected from the Pacific coast of Japan and the Ryukyu Islands. The two types differ in coloration of the opercle lower margin and caudal fin. Two type-A specimens each had a unique haplotype, whereas only two haplotypes were found among nine type-B specimens. The amount of mean pairwise sequence divergence within each of the two color-types was very small (0.16% in type-A, 0.035% in type-B), much less than that between the two color-types (4.3%). Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods, with a haplotype of Choerodon azurio (Jordan and Snyder, 1901) as an outgroup, showed that the haplotypes of each color-type were reciprocally monophyletic with 100% bootstrap values. The sequence differences between the two color-types ranged from 4.2% to 4.6%, such being comparable to those between C. azurio and each of the two color-types (5.3-5.7%). These results indicate that the two color-types of C. robustus represent two distinct species.

Within Paraulopus, the two new species are most similar to P. nigripinnis (Gunther, 1878) in having a supraocular ridge, 4.5-5.5 transverse scale rows above the lateral line, and a large body size. Paraulopus okamurai, P. novaeseelandiae, and P. nigripinnis differ from one another in the following characters : caudal-fin coloration (black with a transverse white band on the upper lobe and a white tip on the lower lobe in P. okamurai ; white with a black posterior margin on the upper lobe and a short, dark, oblique band on the lower lobe in P. novaeseelandiae ; white with a black posterior margin on both lobes in P. nigripinnis), counts of pectoral-fin rays (modally 17 in P. okamurai, 18 in P. novaeseelandiae, and 16 in P. nigripinnis), and predorsal scales (modally 17 in P. okamurai, 18 in P. novaeseelandiae, and 14 in P. nigripinnis).

N2  - The pyurid ascidian genus Herdmania Lahille, 1888 has been known in Japanese waters by a single species, H. momus (Savigny, 1816), with two later proposed taxa treated as its junior synonyms. My detailed examination of many museum specimens, including most of those recorded from Japan in earlier publications and name-bearing types of the species to be compared, and also of newly collected material, reveals that these waters are inhabited by the following seven species : H. momus (Savigny), s. str. ; H. pallida (Heller, 1878), for which a lectotype is designated ; H. japonica (Hartmeyer, 1909), based on examination of syntypes, with Rhabdocynthia siphonalis Oka, 1933 as a probable junior synonym ; H. mauritiana (Drasche, 1884) (=H. insolita Monniot and Monniot, 2001), based on examination of the holotype of the former ; H. subpallida sp. nov. ; H. kiiensis sp. nov. ; and Herdmania sp. (=H. momus, sensu Millar 1975). A tabular comparison of these Japanese species, together with H. curvata Kott, 1952 (=H. contorta Monniot, 1992, syn. nov.), H. inflata (Van Name, 1918), and H. polyducta Monniot and Monniot, 1989, is compiled on the basis of a reexamination of the name-bearing types or paratypes of these latter species. Specific delimitations are based largely on the detailed structure of the gonads.

N2  - Two new species of the marine monostiliferous hoplonemertean genus Zygonemertes (Nemertea : Enopla) are fully described and illustrated from specimens collected in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Zygonemertes shintai sp. nov. is characterised by a posteriorly lobed central stylet basis, ten proboscis nerves, and anterior pouches of the intestinal caecum that do not reach the ganglionic lobes of the brain. Zygonemertes jamsteci sp. nov. is distinguished from the most similar species, Z. virescens (Verrill, 1879), by having a proboscis as long as the body and a mixed type of pre-cerebral septum. All stages of oogenesis are present simultaneously in mature females of Z. jamsteci. Their oocytes seem to originate from the ganglionic cells of the lateral nerves. All six sectioned specimens of Z. jamsteci were infected by large numbers of unidentified acephaline eugregarines.

Recently 11 specimens of this species were obtained from the northern Sea of Japan at depths of 290-295 m off Ajigasawa in Aomori Prefecture, far to the south of the Sea of Okhotsk, and 18 specimens from off Kushiro, Hokkaido, in the Pacific Ocean at depths of 153-252 m. These occurrences of T. almus represent the first records from Japanese waters, and the Sea of Japan is a new southern range limit. A detailed redescription of the species is provided along with color photographs and scanning electron micrographs. The distribution patterns of starfishes known from the Sea of Okhotsk are reviewed in relation to the zoogeographical significance of T. almus.

A nest of R. celebensis Van der Vecht, 1941 and the mature larvae and details of nest structure of R. rufoplagiata (Cameron, 1905) are also described for the first time. Taxonomic notes and a key to species of the R. plebeja group, which includes R. plebeja, R. celebensis, R. rufoplagiata, R. andamanensis Das and Gupta, 1989, R. turneri Richards, 1978, and R. cristata Kojima, 1989, are provided. New synonymies proposed are R. gravelyi Dover and Rao, 1922 and R. rufoplagiata nursei Van der Vecht, 1941, both under R. rufoplagiata. The colony populations of R. plebeja suggest that this species probably has a nearly solitary life habit.

The kinorhynchs were collected from washings of a brown alga, Padina arborescens Holmes, growing in tide pools in Tanabe Bay, Honshu Island, Japan. Diagnostic characters of E. aureus are the presence of middorsal spines on segments 6-10, lateral spines/tubules on segments 4 and 7-12, a pair of remarkably large subcuticular scars in a subventral position on segment 3, and an incomplete midventral articulation on segment 4. The positions of numerous sensory-glandular organs, the sizes of various lateral spines/tubules, and the shapes of the terminal tergal and sternal extensions are also diagnostic. Echinoderes aureus constitutes the 59th valid species of the genus Echinoderes and the 15th species described from the Pacific Ocean. This is the fourth representative of Pacific kinorhynchs found only in the intertidal zone and the second Pacific Echinoderes living on macroalgae in tide pools. A dichotomous key to all 59 species is provided.

An additional specimen obtained from Hachijo Island in the Izu Islands now allows us to describe more precisely the coloration in life, which is an important diagnostic feature for identifying the species of the genus. The study of one of the two syntypes and other available specimens has revealed morphological inaccuracies in published accounts and made possible the description of the left cheliped for the first time. This species is rediagnosed and illustrated in detail.

N2  - Ten species of mite of the family Macrochelidae (genera Glyptholaspis, Macrocheles, and Neopodocinum) are recorded from the body surface of dung beetles from Bali, Indonesia. Of those mites, two species, Macrocheles baliensis sp. nov. and M. monticola sp. nov., are described as new to science. Neopodocinum spinirostris (Berlese, 1910) is redescribed on the basis of adults and immature stages collected from Bali. Seven species, Glyptholaspis fimicola (Sellnick, 1931), Macrocheles hallidayi Walter and Krantz, 1986, M. krantzi Evans and Hyatt, 1963, M. merdarius (Berlese, 1889), M. oigru Walter and Krantz, 1986, Neopodocinum jaspersi (Oudemans, 1900), and N. spinirostris (Berlese, 1910), were recorded from Bali for the first time. Macrocheles arabaesc nom. nov. is proposed as a replacement name for M. scarabae Chinniah and Mohanasundaram, 1995 (preoccupied by M. scarabae Vishnupriya and Mohanasundaram, 1988).

The results suggest that (1) the location of internal organs relative to the segmentation is not informative for Helobdella taxonomy, (2) body shape may be useful as a species-level taxonomic character for properly fixed specimens, and (3) a purportedly cosmopolitan species, H. stagnalis may need to be separated into more than one species with restricted distributional ranges.

N2  - This paper describes Recent cyclostome bryozoans of the families Densiporidae and Lichenoporidae in the New Zealand region. The Densiporidae are recognised as a family with interior-walled autozooids, exterior-walled brood-chambers, and kenozooids lacking diaphragms. In New Zealand, the family comprises five species of Favosipora, of which four are new (F. candida, F. marmorosa, F. rosea, F. tincta). The generic status of Favosipora is clarified, and its scope expanded to include nine species, of which only one extends into the Northern Hemisphere. Four new combinations are introduced : Favosipora holdsworthii (Busk, 1875), F. nanozoifera (Moyano, 1982), F. otagoensis (Taylor, Schembri and Cook, 1989), and F. watersi (Borg, 1944). New Zealand Lichenoporidae presently comprise five species of Disporella-two new (D. humilis, D. sacculus), and one new species of Doliocoitis (D. cyanea). Disporella buski Harmer, 1915 and D. gordoni Taylor, Schembri and Cook, 1989 are synonymised with D. pristis (MacGillivray, 1884). Sabri's (1988) synonymising of Disporella novaezelandiae (Busk, 1875) with D. novaehollandiae (d'Orbigny, 1853) is accepted.

N2  - Taxonomic problems concerning the identity of the cyclostome bryozoan genus Liripora MacGillivray, 1887 are addressed. The valid type species of Liripora is Diastopora fasciculata MacGillivray, 1885, not D. lineata MacGillivray, 1885 as has often been assumed. This latter species is the type species of Desmeplagioecia Canu and Bassler, 1920 erroneously regarded as an objective junior synonym of Liripora. Scanning electron microscopic study of Liripora shows the genus to have an unusual colony construction : autozooids at distal growing edges have interior-walled peristomes that protrude above the level of a laterally extensive kenozooidal space bounded proximally by a sloping interior wall. Skeletally mature autozooids generally lack or have only very limited areas of exterior frontal wall s. s., the upper surface of the colony being formed instead by the calcified exterior frontal walls of the surrounding kenozooids. In addition to the type species, two new species from New Zealand-Liripora pseudosarniensis and L. lobifera are placed in the genus, which appears to be endemic to Australasia. The three nominal species of Liripora are described, together with Desmeplagioecia lineata and a new species-Mesenteripora triregorum-that shows some resemblance to Liripora.

N2  - A species of marine nematode, Chromadorina hiromii sp. nov., is described based on cultured specimens found in an aquarium containing medusae and polyps of Aurelia aurita (Linnaeus, 1758). The native habitat of the species is unknown, but certainly somewhere on the Pacific coast of Central Japan. Chromadorina hiromii resembles C. cervix (Wieser, 1951) and C. bergensis (Allgen, 1932) but differs from them in having a robust gubernaculum with well-cuticularized lateral pieces and five or six precloacal supplements in the male. Chromadorina hiromii is the second species of the genus known from Japan, the first being C. inversa Wieser, 1955, which was described from a single female collected at Shirahama. An examination of topotypic male specimens of C. inversa is required to understand its relationship to C. hiromii.

N2  - Fishes were collected in freshwater habitats during six consecutive summers (1994-1999) on the 30 major islands of the Kuril Archipelago as part of a joint U. S., Russian, and Japanese biotic survey and inventory, which has come to be known as the International Kuril Island Project (IKIP). A total of 39,269 specimens, representing eight families, 12 genera, and 28 species (including two previously undescribed species, 11 new records for the Archipelago, and 33 new records for various islands), was analyzed in the context of published literature on the freshwater fish faunas of the Kuril Islands and adjacent regions, namely Kamchatka, Hokkaido, and Sakhalin. The geologic history of the Archipelago is reviewed in light of present-day fish distributions. As expected, species diversity, as compared to that of Kamchatka and Hokkaido, falls off abruptly as one moves centrally from both the northern and southern ends of the Archipelago, the number of species dropping to zero on some of the central islands. It appears that differences in island size, and therefore available habitat, are the primary determinant of diversity, coupled with the secondary effects of former connections between landmasses and distance from adjacent source biotas.

The bivalve is dorso-ventrally flattened and pilfers suspended matter intercepted by the host's filtering basket. This new species, Peregrinamor gastrochaenans, can be discriminated from the type species of the genus, P. ohshimai Shoji, 1938, by its laterally more inflated shell with a permanent postero-ventral gape and by the expanded, fleshy posterior mantle protruding from the gape. Adaptations of the bivalve to the small host species and possible functions of the postero-ventral gape are discussed.

Six zoeal stages and one megalopal stage were identified, and detailed descriptions and illustrations are provided for each stage. At an average salinity and temperature of 31±1‰ and 23±1℃, the megalopa was attained 38 days after hatching. Morphologically, the first zoea of C. natator is very similar to those of other species of Charybdis in having lateral spines on the carapace ; three pairs of serrate setae on the posterior margin of the telson furca ; one plus six setae on the endopod of the maxillule ; and five setae on the endopod of the maxilla. The differences between the first zoea and megalopa of C. natator and those of its congeners are discussed.

N2  - Two new mite species of the genus Thinoseius are described and illustrated on the basis of material collected from intertidal zones in northern Japan. Another intertidal species, Thinoseius occidentalipacificus Klimov, 1998, is recorded from Japan for the first time. Thinoseius sawadai sp. nov. and T. occidentalipacificus inhabit tidal wrack, and T. setifer sp. nov. was found on the pleopods of the sea slater Ligia cinerascens Budde-Lund, 1885 (Isopoda). This is the first record of eviphidid mites from a ligiid isopod. The deutonymphs of T. occidentalipacificus and T. setifer show a probable sexual dimorphism in the number of dorsal and/or opisthogastric setae.

N2  - Three new species of oribatid mites belonging to the genus Epidamaeus are described from Mongolia. Epidamaeus granulatus sp. nov. differs from its closely related species in the presence of three setae on trochanter III, the strongly curved spinae adnatae directed anteromedially, and the very thick and strongly barbed notogastral setae. Epidamaeus culterisetosus sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeners by the table-knife-like notogastral setae of the d, l, and h series ; the distally expanded sensilli ; the absence of prodorsal tubercles Da and Bp ; the relatively long and distally projected tubercle Sp ; the different direction of the spinae adnatae ; the long posterior notogastral setae ps_1, ps_2, and ps_3 ; the smooth epimeral and ano-genital setae ; and the different number of setae on tarsi I, III, and IV. Epidamaeus mongolicus sp. nov. is easily distinguishable from the other known species by the strongly developed tectum of the podocephalic fossa, the presence of three pairs of well developed prodorsal tubercles (Ba, Bb, and Da), and the absence of enantionhvses E2 and V.

N2  - A new calanoid copepod, Ridgewayia stygia, is described from a submarine cave in Palau in the Western Pacific. The new species is most similar to a Caribbean species, R. fosshageni, but can be distinguished from the latter by the location of the female genital operculum and the structure of the fifth legs of both sexes. The affinities of the new species appear to lie with the North Atlantic/Mediterranean R. marki species-group rather than the Indo-West Pacific R. typica species-group. This discovery suggests that, within the Tethys Sea, westward dispersal of marine copepods from the Caribbean Province extended as far as the western Central Pacific rather than only to the eastern Central Pacific.

N2  - Two new species of Munnogonium are described from Japan as the first record of this genus from the Western Pacific. Munnogonium armigerum sp. nov. is distinguished from the most similar species, M. adensis Miiller, 1991, by its anterior four pereonites armed with some acute teeth laterally, though the two species share the uniramous uropod and the distomesially projected article 3 of antenna 2. Munnogonium orientale, sp. nov. shows similar sexual dimorphism to that of M. maltinii (Schiecke and Fresi, 1972) : the article 3 of antenna 2 is twice as broad in males as in females. The present new species differs from all its congeners in having a short anterodorsal projection of the head, pleopod 1 with a pair of long, broad, lateral projections, and male coxal plates 1-4 with one spine each.

N2  - Critical examination of abundant material from various localities in Japan and the Russian Far East has revealed that three distinct species have been confounded under the name Pagurus brachiomastus (Thallwitz, 1891). The holotype of Pagurus brachiomastus is no longer extant ; thus, in the interest of nomenclatural stability, a neotype is designated. Pagurus brachiomastus is redescribed and two new species, P. proximus and P. simulans, are described and illustrated. Differences in morphology and coloration are discussed. The three species are, for the most part, geographically or bathymetrically separated, although their distributions may partly overlap.

N2  - Spawning of Luidia foliolata in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, occurs in spring. Ova are transparent and about 150μm in diameter. The first cleavage occurs approximately 3hr after fertilization at ca. 10℃. The embryo develops into a bipinnaria after a wrinkled blastula stage. Metamorphosis takes place about 4 mo after fertilization, without the larva's passing through a brachiolaria stage. The full-grown bipinnaria is 2.5mm long and has five pairs of bipinnaria arms. At metamorphosis the larval part is absorbed into the asteroid rudiment. Juveniles are about 730μm in diameter. They have five arms, each bearing two pairs of tube-feet. The present observations show that L. foliolata undergoes a non-brachiolarian type of development, as do all species of Luidia previously studied.

N2  - Genetic differences between two widely sympatric and morphologically similar labrid species from the southern coasts of Japan, Pseudolabrus eoethinus (Richardson, 1846) and P. sieboldi Mabuchi and Nakabo, 1997, were investigated by examination of partial sequences of the mitochondrially-encoded 16S rRNA gene. For each species, 15 individuals representing three populations were sequenced. Among the individuals of P. eoethinus, only one showed evidence of a sequence difference, whereas nine haplotypes were found for P. sieboldi. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, with a haplotype of Notolabrus gymnogenis (Gunther, 1862) as an outgroup, showed that the haplotypes of the two species of Pseudolabrus are reciprocally monophyletic. Sequence differences between the haplotypes of the two species ranged from 2.9% to 4.2% (3.3% on average), such being comparable to those among the three congeneric species Pseudolabrus guentheri Bleeker, 1862, P. miles (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), and P. biserialis (Klunzinger, 1879) (2.9-3.6%); furthermore, these differences corroborate the specific status of both of the species from Japan.

N2  - The zoeal development of the porcellanid crab Novorostrum indicum is described and illustrated from laboratory-reared material. Zoeal characters of this species appear to support the establishment of Novorostrum. Furthermore, a closer affinity of this genus with Petrolisthes ornatus, P. japonicus, and P. elongatus than with other species of Petrolisthes for which the larval morphology is known, and also the exclusion of P. ornatus from Novorostrum, are supported.

A new genus, Notacanthomysis, is established for two known species, Acanthomysis hodgarti (W. M. Tattersall, 1922) and A. laticauda Liu and Wang, 1980, which are redescribed. The new genus is characterized by the form and armature of the fourth pleopod of the male and the telson.

N2  - Seventeen taxa of aquatic Oligochaeta belonging to four families were recorded from the Ozegahara Mire, central Honshu, Japan, on the basis of specimens collected from 1994 to 1996. Pristinella rosea (Piguet, 1906) is illustrated and recognized as distinct from P. jenkinae (Stephenson, 1931). The oligochaete fauna in bog pools was poorer than that in streams in the Mire, mainly composed of naidids and enchytraeids. On the other hand, a tubificid, Bothrioneurum vejdovskyanum Stole, 1886, which is fully described and illustrated herein, was exclusively common in the bog pools, being abundant at their shallow margins and in temporary waters in the Mire. This species is suggested to be amphibious and to reproduce mainly asexually. The impoverished oligochaete fauna in the bog pools may be due to such factors as instability of water level, low pH, deficiency of available food, and oxygen depletion of the water during the long winters.

Fridericia unisetosa sp. nov. is diagnosed by the absence of spermathecal diverticula and clitellar gland cells dorsally, while Fridericia paraunisetosa sp. nov. is characterized by having 6-8 sessile spermathecal diverticula and dorsal pores from XIII. The only other Fridericia species known to lack lateral setae entirely, the North American F. silvestris (Leidy, 1882), differs in having a longer body and more setae in each ventral bundle.

N2  - The paper outlines the current discussion on the species problem : what actually is a species and how do we recognize such an entity in nature? Six of the major species notions are briefly explained. A distinction can be made between species concepts based on the process of interbreeding and concepts that focus on common descent. Application of these different types of species concept may give incompatible results. It is discussed to what extent we can be certain that the species delimited represent objective realities in nature and are independent of the discovery procedure applied. Further, it is argued that because of the existence of various evolutionary processes, nature can be divided into several natural entities, each representing a species of some sort. The choice of a particular species concept is determined by that aspect or process in nature that forms the focus of one's research agenda. This plea for pluralism should preferably not affect taxonomic procedure ; named species taxa should be based on only one, taxic species concept.

The status of Pseudicyema and Dicyemodeca is briefly discussed and the validity of these two genera is reaffirmed. The majority of the dicyemid species examined was found to be host-specific. In a few instances the same species of dicyemid was detected in two different cephalopod host species belonging to the same genus. Host specificity appears to be characteristic of dicyemid-cephalopod relationships. The largest cephalopod host species, namely Octopus dofleini, Octopus hongkongensis, and Sepia esculenta, harbored dicyemid species with the longest or largest vermiform stages. Two new types of cells are described from the infusoriform embryos of Dicyemennea gyrinodes and Dicyemodeca anthinocephalum. Three additional cell numbers, namely, 41, 42, and 43, are recognized from the infusoriform embryos of Dicyemennea gyrinodes, Dicyemodeca anthinocephalum, and Dicyema dolichocephalum, respectively. The cell types and morphology of infusoriform embryos are briefly discussed.

N2  - A new cyclostome bryozoan, Rodinopora magnifica gen. et sp. nov., is described from the Sea of Okhotsk. It is compared with other genera of fossil and living bryozoans also having stalked, mushroom-shaped or fungiform colonies. This growth-form is notable in being far commoner in cyclostomes than in any other orders of bryozoans. All existing fungiform cyclostome genera are reviewed and briefly redescribed. Seventeen genera are provisionally recognized. These are distributed among 10 nominal families as currently understood. Fungiform growth represents a strategy for elevating the feeding zooids above the surface of the substratum, potentially as a means of preventing overgrowth or of accessing regions of higher current flow in the boundary layer for feeding.

N2  - Direct protein sequencing of the eight hemocyanin subunits from the scorpion Liocheles australasiae gave the N-terminal sequences for the first 16-41 amino acid residues. From sequence comparisons among L. australasiae hemocyanin subunits and between hemocyanin subunits from L. australasiae and Androctonus australis, it is deduced that duplications of two subunits occurred in the lineage of L. australasiae. From the N-terminal sequence comparison among hemocyanin subunits from L. australasiae, A. australis, and Buthus sindicus, it is inferred that at least one orthologous subunit derived from a common ancestor is shared among the three scorpions. Thus, N-terminal sequence analysis is regarded as a good method to identify orthologous subunits among many homologues between species.

N2  - The Parapodisma setouchiensis group (Catantopidae) is revised based on geographic variation in external morphology. This group appears to constitute a single polytypic species, P. setouchiensis Inoue, consisting of four geographic forms (Basic, Mt. Hyonosen, Tanba, and Yamato). Four taxa, Parapodisma tanba, P. yamato, P. hyonosenensis hyonosenensis, and P. hyonosenensis kibi, are treated as junior synonyms of P. setouchiensis. The polarity of character states in the P. setouchiensis group was inferred from the distribution pattern of the geographic forms. All pairs of adjacent forms intergrade through relatively narrow zones that may have originated from secondary contact. In two genital characters (triangular marking and cercus morphology), there are clines with different ranges across the boundary between the Tanba and Mt. Hyonosen forms.

N2  - Life histories and nesting behaviour are presented and illustrated for the eleven species of Pompilidae recognised from New Zealand. Behaviours distinctive for each species are listed, and are related to morphological specialisations of the adult female. Cryptocheilus australis (Guerin) makes multicelled, compound nests in heavy, clay soils. One daughter may occupy her mother's nest and construct further cells extending from the main burrow the following season, while her adult male siblings may continue to occupy the nest. Host spiders are dragged to the nest dorsum up, grasped by the chelicerae. Spiders are positioned upside down, with the chelicerae facing the inner end of the cell. All other New Zealand Pepsinae drag the prey upside down by a leg base to the vicinity of the nest entrance, then drag it into the nest by the spinnerets. The spinnerets point towards the inner end of the cell, while the chelicerae face the cell entrance. Priocnemis (Trichocurgus) monachus (Smith) and P. (T.) conformis Smith prey mostly on mygalomorph spiders, the first stinging the prey to permanent paralysis and usually making deep, multicelled nests in clay soils, although there is considerable variation in its nests. Priocnemis (T.) conformis generally makes single-celled nests and positions the spider in the cell dorsum up. The egg is laid on the dorsum of the spider's opisthosoma. The spider recovers from paralysis and spins a thick web of mat on the cell floor. Priocnemis (T.) nitidiventris Smith usually makes single-celled nests in sand. It runs forwards with its prey spiders, much in the manner of the widely distributed extralimital species Pompilus cinereus (Fabricius). Priocnemis (T.) ordishi Harris is very closely related to P. (T.) nitidiventris but nests in clay, making multicelled nests. It also runs forwards with spiders. Both P. (T.) carbonarius Smith and P. (T.) crawi Harris make single- or multicelled nests in clay. Both species drag spiders backwards. Sphictostethus nitidus Fabricius makes single- or multicelled nests in the soil while S. calvus Harris nests in rotting logs and rotting tree trunks, closing its nests with wood fragments, fibres, and spider web. Sphictostethus fugax Fabricius nests in abandoned beetle holes in wood in trees, closing the nest with moulded mud. In both morphology and behaviour S. fugax has converged towards tribe Ageniellini, but differs in never amputating legs of prey and not running forwards with prey held by spinnerets. Instead, like other species of the tribe Pepsini, it drags spiders backwards by the base of a third leg coxa, grasping prey by the spinnerets only during final placement in the cell. Epipompilus insularis Kohl does not drag spiders to a nest, but oviposits on spiders in concealed places where it finds them, often within the spider's silken cocoon as she guards her eggs. The spider can run about normally after acquiring an E. insularis egg. All New Zealand Pompilidae lack nest cleptoparasites, resulting in some unusual features in nesting behaviour.

N2  - Gaussia princeps (Scott, 1894) (Copepoda : Calanoida : Metridinidae) is redescribed from the Indo-Pacific region on the basis of two adult females, one adult male, and the fifth copepodid stage of both sexes and compared with the holotype from the Gulf of Guinea. The specimens of G. princeps from the Indo-Pacific region showed no remarkable differences from the holotype. The morphological differences from its two congeners are also discussed. The genital compound somite of the female of G. princeps carries paired gonopores and copulatory pores located antero- and postero-ventrally, respectively, without distinct seminal receptacles ; this arrangement differs from those of other genera of the family Metridinidae. Present and previous data indicate that G. princeps is widely distributed in the mesopelagic zone of the oceans throughout the tropical to temperate regions, but there are some morphological evidences that the southeastern pacific population represents a distinct species.

N2  - About 20% of individuals of the comatulid crinoid Comanthina nobilis (Carpenter, 1884) at Shionomisaki, the southernmost point of the island of Honshu, Japan, are infested by the cysticolous myzostomidan worm originally described as Myzostoma platypus Graff, 1887. Up to four cysts per host occur. This parasite had been collected previously only in the Philippines by the 'Challenger' Expedition, from the same host species. The present specimens differ in having a few to many supernumerary marginal cirri and up to six (versus three to five) separate tabular outgrowths in a row along the ventral midline. It is proposed to reassign this species as the most plesiomorphic member of the genus Notopharyngoides Uchida, 1992.

N2  - The classification of the mite family Phytoseiidae in Japan is revised. The 77 species recognized from Japan are assigned to three subfamilies, five tribes, nine genera, and 11 subgenera. Moreover, three large subgenera are divided into a total of 16 different species groups. A new tribe, Indoseiulini, is proposed, Okiseius Ehara, 1967 is reduced to a subgenus of Amblyseius, and three new species, Amblyseius (Proprioseiopsis} nemotoi, Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pseudopyri, and T. (T.) armiger, are described. Additionally, there is a possibility that 'Japanese Amblyseius cucumeris', which was recently reported from Saitama Prefecture in a popular book, is not A. cucumeris (Oudemans), but A. paraki Ehara, a rather common species in Saitama Prefecture. The biology of Japanese phytoseiid mites is also examined, and on this basis the species diversity of the phytoseiid fauna in Japan is interpreted. Finally, relationships between phytoseiid taxa and biological characters are discussed.

A., and southern British Columbia, Canada. It is readily distinguished from other eastern Pacific Pandalopsis by a number of characters including an unusually large number of carpus articulations of the second pereopod and a relatively short outer antennular flagellum and rostrum. Juveniles often associate with the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, while adults reside in deep crevices and under boulders. Like many other species in the genus, it appears to be a protandric hermaphrodite.

Mycomyzostoma calcidicola is a parasitic myzostome inducing cysts on the stalks of Saracrinus nobilis, a crinoid collected around New Caledonia. The main characteristics of the species are the unusual body shape of the female, the total regression of the female parapodia, the absence of digestive caeca in the females, the total regression of the digestive system in the males, and the site of the cysts. The discovery of M. calcidicola re-opens the debate about the probable myzostomidan origin of parasitic traces occurring on pre-Pennsylvanian crinoid stalks.

N2  - Chionelasmus darwini (Pilsbry, 1907) was first collected at 417 to 430m depth near Kauai, Hawaiian Islands. Pilsbry (1911) subsequently recognized that it was distinct from Catophragmus s. s. and proposed the subgenus Chionelasmus to accommodate it. Nilsson-Cantell (1928) elevated Chionelasmus to full generic rank based on a complete specimen collected from 526m depth off Port Mathurin, Rodrigues Island in the western Indian Ocean, largely because the wall turned out to be composed of six rather than eight plates. These two specimens plus 11 specimens from the Hawaiian Islands and three specimens from Madagascar contained in the Benthic Invertebrate Collection of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and one from the Kermadec Islands of the South Pacific (Foster 1981), were utilized in the present study. The morphology of the scutum and tergum and the ontogenetic development of the third and fourth whorls of basal imbricating plates in the Pacific and Indian Ocean populations are different, and therefore a new subspecies, Chionelasmus darwini cantelli, is proposed for the latter.

N2  - Domed mural "hoods" with distinct, pore-like openings occur on the inner accretionary surface of the basal walls of at least twelve species (representing four suborders) of cyclostome bryozoans. The openings are invariably on the proximal side with respect to skeletal wall growth direction. Mural hoods develop independently of skeletal ultrastructural fabric type, with similar structures occurring in walls representing a wide range of fabric suites. The structures are variable in size and shape, varying in outline from sub-circular or oval to pear-shaped, sometimes with a distinct, tubular extension leading to the opening. Variations in hood size and shape in different species may be potentially useful taxonomically to the genus level, and as hard part characters for phylogenetic analysis. The arrangement and direction of hood openings in the protoecium (primary disc) lend support to ultrastructure-based inferences of centripetal growth of the basal floor of the disc.

These species possess two zoeal stages. The zoeae of all four species belong to Group 4 of Osawa (1995), based on the morphological characters of the maxilla, first maxilliped, and telson. The Indo-West Pacific species assigned to this group, except for P. boscii, share a characteristic kind of telson that has a bifid spine at each lateral angle in the first zoea.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships of Platycephalidae and its related taxa were analyzed. Platycephaloidei and Scorpaenoidei form a monophyletic group supported by two synapomorphies : presence of a backwardly-directed opercular spine and an extrinsic muscle derived from the hypaxial. Platycephaloidei and Plectrogenium, the triglids and peristediids are monophyletic, characterized by a posterior pelvic fossa. Bembradium and Plectrogenium constitute a monophyletic group, which divided initially from remainder of the clade. Next Parabembras, followed by Bembras, branched off the latter. Platycephalidae and its sister group, including the triglids, peristediids and hoplichthyids, have 4 synapomorphies. The triglids, peristediids and hoplichthyids share 15 apomorphies. The peristediids and hoplichthyids constitute a monophyletic group supported by 8 synapomorphies. The newly-defined suborder Platycephaloidei includes the following 7 families : Plectrogeniidae, Parabembridae, Bembridae, Triglidae, Peristediidae, Hoplichthyidae and Platycephalidae. Platycephalidae is redefined, being a monophyletic group supported by 6 synapomorphies, and including 2 subfamilies and 17 genera, 3 of them new.

N2  - Discorsopagurus cavicola, the third species of the genus, is described and illustrated on the basis of specimens from Mutsu Bay and Hakodate Bay, northern Japan. It strongly resembles D. schmitti (Stevens) from the west coast of North America, but shows differences in structure of the fifth abdominal tergite, development of the uropodal exopod and relative length of the ocular peduncle. This new species inhabits boreholes made by the rock-boring clam, Barnea manilensis inornata (Bivalvia : Pholadidae) or an uncertain host.
