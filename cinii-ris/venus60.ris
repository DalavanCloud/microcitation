N2  - A new seguenziid gastropod, Basilissopsis hakuhoae, is described from 5473-5762 m depths of the oceanward slopes of the Japan and Kurile Trenches, western North Pacific Ocean. This new species is characterized by its large trochiform shell with a shoulder spiral, a bicarinate periphery, and secondary spiral riblets crossing with sigmoidal axial riblets allover the shell surface. Because the combination of these shell characters would be unique in Seguenziidae, the generic placement of this new species is by no means definitive.

N2  - Satsuma (Luchuhadra) largillierti is an arboreal land snail endemic to Okinawa Island, Japan, and its extensive geographic variation in shell morphology has long caused taxonomic confusion. A recent molecular phylogenetic study demonstrated that S. largillierti and the two species endemic to Okinoerabu Island, S. erabuensis and S. sooi, are more correctly re-organized into two species that are anatomically and genetically distinct. To confirm the taxonomic status and nomenclature of these species, we examined the available type materials and corresponding descriptions. We suggest that the above species be treated as S. eucosmia and S. largillierti, that S. sooi become a synonym of S. largillierti, and that S. erabuensis is reduced to a subspecies of S. eucosmia. We also present revised morphological descriptions of the four Luchuhadra species that range from Iheya Island off Okinawa Island to the Miyako Islands, which are here confirmed as distinct based on both morphological and molecular data.

Halicardia inhabits the bathyal zone, and the specimen, with articulated valves, was evidently deposited at its living site or in deeper water. Associated taxa include bathyal benthic mollusks that were abundant during the Early Miocene.

N2  - Diverse and abundant populations of sacoglossan opisthobranchs inhabit Japanese rocky shores. The species of sacoglossans that feed on the green macroalgae Codium spp. were investigated in and around Sagami Bay on the Pacific coast of Honshu, Japan. On the Miura and Izu Peninsulas, two sacoglossan species were particularly common: Elysia trisinuata Baba, 1949 and E. setoensis Hamatani, 1968. Phenology and algal host use of these species are described. Elysia trisinuata grew substantially larger than sympatric sacoglossan species on Codium with maximum weight of 821 mg. Small E. trisinuata recruited to algal hosts primarily in summer. Some grew and spawned by autumn whereas others apparently over-wintered and spawned in spring. This sacoglossan associated with and fed on 6 of 8 Codium spp. investigated in this study and 4 additional Codium species in other studies. The congener E. setoensis was substantially smaller (max. 64 mg) than E. trisinuata and was frequent on C. fragile and C. intricatum in summer as well as present on 4 other genera of coenocytic green algae (Bryopsis, Caulerpa, Caulerpella, and Cladophoropsis). Although peak abundance of E. setoensis was in spring and summer, this species also persisted through the winter. Five additional species of sacoglossans associated with Japanese Codium spp. are briefly summarized.

N2  - The population dynamics of Batillaria zonalis, an opportunistic feeder, were examined in the Yone intertidal flat on Okinawa Island, Japan, from January 2001 to December 2002. Batillaria zonalis was the most dominant species, although other gastropods were present (B. flectosiphonata and Cerithidea cingulata). The highest density and biomass of B. zonalis were observed during the winter. Batillaria zonalis reached 21.0 mm in its first year of life and a maximum length of 31.5 mm in 9 years, as estimated from von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters. Batillaria zonalis recruited at least four times during the two years, but younger individuals (shell length < 21 mm) were at very low densities compared with a previous study. The small number of recruits and the low density of younger specimens may not sustain the B. zonalis population. Its food sources, the macroalga Ulva pertusa and chlorophyll-a in seawater and sediment, peaked at different times of the year. The season of highest U. pertusa coverage seemed to support the highest B. zonalis biomass. The B. zonalis population declined following a decrease in U. pertusa. The surviving B. zonalis probably lived off a chlorophyll-a in the sediment and seawater; therefore, the population is probably maintained by opportunistic feeding.

N2  - The eulimid gastropod Hypermastus tokunagai was found to be parasitic on the irregular sea urchin Scaphechinus mirabilis. An ecological study of this parasitic snail was conducted monthly from May 2005 to May 2006 in the western part of the Seto Inland Sea. The parasite rather loosely attached itself to the integument of the host by its proboscis, but no hole was observed in the scar formed at the attachment position. Free-living H. tokunagai were also found in the bottom sediment in the survey area. Thus, the mode of parasitism of H. tokunagai is assumed to be relatively independent and association with its host temporary. There was no relationship between the degree of infestation and the size of the host. Most parasites attached themselves to the oral side of the host, with a significant preference for the peripheral portion. The prevalence and the mean abundance increased in the spring and autumn, and decreased in summer and winter.

N2  - To evaluate shell thickness and factors affecting it, weights and heights of 2097 Pomacea canaliculata shells were measured. Specimens were obtained from paddy fields and adjacent canals in two areas in Kawasoe-machi, Saga Prefecture, Japan (33°11'N, 130°19'E), in 2004. Logarithm-transformed shell weights and heights revealed a good regression line, and the deviation of actual weight from expected weight of each shell was regarded as a representative of overall shell thickness (the shell-thickness index). Values of the index were larger in shells collected from canals than in those from paddy fields. Overall, shells appeared to be thinner in June and July than in August and November, irrespective of habitats, presumably due to rapid growth of the snail in early summer.

N2  - Pitar (Agriopoma) japonicum Kuroda & Kawamoto, 1956 has been accepted as the valid name for "Usu-hamaguri", or the Japanese Pitar Venus. However, it is preoccupied by Pitar japonica Ando, 1953, ex Kuroda MS from the Middle Pleistocene in Kobe, southwestern Japan. An examination of the cardinal properties shows P. japonica Ando, 1953 to not be conspecific with P. (A.) japonicum Kuroda & Kawamoto, 1956 but to be a distinct species belonging to Paphia (Protapes). Thus, Kuroda & Kawamoto's (1956) species is a primary junior homonym of Ando's (1953) species. Since Ando's (1953) name was used by Ando (1965), the reversal of precedence (ICZN Article 23.9) cannot be applied. Paphia (Protapes) japonica (Ando, 1953) comb. nov. is proposed and a redescription is presented. In addition, Pitar (Pitarina) kurodai nom. nov. is proposed for P. (Agriopoma) japonicum Kuroda & Kawamoto, 1956.

The vertical distribution range extended from the low to the mid intertidal zone. The density on the shore showed an increasing trend over the 6-year period, with a clear seasonal fluctuation: high in spring-summer and low in fall-winter. The size frequency histogram of each sampling occasion had 1-3 peaks. The maximum shell length was 17.80 mm. By following the temporal changes of the size frequency histograms, the recruitment and growth of cohorts were estimated. Recruitment of new cohorts (3-5 mm in shell length) occurred mainly in winter. They grew up to 10 mm within 8 months. Longevity of cohorts was variable, but always less than one and half years. Previous ecological studies on this genus are reviewed in relation to recent taxonomic work.

Amami-Oshima Island, Kakeroma Island, Tokashiki Island and Kunigami, Okinawa Island (Sasaki & Okutani, 1993; Kubo & Kurozumi, 1995). In 2004 one of us (T. S.) surveyed the molluscan fauna of Iriomote Island, Okinawa (Sasaki et al, 2006) and unexpectedly collected specimens of the genus Nipponacmea, which is mainly distributed in temperate areas. As a result of morphological examinations they were identified as N. fuscoviridis based on shell characters, animal pigmentation and radular sac configuration. In addition, molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the material is genetically conspecific with temperate population of N. fuscoviridis. We report this interesting range extension in this paper.

N2  - We found a new species of tellinoidean bivalve in coral reef lagoons of the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. The lagoons were dominated by the seagrass Halophila ovalis. The new bivalve is minute and slightly inequivalve; the shells are extremely flattened; there are unique hinge teeth with a developed, vertically oriented resilium and vestigial external ligament; commarginal lamellae are widely spaced and sharp; inhalant and exhalant siphons are elongated; inner and outer demibranchs are triangular. We here name the new species Semelangulus lacrimadugongi. Definitive familial placement awaits further revision of related genera in the Tellinidae and Semelidae. The known habitats of this bivalve are the remaining areas in which dugongs survive, or have survived until recently.

N2  - Following analytical studies on the two forms (Japanese names: Awaji-chihiro and Yami-no-nishiki) of Volachlamys hirasei, fossil specimens in genus Volachlamys from Japan were examined. The fossil specimens were from the Kazusa Formation (1.7 Ma), the Kitaarima Formation (0.9 Ma), the "Maiko Shell-Beds" (Early-Middle Pleistocene), the Takatsukayama Formation (0.41 Ma), the Atsumi Group (0.44 Ma), the Kioroshi Formation (0.125 Ma) and a seaside alluvium in Takamatsu (0.006 Ma). In addition to these, Recent specimens collected from the Seto Inland Sea were examined. Shells of the specimens were measured, and growth was analyzed by observing the annuli on the shell surfaces. In the fossil specimens, the Yami-no-nishiki form was detected in the Atsumi, Kioroshi and Takamatsu samples; it appeared in 1 of 44 individuals in the Atsumi sample, 1 of 2 individuals in the Kioroshi sample, and 17 of 39 individuals in the Takamatsu sample. The remaining specimens were comprised entirely of the Awaji-chihiro form, suggesting that the Yami-no-nishiki form first appeared around the middle Pleistocene. Morphologically, although shell proportions and costae number were unique by locality, there were no samples that were particularly specialized. On the other hand, the shell weight index (SWI) of the Maiko sample was prominently lower, indicating that these shells were much thinner and lighter than the other specimens. The growth analysis revealed distinctly greater growth in the Maiko specimens, although the other specimens (including the Recent ones) showed similar growth rates to one another. These results suggest that only the Maiko specimens were genealogically distinct from the others. The fossil specimens of Volachlamys from Japan were generally supposed to be Volachlamys yagurai, being treated as a species distinct from V. hirasei. The specimens from the "Maiko Shell-Beds", which is the type locality of V. yagurai, have biological characteristics so different from those of the Recent specimens that they are treated as a distinct species; however, in the other fossil specimens, significant characteristics that differ from those of the Recent specimens of V. hirasei could not be detected. These results indicate that only the fossil individuals from the "Maiko Shell-Beds" are referable to Volachlamys yagurai, and those from all other localities should be assigned to Volachlamys hirasei, which is common to the Recent specimens.

N2  - Juvenile specimens of two scaphopod species with the protoconch intact were collected from Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. One has a hexagonal cross-section with six longitudinal keels and is identified as Dentalium octangulatum; the other is of an unidentified species. Dentalium octangulatum differs from other known species in having a smaller protoconch A and an extremely long protoconch B. The protoconch of the unidentified species matches the type 1 protoconch of Dentaliida. The differences in protoconch morphology may reflect those in larval ecology, but this hypothesis should be tested by developmental studies.

N2  - A fossil Ellobium is recorded for the first time from the uppermost Lower Miocene Tate Sandstone Member of the Kadonosawa Formation in Iwate Prefecture, northeastern Honshu, Japan. The Tate species is comparable with the Recent Ellobium aurisjudae (Linnaeus) living in Indo-Pacific mangrove swamps. This is the northernmost record of the genus in East Asia through the Cenozoic. The occurrence of Ellobium in the member is regarded as new evidence for the presence of mangrove swamps in northeastern Honshu in the latest Early Miocene age.

N2  - Size-related differences in the day/night activity pattern and habitat preference of the herbivorous snail Gibbula umbilicaris (Gastropoda: Trochidae) on Posidonia oceanica leaves were investigated by a laboratory experiment. Snails were sampled at Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples) from a depth of 3 m, in December 1995. Some snails of three different size classes were individually placed in an aquarium and offered two types of differently epiphytized P. oceanica leaf fragments . Four types of behavior (rest, shaking epipodial tentacles without any other motion, directional movements, and shell twisting mainly for foraging) were recorded. Large sized snails showed a particularly high activity at night and were mostly inactive during the day, but this clear day/night pattern became weaker with decreasing snail size. However, by summing up the data for a 24-hour cycle, the relative proportion of the different behavioral types is similar for all size classes. Small sized snails utilized the two types of leaf without preferences, while larger sized snails mainly foraged on the apical, more epiphytized parts of the leaves. In the presence of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, only the small sized snails changed their behavior, becoming more active in feeding.

N2  - The ovary and associated appendages of the rare epipelagic octopus, Ocythoe tuberculata caught alive near the harbor of Naoetsu Port, Sea of Japan on 15 February 2005, were examined histologically. The ovary was 40 g in weight, and contained approximately 60,000 eggs. The oocytes, in variously developmental stages, were attached singly to lamella-like stalks. The ovary possesed a central cystic coele, with a complex labyrinthine form in cross section. Each ovoid oocyte in the early stage had a prominent round nucleus (= germinal vesicle) containing several nucleoli. Numerous oocytes were surrounded by an intricately folded follicular epithelial layer. Large spherical oocytes had significant yolk accumulation. Deeply infolded mucosae were present in the proximal part of the oviduct, whereas shallowly intricate mucosae were detected in the distal part of the oviduct, which was surrounded by thick muscular and fibrous connective tissues. The shape of the oocytes and pattern of oogenesis of this epipelagic octopus were similar to those of coastal and deep-sea octopods.

N2  - Glochidia and juveniles of two species of Margaritifera were examined in the Sakasa River at Togakushi, Nagano Prefecture, and four other localities in Japan. The shape and size of the glochidia were similar in both species, but the surface sculpture of the glochidial shell was different: smoother in M. laevis and rougher in M. togakushiensis. On the other hand, juveniles were oblong and flat in M. laevis, but ovate and inflated in M. togakushiensis. Most of them could be consistently separated using a discriminant function estimated from the shell length and shell height. Juveniles obtained in the other four localities were also identified with one or the other species by using the discriminant function. About 40 days after infection, the glochidia metamorphosed into juveniles on the host and the discriminant function is also applicable to the parasitic juveniles.

N2  - A shell collected in July 1988 was brought to my attention several years ago. Since then no other similar material has been found, and attempts to obtain more material remained unsuccessful. This is probably due to the locality, which is far away from usual field trip localities. However, the particular spiral cord morphology and the unusual pattern of the varical fronds separate this species definitively from any other known form of Triplex. The terminology used here to describe the spiral cord morphology is based on the standard terminology established by Merle (1999, 2001) for each major sequence of appearance of the primary and secondary cords.

N2  - The family Turridae is highly diverse in most world oceans from shallow to deep waters and from high to low latitude (Tucker, 2004). Even within Japan, at least 394 species have been recorded (Higo et al, 1999: G3479-3872), and we frequently encounter undescribed or unidentified specimens. It is highly likely that the diversity of the family in Japan is not adequately reflected in the literature. The genus Aliceia Dautzenberg & Fischer, 1897 is poorly known. There are only two described species in the world, both of small size. Aliceia aenigmatica Dautzenberg & Fischer, 1897 has been recorded from bathyal depths (1800-1980 m) in the Azores (Bouchet & Waren, 1980: 91), and Aliceia simplicissima (Thiele, 1925) was collected from off Indonesia and Zanzibar at depths of 356-470 m (Sysoev, 1997: 345, fig. 57). A possible third species (Bouchet & Waren, 1980: 90) was represented by an unidentified specimen reported by Kay (1979: 364, fig. 115N) from a depth of 700 m off Lanai, Hawaii as "Thatcheriasyrinx sp." During a series of dredge survey off Ogasawara Islands, southern Japan, the first author collected a previously unknown species of Aliceia. This paper describes this interesting new species.

N2  - The genus Panacea is a member of the Pholadomyoidea and comprises just six rare species in the world (Coan, 2000). In the Indo-Pacific region and adjacent areas, there are only three known species in the genus: P. sumatrana Thiele & Jackel, 1931 from Indonesia (175 m deep), P. tasmanica (Hedley & May, 1914) from Tasmania, southern Australia (91 m deep) and P. chilensis Coan, 2000 from Chile (130-180 m) (Coan, 2000). During a research cruise by the R/V Tansei-Maru, the first author (TS) collected a single valve of an unknown species of Panacea. We describe this species here as the first reliable record of the genus from Japan.

N2  - Yagura's scallop, Volachlamys yagurai (Makiyama, 1923), is a Pleistocene pectinid species from Japan. It was described as Pecten yagurai by Makiyama (1923) on the basis of "Pliocene" specimens from Maiko, Hyogo Prefecture. Prior to this publication, "Pecten yagurai Makiyama" was briefly introduced by Yagura (1922) for the same taxon from the same locality. The latter was intended to be published after Makiyama (1923), because Yagura (1922) noted "Pecten Yagurai was described as a new species by Mr. Jiro Makiyama, Kyoto Imperial University, in September, 1922". P. yagurai Yagura, 1922 is regarded as the earliest available name, because it was accompanied by photographs as an indication of new status (ICZN Art. 12.2.7). Consequently, Pecten yagurai Makiyama, 1923 is regarded as a junior synonym and a junior homonym of Pecten yagurai Yagura, 1922. Lectotypes of both taxa are designated herein for the fixation of the taxonomical confusion.

N2  - In the second part of a review of the genus Fusinus in Japan, several species commonly confused or associated with F. undatus (Gmelin, 1791) and F. similis (Baird, 1873) are examined via their types and material from various collections. F. undatus and F. similis have been frequently confused in literature, but are here shown to be separate species. F. similis is further compared with the types and other examples of the morphologically similar F. galatheae Powell, 1967, F. bountyi Rehder & Wilson, 1975 and F. genticus (Iredale, 1936). In addition, F. sandvichensis (Sowerby III, 1880), F. michaelrodgersi Goodwin, 2001 and R midwayensis Kosuge, 1979 are illustrated for comparison. The new species Fusinus mauiensis is described from Hawaii, where it is apparently endemic to the island of Maui. Lectotypes are selected for Fusinus undatus, F. similis and F. sandvichensis.

N2  - The tropical mussel Modiolus philippinarum is common and abundant in seagrass beds in Okinawa Island, southernmost Japan, and is commercially important to local fishermen. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that maintain the difference in density between benthic populations of the mussel within and outside seagrass beds, we monitored temporal variations in densities of the mussel at different developmental stages (planktonic larvae; new settlers; small and large individuals) within and outside seagrass beds in Okinawa Island over one year. Based on these data, the difference in larval density was not significant, but there were significant differences between densities of new settlers (shell length<250μm), small individuals (250μm≦shell length<1.0mm) and large individuals (shell length≧1.0mm), within and outside seagrass beds. Cohort separation was applied to data for shell length distributions of new settlers and small and large individuals, and revealed that larvae mainly settled in July to August. New settlers grew up to about 20 mm in shell length in their first year; their mortality was constant and/or low once individuals had attained shell lengths of about 300μm. These facts indicates that the much higher density of benthic populations of the mussel within seagrass beds may be determined at and/or shortly following larval settlement, though details of the mechanisms driving the above difference are not yet identified.

N2  - The reproductive behavior of the Japanese spineless cuttlefish Sepiella japonica was observed in a tank. The males competed for females before egg-laying and then formed pairs with females. The male then initiated mating by pouncing on the female head, and maintained the male superior head-to-head position during the mating. Before ejaculation, the male moved his right (non-hectocotylized) arm IV under the ventral portion of the female buccal membrane, resulting in the dropping of parts of spermatangia placed there during previous matings. After the sperm removal behavior, the male held spermatophores ejected through his funnel with the base of hectocotylized left arm IV and transferred them to the female buccal area. The spermatophore transfer occurred only once during each mating. The female laid an egg capsule at average intervals of 1.5 min and produced from 36 to more than 408 egg capsules in succession during a single egg-laying bout. Our results also suggested one female produced nearly 200 fertilized eggs without additional mating, implying that the female have potential capacity to store and use active sperm properly. The male continued to guard the spawning female after mating (range=41.8-430.1 min), and repeated matings occurred at an average interval of 70.8 min during the mate guarding. Although the time spent on the sperm removal in S. japonica was shorter than in other sperm-removing cuttlefishes, the shorter sperm removal duration may be compensated by the post-copulatory mate guarding and repeated matings in this species.

N2  - In recent years, the volume of the Japanese short neck clam Ruditapes philippinarum imported from China, South Korea and North Korea has increased rapidly to compensate for the decrease in domestic production in Japan. Imported clams are generally released in areas already inhabited by the same species, and it is feared that they may affect the domestic populations. It is necessary to understand the genetic characteristic of the various local populations to manage and conserve biodiversity. However, the genetic variation of the Japanese short neck clam from Japan and the other countries has not been studied. This study was therefore designed to analyze the genetic variation among local populations from Japan and China using nucleotide sequence of the M and F types COX1 gene from the mtDNA of Japanese short neck clam. The nucleotide sequence for the total length of the M-type (1608 bp) and F-type (1599 bp) COX1 gene of 39 male individuals collected during the spawning season (November to May, 2004) from nine locations in Japan and China was determined. In the M-type COX1 gene, the number of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions were higher than in the F-type COX1 gene. Both the M-type and F-type COX1 gene revealed differences in nucleotide sequence between Japanese and Chinese populations, which were clearly grouped in the phylogenetic trees (MP and NJ methods). In addition, the Japanese populations were divided into two subgroups by the M-type COX1 gene, the Honshu-Kyushu (Tokyo Bay, Mikawa Bay, Nanao Bay, Miyazu Bay and Ariake Sea) and Hokkaido (Notsuke Bay) groups. The Chinese populations were also divided into two subgroups, these from the North (Dalian Bay and Kiachow Bay) and those from the South (Xiamen Bay).

The ratio of shell height to shell length in the glochidia was not a suitable character to identify these two species, because it varied largely in A. japonica.

N2  - To reveal the mechanism of androgenesis, we observed chromosomes, centrosomes and microtubules in fertilized C. fluminea eggs from meiosis to first mitosis. We also observed fertilized eggs of C. sandai, in which development is normal. In C. sandai, one of the centrosomes attached to the egg cortex and the other remained in the center of eggs at metaphase of meiosis. The spindle axis at metaphase of meiosis was perpendicular to the egg cortex. On the other hand, in androgenetic eggs of C. fluminea, two centrosomes attached to the egg cortex. The spindle axis was parallel to the egg cortex. As a result, all egg chromosomes were extruded with two polar bodies at first meiosis. Only the male pronucleus remained in eggs after the polar body formation. C. fluminea has two centrosome attachment sites, while C. sandai has only one attachment site at meiosis. We deduced that the change of attachment site may cause the androgenesis in C. fluminea. We also measured the size of male pronucleus in C. sandai and C. fluminea fertilized eggs during meiosis. At 20 min after fertilization, all egg chromosomes were extruded with two polar bodies in C. fluminea. Meiosis of C. fluminea was apparently completed at 20 min, but the male pronucleus didn't enlarge until 40 min had elapsed. At 40 min, the male pronucleus started to enlarge, which coincides with the period of second polar body formation in C. sandai. We suggest that the cell cycle of second meiosis is still functional in oocytes of C. fluminea.

It has hitherto been known from four specimens in museum collections; two in the Kuroda Collection in Nishinomiya Shell Museum, and two in the Kawamura Collection in the National Science Museum, Tokyo. In order to clarify the taxonomic status of this snail, the author carried out two field samplings on the islet in 2002 and 2004, with the permission of the Agency for Cultural Affairs, Japanese Government, and collected seven live specimens. Careful examination of this material, together with additional specimens collected by Mr. Masaru Naka, revealed that it is a distinct new species, and the description is given in the following lines.

N2  - The shipworm Zachsia zenkewitschi Bulatoff & Rjabtschikoff, 1933 lives inside the rhizomes of the eelgrasses Phyllospadix and Zostera (Helobiales; Zosteraceae) and has sporadic distribution records from Primorskii Krai (=Primoriye Region) to Siberia in the Russian Far East and in Japanese waters (Higo et al, 1999). Its detailed distribution and habitats have been surveyed in detail only locally along the coast of Vladivostok in Primoriye (Turner et al, 1983; Fig. IF). In Japanese waters, this species has been recorded in only three catalogues of local molluscan faunas (Fig. 1; Inaba, 1982; Kano, 1981; Kuroda & Habe, 1981). These catalogues, however, did not provide information on detailed collecting sites and habitats. This rare species was recently rediscovered along the coast of Miyagi Prefecture, northeast Japan (Sasaki et al, 2006; Fig. 1C). Z. zenkewitschi has dwarf males and exhibits remarkable sexual dimorphism. Bulatoff & Rjabtschikoff (1933) noted the presence of larvae' within the female body with a long tail-like appendage and an internal shell. Turner & Yakovlev (1983) confirmed that the larvae' are dwarf males, a rare example of sexual dimorphism in bivalves. Subsequent authors studied the biology of Z. zenkewitschi in detail and determined that: 1) spawning occurs 2-5 times in summer; 2) fertilization then takes place in the suprabranchial cavity of the female using sperm received from the dwarfmales; 3) after fertilization, the larvae are brooded until they grow to the straight-hinge stage; 4) the released larvae settle on the rhizomes of the eelgrass after a short planktonic stage; and 5) the larvae either crawl into the lateral pouches of a female within the rhizome and grow into dwarf males or develop into females in cases where the rhizomes are free from any adult female (Drozdov et al, 1999; Turner et al, 1983; Yakovlev et al, 1998). However, it is still not yet known how this species dispersed so widely despite its short-term, free-swimming larval stage. Turner & Yakovlev (1983) observed that the larvae swam mostly near the bottom of a culture dish in their laboratory. They hypothesized that in natural environments the larvae can swim only for short distances within the eelgrass beds and that wide dispersal might have been achieved through long-distance transportation of the host eelgrass by accidental drifting. However, this hypothesis has not been verified to date. This report is the first documentation of Z. zenkewitschi in drifted rhizomes of eelgrass, and describes the soft animal morphology of this species.

N2  - The organisation of the Placophora is compared with that of the Conchifera and of the aplacophoran Solenogastres and Caudofoveata. This analysis, with special emphasis on the threefold regionated alimentary tract and the excretory system, not only reveals a close relationship of the Placophora with the Tryblidia (part of paraphyletic *Monoplacophora*), but also recognises that the Placophora and Conchifera represent a monophyletic group of Testaria. Synorganisationally, other characters shared (as *Aculifera*) only with the aplacophoran molluscs represent plesiomorphies rather than synapomorphies. In contrast to some earlier assumptions, the Placophora cannot be regarded as being derived from the conchiferan level; rather, there is a well-defined organisational sequence of gradually additive characters (anagenesis) from the a-placophoran to the poly-placophoran and to the mono-placophoran (conchiferan) configuration. The organisation of the Placophora thus plays a key role in bridging the conservative aplacophoran and the derived conchiferan evolutionary levels within molluscs.

N2  - A progression of modes of dorsal exoskeleton formation can be discerned from the Precambrian to the present in mollusc-like and molluscan forms. Examined here are the known modes in Polyplacophora, Aplacophora, Neopilina, Nautilus, Unionid bivalves and other Conchifera, and the probable modes in Kimberella, Halkieria, Wiwaxia, Maikhanella, Multiplacophorans, and Acaenoplax. The steps in the evolution of sclerites and shells seem to be from (1) mantle cuticle alone (Kimberella), to (2) development of sclerites that fuse within a cuticle matrix (Maikhanella), to (3) development of sclerites or sclerites and shells embedded in cuticle formed over the body, the sclerites formed within invaginations of individual cells and the shells by accretion onto a properiostracum (Halkieria, Wiwaxia, Polyplacophora including the Multiplacophora, Aplacophora, and Acaenoplax), to (4) loss of sclerites and development of periostracum at the mantle edge and shell formed by aragonite columns within cells that then become attached to periostracum at the mantle edge (Nautilus, probably Neopilina), to (5) crystallization in a vacuolated middle layer of periostracum (Unionid bivalves, Mytilus), to (6) crystallization directly onto periostracum from extrapallial fluid. In 4, 5, and 6 there is loss of sclerites, the shell is not embedded in mantle cuticle covering the dorsum, there is greater variation in morphology of the foot for locomotion, and there is a concomitant loss of iteration of the exoskeleton. Acaenoplax and Wiwaxia are considered not to belong to either the Mollusca or Annelida, but to the clade Spiculata that includes all the forms under discussion.

N2  - In order to build a natural classification of the chitons, a new approach is proposed that uses not only the shells, as usual, but also other suitable features including aesthetes, girdle, radula, gills, glands, egg hull projections, spermatozoids etc. Several previous classifications are discussed. A brief review of the evolution of the Polyplacophora is given and a new classification of the chitons is proposed. The roles of the articulamentum and the reductions in the tegmentum in chitons are discussed. The evolutionary line of the reduction of slits is shown for the superfamily Cryptoplacoidea. Specifically, the genera Hemiarthrum, Weedingia and Choriplax, which have unslitted valves, have been removed from the order Lepidopleurida and reassigned to the order Chitonida within the Cryptoplacoidea. Affinities of these and other genera within the Cryptoplacoidea are discussed.

N2  - The last common ancestor of Chitonida, the largest order of chitons, evolved unique mechanisms of fertilizing elaborate eggs with dart-like sperm that are typical of the group. In contrast Leptochiton asellus and other Lepidopleurida [sensu Sirenko 1993], have retained the plesiomorphic condition with smooth-hulled eggs and sperm with prominent acrosomes. The mechanism of fertilization in L. asellus is expected to be similar to scaphopods and some other mollusks, because of basic similarities in sperm and egg design. By this mechanism, the acrosome reaction releases enzymes that digest a large hole in the jelly layer and vitelline layer. An acrosomal process polymerizes and extends the inner acrosomal membrane down to fuse with an egg microvillus. A fertilization cone is raised up through the vitelline layer and engulfs the sperm including the nucleus, centrioles, mitochondria and part of the flagellum. The transition to elaborate egg hulls and reduced acrosomes, which characterize all Chitonida, may be evident as intermediate stages among certain lepidopleurids, such as Deshayesiella curvata and Hanleya hanleyi, which have eggs with smooth hulls but sperm with smaller acrosomes on short nuclear filaments. Furthermore, Callochiton dentatus is of special interest, as it has retained a similar egg to D. curvata but its sperm is derived, like all other chitonids. Fertilization follows the chitonid pattern, in which a tiny acrosome digests a hole in the vitelline layer that permits only the injection of chromatin into the egg. The fertilization cone remains below the vitelline layer and so does not engulf the body of the sperm. Thus sperm organelles seem to be abandoned on the egg surface in a bag of sperm membrane. This suggests that centrioles, as well as mitochondria, of Chitonida are maternally inherited. New characters developed for Callochiton dentatus, Deshayesiella curvata and Hanleya hanleyi, have enabled a revision of previous phylogenies. The revised analysis suggests that Callochitonidae is the sister taxon to all of Chitonida and is not part of the order Lepidopleurida [sensu Sirenko, 1993]). Furthermore, Lepidopleurida appear to be a paraphyletic grouping. The Chitonida are still clearly divisible into the two suborders, Chitonina and Acanthochitonina.

N2  - The major lateral radula teeth of chitons (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) are composite materials, incorporating a variety of biominerals within an organic scaffold. While magnetite is ubiquitous to these teeth in all Polyplacophorans whose radulae have been described to date, this is not the case for the biominerals of the tooth core. In situ analsysis, using energy dispersive spectroscopy, to determine the distribution of elements in chiton teeth, and Raman spectroscopy, to identify the biominerals present, has been undertaken in the mature teeth of seven chiton species representing three families in the suborder Chitonina. The results show the tooth core to be comprised of a variety of elements, with the main biominerals identified as limonite, lepidocrocite and hydroxyapatite. Along with Ischnochiton australis, all five representatives of the Chitonidae deposit an apatitic mineral in their tooth core, while Plaxiphora albida does not deposit any calcium biomineral. With the exception of Acanthopleura echinata, the hydrated iron (III) oxide, limonite, is found in all species, including I. australis, which has relatively small amounts of iron in its tooth core. The lack of any evidence for a phosphate mineral in species that possess high levels of phosphorus in their core, challenges the long accepted notion that the presence of phosphorus implies its deposition as a biomineral. The combined techniques of energy dispersive spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy provide a simple and effective means to evaluate, in situ, the biomineralisation strategies employed by chitons. While the results from this study are inconclusive in determining whether biomineralisation strategies reflect phylogenetic affinities in chitons, an extension of the study to include a wider range of chiton taxa could provide a basis for the utilisation of radula tooth biomineralisation as a systematic tool in this class of molluscs.

N2  - The chiton fauna of the Magellanic region is investigated based on material from various expeditions and collecting trips made between 1958 and 2003. In total, 15 species of chitons, including one probably undescribed species are recognized in this region. Among them, 14 species inhabit the Magellan Strait, Beagle Channel and Estados Island, and 11 species live near the Falkand Islands. Comparisons of these faunas reveal that the shallow water chiton fauna of the Falkland Islands is the most impoverished in the Magellan Strait. Eleven other species that were mentioned in the literature for the Magellanic region are discussed. Four brooding species were found with eggs and juveniles in their pallial grooves, and the brooding habit of Ischinochiton stramineus and Tonicia lebruni are reported for the first time.

The new species resembles F. caribbensis Sirenko, 1988 from the Caribbean Sea at a depth of 6780 m by having rather raised valves that lack insertion plates. The similarity between the present species and the distantly distributed F. caribbensis may support Sirenko's hypothesis of the origin and radiation of the family Ferreiraellidae.

N2  - Morphological, genetic and ecological analyses were performed on the Japanese chiton Acanthopleura japonica. Two morphological forms were identified. Spots were not observed on the shell plates of A. japonica collected from rocky shores around northern Japan (Form A). Two large black to dark-brown spots were observed in each shell plate, although sometimes not in the head plate, in populations from the Inland Sea, in the southwestern part of Japan (Form B). It is easy to discriminate Form A from Form B solely on the basis the pattern of the shell surface in both young and old specimens, despite the old ones being somewhat eroded. The 705 bp nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) region of Form A was 7.66% different from that of Form B. Form-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns were consistently observed when PCR-amplified COI region was digested with restricted enzyme FokI. These two haplotypes co-occurred on some shores in central Honshu. Form A tended to be abundant in the seaward quadrants and co-occurred with the barnacle Tetraclita japonica, whereas Form B was abundant on the landward quadrants and co-occurred with a population of the rock oyster Saccostrea kegaki at Nabeta Bay. There was a tendency for Form A to attach to the side of a rock facing the sea, whereas Form B were distributed on the same rock facing the shore, suggesting that the microhabitat of Form A and Form B may be different. Although Form A and Form B hybridize artificially, there is a possibility that these two haplotypes are reproductively isolated. We consider Form A and Form B to be in a sibling relationship.

N2  - Moving patterns and homing behavior in Acanthopleura gemmata and A. tenuispinosa were investigated on the rocky shore of Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan. In the daytime, both A. gemmata and A. tenuispinosa moved only when washed by sea water, while at night they moved not only when washed by water but also when they were exposed to the air. Almost all chitons rest in a fixed 'home' site in the daytime and during periods when the rocks are submerged. They do not move when strong sunlight heats the rocks in their habitat either. Surface temperatures of dry rocks under such conditions have been measured as high as 64.8 C. When under water, they suffer the risk of predation by fish or other carnivorous invertebrates. Their movement patterns can therefore be explained as avoidance of heat and desiccation of rock surfaces and predation. Homing behavior in these species was observed throughout the period of study. Homing and moving patterns of A. gemmata and A. tenuispinosa were studied to compare daytime and nighttime activity, including when they go out and when they come back 'home'. The nighttime activity was longer than the daytime activity, and activity patterns were slightly different between these two species. The speed of movement was not significantly different between when they go out and when they return. Vying for use of locations as 'home' and cognitive behavior were observed, suggesting that cognition of geographic features is found among chitons.

N2  - Population density and size composition of Acanthochitona defilippii were investigated over a six-year period on a boulder shore at Amakusa, Japan. The vertical distribution range was restricted to the mid and low intertidal zone. The density on the shore varied haphazardly in space and time, but the highest density occurred around the mean tide level. The density showed a slightly decreasing trend over the 6 years at the mean tide level. Seasonal changes in density were detected in individuals of the 2-4 mm size class (fifth valve width), with high density in winter and low density in summer; however seasonal change in the density of smaller individuals (<2 mm) was not apparent from the data. Analyses of size frequency histograms showed bimodal or unimodal patterns, but it was difficult to detect seasonal change of size mode caused by the growth of individuals, or seasonal recruitment of small individuals. These seasonal patterns, which do not show clear modal changes in density fluctuation or size composition, may be caused by low recruitment rate, low growth rate, and/or low rate of mortality.

N2  - Chitons are known for their ability to incorporate significant amounts of magnetite (Fe_3O_4) into their radular teeth. Previous studies have classified the mineralization process according to the developmental sequence of the second lateral teeth. In this study, the radular teeth of a chiton Acanthopleura japonica were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) in order to examine the composition and two-dimensional distribution of minerals in the tooth cusps. Crystalline components detected by XRD were magnetite (Fe_3O_4), goethite (α-FeOOH), lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) and hydroxyapatite (Ca_5(PO_4)_3(OH)). EPMA revealed a negative correlation between Fe and (Ca, P) in the two-dimensional elemental distribution within a tooth cusp. These results indicate that A. japonica exerts a sophisticated level of control over the biomineralization of mineral species during tooth development, from their crystalline condition to their spatial and sequential deposition. The maturation of the second lateral teeth in A. japonica is here divided into five stages.

N2  - Molluscs hitherto recorded from deep-sea vent/seep environments in Japan are reviewed and listed based on various literature published up to 2004. Compiled data on holotype depositories and type localities as well as detailed distribution records with geographic and depth ranges, and type of habitat (vents and/or seeps) are given for each of 74 recorded species (2 polyplacophorans, 30 bivalves and 42 gastropods). Comparison of faunas at various localities revealed the following characteristics: 1) The Japanese vent/seep fauna is typified by the highest diversity of Calyptogena in the world. 2) Bathymodiolus is the second most diversified large-sized bivalve in Japanese vents and seeps. 3) Conspecific populations of Calyptogena and Bathymodiolus have been proven to occur both in vents and in seeps, but most other molluscan taxa are obviously either vent-or seep-specific. 4) Two major groups of deep-sea bivalves, protobranchs and anomalodesmatans, are rare or totally absent, in contrast to non-vent/seep environments. 5) Vent/seep-endemic limpets are highly diversified. 6) Neomphalids and peltospirids (so-called 'hot vent taxa') are absent, except for a single species. 7) Among caenogastropods, small-sized provannids (Provanna) are dominant, rather than large-sized ones (Alviniconcha and Ifremeria). 8) Naticid predators have never been found in the Recent fauna, although fossil records suggest their presence in seeps in the geologic past. 9) Some species of neogastropod predators have been reported as temporal invaders from the ambient environment. 10) Two species of chitons from vents in the Okinawa Trough represent the only record of polyplacophorans from chemosynthetic communities in the world. 11) No aplacophorans, monoplacophorans, scaphopods or cephalopods have been collected at Japanese vent/seep sites.

Primovula astra n. sp. is closely similar to Primovula oryza Omi & Clover, 2005 in overall morphology, but it can be distinguished by its non-beaked posterior extremity and different dorsal marking. Phenacovolva vitrea n. sp. is most similar to Phenacovolva tayloriana Azuma & Cate, 1971, but differs from it in forming short and callously rimmed terminals, and having less flared margin.

In total, 14 specimens in 4 lots were found and identified as M. galloprovincialis, all of which were collected in the 1930s and 1940s and donated by the physician Tamizo Furukawa. Two specimens collected at Hiroshima before 1934 represent the earliest collection that we know of among all the specimens of this species existing in Japan. Six specimens collected at Kanazawa, Kanagawa Prefecture in 1937, and two specimens from Obama, Fukui Prefecture before 1948 were regarded as the earliest collections that we know of among the specimens collected in Tokyo Bay and the Japan Sea, respectively. The initial invasion history and range extension of this species into the Seto Inland Sea, Tokyo Bay and the Japan Sea is discussed, focusing on the first record in each sea area.

N2  - Two freshwater snail species of the genus Semisulcospira, S. libertina (Gould) and S. reiniana (Brot), inhabit various areas in the Japanese Islands. It has been pointed out that these two species are indistinguishable by their adult shell morphology. In the present study, genetic and morphological variations of the adult shell of the two species were examined, and the genetic relationship between them was inferred through starch gel electrophoretic analysis. The individuals examined of 19 populations mainly in the areas of the central to eastern Japan were separated into two almost-isolated groups without natural random mating between them. The Mpi locus is fixed for the allele Mpi^A in one group (MpiAA type) and for the allele Mpi^B in the other group (MpiBB type) except a few heterozygous individuals. The MpiAA type individuals live throughout the central to northeastern areas and Okinawa island in Japan, while the MpiBB ones are distributed in the area west of the Kanto district. As to the morphological features of adult shells, 85 percent of the MpiAA type individuals have smooth shells with no ribs, and pronounced ribs are recognized on the shell of 53 percent of the MpiBB type individuals. Except for the rib feature, there is no appreciable difference in the adult shell morphology between the two groups. Considering these morphological features and previous taxonomical research, the MpiAA type and MpiBB type individuals are assignable to S. libertina and S. reiniana respectively. According to molecular phylogenetic tree based on the gene frequency at 12 gene loci, MpiBB type individuals are inferred to be derived from a population of MpiAA type individuals.

N2  - Intertidal molluscan communities were surveyed on six lava boulder shores on Sakurajima Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, which has a large active volcano. Each shore was thought to have different geological characteristics since they consist of lava extruded during four volcanic eruptions (A.D.1471-76, 1779, 1914, 1946). This study aims to show the relationship between the community structure of intertidal Mollusca and the characteristics of boulders on the shore as well as to compare the intertidal molluscan fauna of shores formed by different eruptions on Sakurajima Island. The survey was carried out between May and July 2001. The number of each species and the size of boulders in quadrats placed at regular intervals were recorded. Thirty species were found on the six shores and the density of all species showed more than ten-fold differences in the middle intertidal area between the shores with the highest and the lowest densities. Cluster analysis did not group molluscan communities in the shores with lava extruded during the same eruption because of variation within each shore. The result of multiple regression analysis showed that number of species increased with decreasing tidal level and increasing surface area of boulders per quadrat, and that the number of molluscan individuals increased with the mean volume of boulders.

The density of individuals reached its maximum in April, and fell to a minimum in May. The plant reached its maximum length in May, and thereafter decreased to reach a minimum in November. These seasonal changes in plant length preceded changes in the abundance of I. parcum by one month. Newly settled juveniles of I. parcum appeared in July, and grew rapidly thereafter. The lifespan of the gastropods was estimated to be one year.

Glochidia and juveniles that became detached from the hosts were counted daily. Juveniles appeared about six days after glochidia attachment. L. echigonia is thought to be a suitable host, on which over 10% of attached glochidia metamorphosed to juveniles.

N2  - A new species of mytilid mussel, Gigantidas horikoshii n. sp., is described. This new species was found burrowing in a sandy bottom from which warm water was seeping out, on the submarine volcano Kaikata Seamount, located southwest of the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands in Southern Japan. G. horikoshii n. sp. is characterized by the absence of a welldeveloped valvular siphonal membrane, the absence of a continuation of the inner mantle fold across the anterior adductor muscle and by the attachment point of the anterior retractor on the valve being situated out of the umbonal cavity in the same manner as in G. gladius, the only other known species of the genus Gigantidas. The present species is distinguishable from G. gladius by the large swollen umbonal cavity, the markedly concave ventral margin and shell proportions such as shell height and shell width relative to shell length.

N2  - A new species of the Chamidae from Japan is described under the name of Chama cerinorhodon n. sp. Chama cerinorhodon has hitherto been misidentified as Chama fragum Reeve, 1846, from its superficial morphological characters. However, it is here revealed that this species is sufficiently distinct from true C. fragum in shell mineralogy and shell structure to warrant separate status. Chama cerinorhodon has a calcitic outermost shell layer in addition to aragonitic inner and median shell layers, whereas C. fragum has only aragonitic inner and outer shell layers. Chama cerinorhodon is closely related to the eastern Pacific species Chama arcana Bernard, 1976, and Chama pellucida Broderip, 1835, in shell morphology, mineralogy, and structure.

N2  - As a result of field investigation of the limpet fauna in southwestern Java, Indonesia, we have found 9 species of limpets (belonging to 3 families and 4 genera) including a new species. Lottia luchuana (Pilsbry, 1901) and Cellana toreuma (Reeve, 1854) are new records from this area. A new species of the Patelloida profunda group is described in this paper. Members of this group are morphologically similar to each other, but Patelloida javanica n. sp. can be distinguished by the orange colour of the intermediate area between the muscle scar and the shell margin, and by its vague yellow or reddish brown radial streaks.

N2  - Two new species of alycaedid gastropods collected from Miyazaki Prefecture, Southeastern Kyushu, Japan, are described: Chamalycaeus shiibaensis and C. nishii. The former species is morphologically most similar to C. sadoensis (Pilsbry & Hirase, 1903), from which it is distinguishable in having fine ribs behind the aperture and by the shape of the unreflected peristome. The latter species resembles C. takahashii Habe, 1976 and C. tsushimanus (Pilsbry & Hirase, 1909), but differs from them by its smaller size and a swelling on the neck.

N2  - The genetic differentiations between seep areas off central Honshu (the Japanese mainland) and hydrothermal vent fields in the Okinawa Trough were examined for two vesicomyid species, Calyptogena okutanii and Calyptogena nankaiensis, on the basis of nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. For each species, significant genetic differentiation was detected between the two sea areas. Relatively highly diverged haplotypes were detected for both species. An asymmetrical distributional pattern of haplotypes was also shown for C. okutanii. As a similar phylogeographic pattern was revealed for another species inhabiting both sea areas, namely, C. solidissima, the migration of three Calyptogena species between seep areas off central Honshu and hydrothermal vent fields in the Okinawa Trough might be attributable to the same historical events.

N2  - Genetic and morphological divergence in the endangered freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera laevis from Nagano Prefecture is investigated. We reveal the existence of two genetically divergent forms within the mussels. The two forms occurred sympatrically in one of four sampling locations and displayed complete allelic substitutions at four allozyme loci, suggesting an absence of hybridization between them. Their shell morphometries were also different. These findings strongly suggest they are two distinct species. A conservation program should be designed for each of the two forms.

N2  - Host preference in Margaritifera laevis was investigated via field and laboratory studies on two populations in the Shinano River System. Although there was no difference in the growth curve of glochidia during the parasitic period, or in the size of the resulting juvenile mussels, the host species were different. The masu trout (Oncorhynchus masou masou) was the host in the Chubu-Nogu River but not in the Sakasa River, whereas the whitespotted char (Salvelinus leucomaenis) was the host in the Sakasa River but not in the Chubu-Nogu River. This difference in host species suggests that there may be two Margaritifera species in Japan.

N2  - The embryonic and larval development of the trochid gastropod Umbonium moniliferum (Lamarck, 1822) is described, based on material reared in filtered seawater at 22.6-25.1℃ in the laboratory. Fertilized eggs were obtained via artificially induced spawning of adults collected from an intertidal sand flat in southern Japan in October 2002. Each egg was 170μm in diameter, surrounded by a vitelline membrane and a gelatinous coating. The trochophore larvae hatched at 6h after fertilization, and became veliger larvae at 8h, with the completion of the velum. At 48h, the larvae began to crawl on the substratum and swim in the water column alternately. Metamorphosed larvae (= juveniles) of 200-μm shell width appeared at 200h, with the velum lost. This was induced by the provision of sediment inhabited by adults and seawater agitation. The reported time for larvae of the other two congeneric species to reach the metamorphosis is shorter [48h in U. vestiarium (Linnaeus, 1758) at 28-30℃; 3d in U. giganteum (Lesson, 1833) at 20℃]. The longer time required in the present case could reflect delayed metamorphosis due to lack of more appropriate stimuli.

N2  - Seasonal changes in size and density of a potamidid snail, Cerithidea cingulata (Gmelin, 1790), were studied on a tidal flat neighboring the mangrove forest at the mouth of the Atago River, southern Kyushu, Japan. Juvenile snails smaller than 2mm in shell width occurred from October through May, suggesting recruitment during this period. The proportion of snails with lips retroflexed was higher at the upper site than at the lower site. The seasonal change in size structures suggests that it takes two years for juveniles to become large-sized snails with retroflexed lips.

The density of individuals reached its maximum in June, when the plant length of S. ringgoldianum was decreasing, and fell to a minimum in February when the plant length was increasing. The seasonal changes in abundance of C. japonicus followed the changes in S. ringgoldianum with a lag of two months. Newly settled juveniles of C. japonicus appeared in May and November, and grew rapidly thereafter. The longevity of the snails was estimated to be 18-20 months.

N2  - From among gastropod specimens collected from the hydrothermal vent site at Kairei Field near the Rodriguez Triple Junction in the Central Indian Ocean, by the ROV Kaiko and the crewed submersible Shinkai 6500, three new species are described: Bruceiella wareni, Desbruyeresia marisindica, and Iphinopsis boucheti. The occurrence of an Alviniconcha species very similar to A. hessleri, is also reported.

N2  - Four fasciolariid species from Japan and the Western Pacific are examined and described. The shell consistently misidentified as Fusinus longicaudus (Lamarck, 1801) in Japanese literature is identified as F. perplexus (A. Adams, 1864). Fusinus longicaudus (Lamarck, 1801) is treated as a junior synonym of F. colus (Linnaeus, 1758). Fusinus perplexus nagasakii Grabau, 1904 is shown to be a junior synonym of F. perplexus, and the synonymy of F. inconstans Lischke, 1869 with F. perplexus is reaffirmed. Comparison is also made with F. forceps (Perry, 1811) and F. salisburyi Fulton, 1930. Lectotypes are selected for F. perplexus, F. p. nagasakii, F. inconstans, F. forceps, F. turriculus (Kiener, 1840) and F. ferrugineus Kuroda & Habe, 1960, which is provisionally retained as a valid species.

N2  - Calyptogena (Archivesica) edisonensis n. sp. is described from the hydrothermal vent field of the New Ireland Basin (Edison Seamount). This is the first taxonomic description of a vent-associated Calyptogena from the Southwest Pacific. This new species is closely allied to C. (A.) nankaiensis from the Nankai Trough off Honshu, Japan.

N2  - Based on fertilized eggs obtained from artificially induced spawning of the brackish water clam Corbicula japonica, the larvae and post-larvae were reared for 18 days in the laboratory. Planktonic larvae of C. japonica passed through the trochophore and D-shaped larval stages (the early stage of veliger larvae), but lacked umbo larvae (the latter stage of veliger larvae), with the result that the late-stage D-shaped larvae with a developed foot settled and metamorphosed on the bottom and walls of culture vessels. To aid in the identification of the larvae of C. japonica in plankton samples and their post-larvae in benthos samples, larval and post-larval shell morphology of the clam is described and compared with that of the other bivalves dominant in Japanese estuarine waters.

N2  - Drift and upstream movement of the freshwater snail Semisulcospira libertina were investigated at the Iwai River, Nara, Japan, from May 1999 to February 2000, in natural conditions. Water temperature, snail size and discharge were measured. Drift and upstream-movement were observed mainly from May to October, when water temperature was higher than 13.2℃. Most drifted snails were smaller than 6mm in shell width, whereas snails that moved upstream belonged to all size classes. The number of drifted snails per hour after rainfall (60≦discharge<130l/s) was smaller than during normal discharge (<60l/s), whereas the number of snails moving upstream per hour did not change between the normal discharge days and days after rainfall. From these results, it is concluded that small S. libertina disperse downstream by drift on days with normal discharge, and snails of all sizes move upstream irrespective of discharge rate.

B. hirtus n. sp. is characterized by having anteriorly situated umbones and a distinctly hirsute shell surface. B. securiformis n. sp. has an elongate shell with a short and low anterior part, a high and expanded posterior part, and a deep ventral concavity. Some anatomical characters also separate these new species from hitherto known species.

A second species from central Japan that was previously misidentified as T. maxmarrowi is here described as Thaluta takenoko sp. nov. It differs from the type species in part by having a paucispiral rather than a multispiral protoconch. A series of specimens from Australia with an unknown protoconch may represent a third species of Thaluta. The geographic range of T. maxmarrowi is extended to South Africa. Comparison is made with the genera Thala H. & A. Adams, 1853, Mitromica Berry, 1958 and Zierliana Gray, 1847, with particular reference to Z. anthracina (Reeve, 1844)

N2  - An isolated cephalopod beak was discovered in the Lower Miocene unit of the Ichishi Group at Iedokoro, Misato Village, Mie Prefecture, central Japan. It measures 39.7mm in maximum length and consists of large outer and short inner horny lamellae, with a conspicuous anterior calcified tip; the outer lamella is divided into a pair of posteriorly elongated wing portions. In the absence of the strongly convex, posteriorly elongated inner lamella that occurs in the upper beaks of all extant cephalopods, the present specimen is identified as the lower beak. The overall morphological features suggest a closer phylogenetic affinity to Recent Nautilus (Nautilidae) than to the coleoids, but the paired wing portions are more elongated than those of the lower beaks of Nautilus. We provisionally refer this cephalopod beak to the genus Aturia, because large mature shells of Aturia cubaensis occur in the same horizon.

Fourier coefficients and their principal components were used to compare shell shapes among taxonomic subgroups and life habits. This study reveals differences in shell outline between the tribes of byssate and free-living pectinids. Byssally attached species of the Pectininae have more rounded and equilateral shell outlines than those of the byssate Chlamydini and Mimachlamydini. Free-living pectinids generally possess circular and equilateral shells, except for some species of the Decatopectinini. This study suggests that the change of life habit from byssally attached to free living required Chlamydinae to modify their shell outlines considerably, whereas only a minor modification of the outline enabled the byssate Pectininae to adapt to free-living habits. Patinopecten, which represents the only free-living scallop in the Chlamydinae, has a shell outline with a smaller aspect ratio than most of the free-living Pectininae. This suggests that a vestige of the oblong shell shape of typical Chlamydini still remains in the shell of Patinopecten, showing a phylogenetic constraint.

N2  - A new shallow water Chama species is described based on shells collected from Melanesia, Polynesia, southern Japan and Aldabra Island, Indian Ocean. The species attaches itself to the substrate by a narrow portion of the left valve. The right valve is subcircular, slightly inflated, and bears three dark brown spiral streaks on the outer surface. The outer surface is ornamented with commarginal fluted lamellae, giving a honeycomb-like appearance. The left valve is nearly smooth and well inflated. The shell is composed of two aragonitic layers. This new species clearly differs from Chama japonica Lamarck by its characteristic honeycomb-like ornamentation.

N2  - An octopus collected by a bottom trawl survey off Tajima Region in the western part of the Sea of Japan, was identified as Octopus longispadiceus (Sasaki, 1917). A total of 506 specimens were examined either in raw, defrosted or formalin fixed conditions. Both females and males were collected from depths of 175 m to 300 m, and mature individuals appeared all year round. The sex ratio is nearly 50 %. The maximum size is 458 mm in TL(total length) in males and 485 mm in females in raw condition. This species is mediumsized and mature at 240 mm in TL in males and 265 mm in females. The mantle surface is generally smooth. The dorsal mantle length is about 25 % of TL. The mantle opening extends about half of the body circumference. The funnel organ is thickly W-shaped with a long central ramus in formalin fixed condition. The total number of gill lamellae is 20-23. The arms are slender, with a formula of I>II>III>IV, and the longest arm is about 75 % of TL. Suckers are biserial, about 130 in number on arm I of a male specimen of 300 mm in TL. Males have enlarged suckers at 15-30th from the base on all arms. The right third arm in mature males is hectocotylized and longer than the left third arm. The hectocotylus is slenderly conical and of about 6 % of TL. The terminal organ is crescent-shaped in raw condition. The maximum length and diameter of the spermatophore are 90 mm and 1.4 mm, and those of the egg are 22 mm and 9 mm, respectively. An ovary posesses 30 to 50 eggs. Judging from egg size, newly hatched juveniles crawl on the seabed, with no planktonic phase.

N2  - Density in relation to habitat of the alien freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and the indigenous Semisulcospira spp. were investigated for a year in a channel in Moriyama City, Shiga Prefecture, central Japan. Water depth, velocity, water temperature, DO, pH, EC, Ca^<2+>, COD, NH^<4+>, NO^<3+> and substratum were measured and analyzed as environmental factors. As a result of variable selection following Hayashi's Quantification Theory Type I, velocity and substratum were selected most frequently by both P. antipodarum and Semisulcospira spp. The density of P. antipodarum was low throughout the year on a pebble substratum, whereas other combinations of environmental factors and species varied between sampling seasons. Laboratory experiments showed that adult Semisulcospira had no preference for any kind of substratum, whereas juveniles preferred a tile bottom with algal cover to a sandy bottom without cover. Adult P. antipodarum preferred a tile bottom with pebble cover or a sandy bottom with algal cover whereas the juveniles preferred substrates with any kind of cover. Adults and juveniles of both species preferred a slow current of less than 10 cm/s. The large gap between field survey and laboratory experimental results suggests that the tolerance ranges of substratum and velocity are much broader than the preferred ranges of both snail taxa. Juvenile P. antipodarum was less tolerant of water flow, suggesting that populations cannot establish themselves in turbulent flow on a coarse substrate.

N2  - The relationship between body length and color of Elysia ornata (Swainson, 1840) was examined by laboratory experiment and field observation. The results indicated that the difference in body color is not an individual variation but is related to growth. Body coloration follows a sequence from transparent, pale green, dark green, greenish white and to beige, with the length reaching maximum size at dark green, and decreasing thereafter. Based on these results, it was inferred that E. ornata has an annual life cycle beginning in late spring.

N2  - We collected and observed Corbicula samples in the Lake Biwa-Yodo river system and Yamato river system to determine whether invasion of the exotic Corbicula fluminea has occurred. In the Lake Biwa-Yodo river system, C. fluminea has invaded, and the indigenous C. leana has disappeared in the Yodo River. C. fluminea consisted of diploids and triploids. These samples were hermaphrodites and produced non-reductional sperm, suggesting androgenetic reproduction. We could not find C. fluminea in the Yamato river system, and only the indigenous C. leana exists. The present study suggests that the invasion of exotic C. fluminea may result in the extinction of the indigenous C. leana.

N2  - The mode of feeding by Conus tulipa on fishes was observed to differ markedly from that of other piscivorous congeners such as C. striatus, C. fulmen and C. geographus. Conus tulipa swallows the prey fish into its rostrum together with a large quantity of water, but the present observations did not determine whether or not a radular tooth is injected. The role of a set of unusual structures, here termed 'coronary rostral tentacles', in C. tulipa feeding is described. Another unusual habit of this species is group feeding. In the laboratory, several individuals attacked a single prey animal, which was eventually swallowed by one of them.

N2  - The symbiotic association of the myid bivalve Cryptomya (Venatomya) truncata with thalassinidean shrimps was investigated together with morphometric variation on tidal flats in western Japan, including the Nansei Islands. Several specimens of C. truncata were found buried very close to the burrows of Upogebia major, U. yokoyai, U. carinicauda and Callianassa japonica. In each case the bivalve was found with its posterior end facing the burrow tunnel at about 5-20 cm deep in the sediment, suggesting that the bivalve was a filter feeder using the shrimp burrow as an extended siphon. Cryptomya truncata was also found in sediments with abundant burrows of U. issaeffi, U. narutensis and U. pugnax, although direct evidence of a symbiotic association was not obtained. Morphometric analyses showed that C. truncata grew taller and thicker in shape ontogenetically, probably as a result of its symbiotic lifestyle with a reduced need to use its long siphons. Cryptomya truncata from Amami-Oshima Is. were smaller and thicker than those from Honshu, Okinawa Is. and Ishigaki Is.

N2  - Bivalves on subtropical sandy beaches are potentially important food resources but, in general, estimating their abundance has been thought to be difficult due to a high variability in their density. This study quantitatively demonstrates the vertical distribution of Atactodea striata and Latona (=Donax) faba on a sandy beach in Ishigaki Island in southwestern Japan in the summer. Both species occurred over a wide vertical range in the intertidal zone with their peaks around the mean tide level. Associated bivalve fauna consisted of Donacilla picta, Davila plana, and Katelysia hiantina, but all were very rare. The vertical distribution patterns of A. striata and L. faba did not change between the low and high tides due to the small range of migration, which was revealed by the recapture of marked bivalves during 6 hrs and 24 hrs on very fine and calm days in the summer. Size-frequency histograms showed that small individuals (probably juveniles) were predominant in the populations of both species. The low efficiency of sampling at high tide and the intraspecific zonation by size suggested that the sampling should be carried out over the entire range of the intertidal zone at low tide.

N2  - Tree climbing behavior of the snail Cerithidea rhizophorarum A. Adams, 1855 (Gastropoda : Potamididae) was observed in a mangrove forest at the mouth of the Atago River, southern Kyushu, Japan. The forest is dominated by Kandelia candel (L.) Druce and Hibiscus hamabo Sieb. et Zucc. It is the northern limit of distribution of mangroves in the west Pacific. C. rhizophorarum was in the intertidal zone of the tidal flat most of the time but occasionally climbed up the trunks of mangrove trees The number of snails that climbed up trees in 100 m^2 decreased between June and August, but suddenly increased in late August and fluctuated between 1000 and 2000 through January. The number of snails inhabiting the tidal flat kept decreasing from June to December and increased from January through April. A larger proportion of snails moved off the trees in summer than in winter. There was a clear ebb and flow rhythm in the locomotion activity which synchronized with the tidal shift in the summer. Snails tended to fall onto the tidal flat at low tide and to climb up trees at the high tide. Snails aggregated on particular trees regardless of the physical traits of the trees. The climbing behavior of C. rhizophorarum seems to be dependent on both seasons and the ebb and flow rhythm of locomotion.

In 1997, more specimens were obtained from off the Kii Peninsula, and we herein re-describe O. oyasiwo on the basis of both sets of material. Shell morphology is compared in detail with a confusingly similar species, Odostomia desimana Dall & Bartsch, 1906. All the live-collected specimens examined in the present study were found on the shell of Fusinus perplexus (A. Adams, 1864), although it is not possible to determine whether this pyramidellid actually parasitizes F. perplexus without further observing the behavior of living O. oyasiwo.

N2  - Two closely related batillariid snails, Batillaria multiformis and B. cumingi, commonly occur together on tidal flats around Tokyo Bay. During the last decade, however, local populations of B. multiformis have declined precipitously or become extinct, while those of B. cumingi have remained stable or even increased. The results of this research, which consisted of population status surveys of the batillariid snails in an enclosed tidal flat in Tokyo Bay and a rearing experiment of B. multiformis, suggest that the differences in status between these two species could be explained in terms of their respective life cycles ; while B. multiformis produces egg capsules that hatch into planktonic larvae, B. cumingi spawns isolated eggs that hatch out as benthic juveniles. Since the late 1960s, extensive coastal landfill has eliminated most of the tidal flats and salt marshes that originally formed a continuous ring around the Tokyo Bay shoreline. Only a few suitable tidal habitats remain, and these are isolated from one another. The planktonic larvae of B. multiformis may thus be unable to drift to a suitable habitat for settling out. In addition, severe bottom hypoxia occurs in the bay during the summer months, when the larvae are released, and this may adversely effect their survival rate. In contrast, the benthic juveniles of B. cumingi are able to recruit directly on their parent tidal flats, which are not impacted by the coastal landfill or hypoxia, making it easier for them to maintain or expand their local populations.

N2  - In order to aid specific identification of the larvae (D-shaped and umbo larvae) and post-larvae of the two tropical Modiolus species M. auriculatus and M. philippinarum common in shallow waters around Okinawa, southern Japan, we describe and compare the morphological features of their shells based on larvae and post-larvae reared in the laboratory observed with optical microscope and SEM. The umbo larvae of M. philippinarum are distinguishable from those of M. auriculatus by differences in hinge morphology, shell color, and the size of the shell at the time when eyespots appear. The post-larvae of M. philippinarum are also distinguishable from those of M. auriculatus by differences in hinge morphology, shell color and the size of shell at the time when primary lateral teeth and periostracal hairs appear. The umbo larvae of Modiolus species (M. auriculatus, M. philippinarum and M. modiolus) are not distinguishable from those of other genera in the Mytilidae described in past studies, except that the umbo larvae of Perna possess primary lateral teeth. The post-larvae of the above Modiolus species are distinguishable from those of other genera in the Mytilidae described to date by a combination of the three types of lateral teeth, bearing only primary lateral teeth.

N2  - We surveyed distributions of Bradybaena pellucida and B. similaris in the Boso Peninsula. B. pellucida is known to occur discontinuously in western Japan and in a limited area around Tateyama, at the southern end of the Boso Peninsula. B. similaris is cosmopolitan, distributed on most islands of Japan. The two species are closely similar to each other in shell and genital morphology, except for the color of the mantle surface, which is visible through the shell. We have found that B. pellucida predominantly occurs across the southern Boso Peninsula and is sympatric with B. similaris at several localities. B. similaris is dominant north of the range of B. pellucida.

N2  - Activity rhythms, homing and reproductive behaviors of the hermaphroditic pulmonate mollusc Peronia verruculata (Cuvier, 1830) were investigated on a rocky intertidal zone on Sesoko Island (26°38′N, 127°54′E), Okinawa. The molluscs stayed in holes in the rock while the habitat was submerged or washed with seawater. Animals emerged and were active only when their habitats were completely exposed. All individuals showed homing behavior. The number of emerged individuals, the distance moved and the duration of excursions were inversely related to the lowest tidal level at ebb tide. Animals that emerged were fewer and less active at night than during daytime. Initial courtship of individuals as males was seen 21 times, and in 5 cases copulation occurred. Peronia verruculata (Cuvier, 1830) played a positive role as males but a passive role as females in courtship behavior and copulation.

N2  - The oviparous snail Cerithideopsilla djadjariensis (K. Martin, 1889) is distributed on tidal flats in south-west Japan. Seasonal changes in the distribution of C. djadjariensis were studied in the world's northernmost mangrove forest at the mouth of the Atago River in southern Kyushu Island. Four gastropod species : Batillaria multiformis (Lischke, 1869), Cerithideopsilla djadjariensis (K. Martin, 1899), Cerithideopsilla cingulata (Gmelin, 1791) and Cerithidea rhizophorarum A. Adams, 1855, show sympatric distribution in this area. Newly recruited juveniles (3-6 mm shell length) of C. djadjariensis appeared from August to November. To established the main habitat of the four species, the substrate on the tidal flats was classified into six types ; gravel, sandy gravel, sand, muddy sand, sandy mud and mud. From the patterns of distribution of the four species on the tidal flat, C. djadjariensis prefers sandy mud and muddy sand ; B. multiformis prefers sandy gravel and sand, and C. cingulata prefers the muddy sand and mud. Stomach contents were observed under a fluorescent microscope with a rhodamine filter in order to determine the food preference among the four species. It is suggested that Cerithidea rhizophorarum has a stronger preference for algae than the other three species.

N2  - Seasonal changes in size and density of the three bivalve species, Acropsis (Galactella) symmetrica (Reeve, 1844), Barbatina (Abarbatia) lima (Reeve, 1844) and Cardita leana Dunker, 1860 were studied in the intertidal area on a lava seashore in southwestern Japan. These three species are distributed sympatrically on a boulder shore on Sakurajima Island (31°35′N, 130°36′E) in Kagoshima Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. Juveniles (<3 mm shell length) of A. symmetrica were frequently observed from September to December. A. symmetrica seems to be an annually-reproducing species. In B. lima, juveniles were observed from August to March. Juveniles of C. leana were observed in April and from October to December. Frequency distributions of shell size suggest lifespans for B. lima and C. leana to be more than one year. B. lima was found distributed widely from the lower to the middle zones, while the other two species were limited to the lower zone. It was estimated that most of the newly settled juveniles of B. lima died in the middle zone. The density of B. lima was greatest in the middle zone in June, and in the lower zone in November.

N2  - During recent dives by the crewed submersible Shinkai 6500 in abyssal depths on the landward slope of the Japan Trench (5343-5379 m), five gastropod and four bivalve species were collected from seep environments. The gastropods include a recently described species in the Neomphalidae, two new species in the Provannidae, a single species in the Buccinidae, and a new species in the Cancellariidae. Bivalves are represented by a single species of the Solemyidae, a single species of the Thyasiridae and two species of the Vesicomyidae, the most of which were previously described from greater depths in the same trench.

N2  - The distribution of molluscan species at six cold-seep sites at between 5291 and 6290 m on the landward slope of the Japan Trench was studied using the crewed submersible Shinkai 6500 and the ROV Kaiko. At least four species of bivalve (Acharax johnsoni, Calyptogena phaseoliformis, C. fossajaponica and Parathyasira kaireiae) and three species of gastropod (Retiskenea diploura, Provanna abyssalis, and Provanna shinkaiae) were determined to be endemic to chemosynthesis-based communities. Two gastropod species (Bayerius arnoldi and Admete tenuissima) were confirmed to be colonists in chemosynthesis-based communities. The molluscan assemblages were of differing composition at each site. The two dominant bivalves, C. phaseoliformis and C. fossajaponica, showed specific differences in their distributions. C. phaseoliformis was mainly associated with silt sediments, whereas C. fossajaponica dominated the aggregations on pebble substrates. However, in a single case of co-dominance by both Calyptogena species, almost all individuals were of small size. The small gastropod Retiskenea diploura was found in clusters on the shell surface of C. phaseoliformis and on the silt sediments within the aggregations. This is the first record of a species of the family Neomphalidae from a chemosynthesis-based community in Japanese waters. The Molluscan faunal assemblages of cold-seep communities in the Japan Trench are similar at the familial and generic levels to those of cold-seep communities in the eastern Pacific, especially the Aleutian Trench subduction zone.

N2  - Spatio-temporal patterns of the populations of two congeneric buccinid gastropods Japeuthria ferrea and J. cingulata on an intertidal stony shore in the western Pacific were surveyed. The two species had similar patterns of life history and maintained stable population densities from July 1994 to October 1995. The smallest cohort appeared in August and rapid shell growth was observed in both species during the warm months from May to October. The data suggested that both species live at least four years. J. ferrea reached 11 mm in shell length in the first year, 17 mm in the second and 22 mm by the third year. J. cingulata reached 13 mm in the first year, 20 mm in the second year and 26.5 mm in the third. Recruitment occurred mainly at the mid-tidal level and there was a clear downward shift in the mode of distribution in both species as body size increased. Dispersion analysis revealed that Japeuthria individuals were more strongly aggregated towards the edge of their vertical distribution.

N2  - Copulatory behavior of the simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail, Achatina fulica Bowdich, 1822 (Gastropoda : Pulmonata : Achatinidae) was observed by radio-tracking. Snails with attached radio-tags were in the latter two of the three age groups here established ; juveniles, young adults and old adults. The home ranges of young adults were larger in area than those of old adults. The cumulative dispersal distances from release points of young adults were greater than those of old adults. The courtship initiator and courtship acceptor showed very different mating behaviors. Young adults copulated more frequently than old adults. In many cases, young adults held the courtship initiator role when they copulated, while old adults were courtship acceptors. Young adults initiated courtship with old adults more frequently than old adults did with young adults. Multiple copulation was confirmed for every individual observed in the field. Young adults moved around wide areas searching for their mating partners and positively chose old adults as their mating partners. On the other hand, old adults stayed within a narrow area and showed passive mating bahviour. The mating manners of A. fulica clearly correspond to protandrous maturation. Since young adults are able to produce only sperm, it would be advantageous for them to copulate with older adults that can produce both eggs and sperm.

Frequency distributions of shell size showed that newly hatched juveniles appeared in April, but their recruitment did not seem to be concentrated in any specific period over a year. In the intertidal area, the vertical distribution range of J. cingulata was larger than that of Cronia margariticola (Broderip, 1833) and Morula musiva (Kiener, 1836). Juvenile J. cingulata occurred in the lower zone, while adults occurred from the lower zone to the middle zone (broadly defined). No seasonal change of distribution in the intertidal area was observed.

N2  - The ancient Nakasuji sand dune on Taramajima Island in the Sakishima Archipelago features two layers of intercalated eolian dust paleosol. The eolian dust layers have yielded terrestrial molluscan fossils in large numbers. There are in all 21 species of land mollusc, including six now extinct on the island. The fossils are predominantly minute fossils, but larger specimens are also preserved well without severe damage. This indicates that these assemblages are autochthonous. The species composition of the minute fossils differs from layer to layer. Gastrocopta (Sinalubinula) armigerella and Tornatellides boeningi are dominant in the lower paleosol layer and the underlying sand layer, while Georissa japonica, Carychium cymatoplax, Platyrhaphe hirasei nudus and Aphanoconia yaeyamaensis dominate the upper layer. Judging from the habitats of their Recent counterparts, it is inferred that the fossil assemblages in the lower layers were formed near the coast lines and that those in the upper layer were formed in and around coastal forests. This could be due to a fall in sea level associated with glacial eustasy in the last ice age.

N2  - A new neritiliid species Neritilia mimotoi is described from an anchialine lake on Kamikoshiki Island, Kyushu and estuaries on Shikoku Island, southwestern Japan. This is the second species of the genus described from anchialine habitats. The great variation in shell form and radular morphology of this species has not been previously documented in the family. Anatomical characteristics unique to the species are the presence of a flap-like projection posterior to the left eye and a rudimentary seminal receptacle, both found in females. The egg capsules are reinforced by diatom fragments. They are widely scattered over stones and leaves, as well as laid on shells of other individuals, most frequently on the inner lip callus of males.

N2  - A new species, Bathymodiolus marisindicus n. sp., is described based on specimens collected at a hydrothermal vent site in the Indian Ocean. This new species differs from B. thermophilus by the absence of the inner mantle fusion and a very short valvular siphonal membrane. Bathymodiolus marisindicus n. sp. resembles B. septemdierum and B. brevior from the western Pacific Ocean. However, it is distinguishable from these species by the height/length ratio, the length and strength of the ligament, the positions of the anterior retractor muscle scar and the anterior bundle scar of posterior byssal retractor muscle, the thickness of the pedal retractor muscle and by the shape of the intestine.

N2  - The activity patterns of 9 co-occurring species of molluscan grazers were observed on a gently sloping boulder shore at Amakusa, west Kyushu, Japan. Surveys on their activity were carried out four times in summer : twice during neap tides and twice during spring tides. Snails (Lunella coronata, Nerita japonica and Littorina brevicula) moving on the upper surface of the boulders were considered as 'active', and those not moving but staying on the surface as 'stationary'. With limpets (Nipponacmea concinna, N. nigrans, N. schrenckii, N. teramachii and Patelloida pygmaea) and chitons (Acanthochitona defilippi), all individuals on the upper surface of the boulders were considered as 'active', irrespective of whether they were moving or staying. Interspecific variations related to day/night and tidal conditions were recognized. Two species of snail, N. japonica and L. brevicula, were mainly active when 'emerged' (exposed to air) in the nighttime. Chitons and Nipponacmea limpets were active mainly when 'awash' (affected by wave action) and emerged in the nighttime. L. coronata and P. pygmaea were active in the nighttime irrespective of the tidal conditions. Relationships between the activity patterns and inorganic contents of faeces were observed ; 'limited activity species' (A. defilippi, Nipponacmea spp., L. brevicula and N. japonica), which are active mainly during the 'emerged' and 'awash' conditions in the nighttime, produce faeces of low inorganic content, while 'broad activity species' (P. pygmaea and L. coronata, including Monodonta labio), which are active in the nighttime irrespective of the tidal conditions, produce faeces of high inorganic content. Probably, the 'broad activity species' have more chance to ingest fine inorganic particles accumulated on the surface of boulders during their feeding excursions when submerged than the 'limited activity species'.

Active gametogenesis occurred in the period from July to October, during which three peaks of spawning were observed at intervals of about 45 days. Drastic declines in water temperature driven by the passing of typhoons were observed several times in the same period. However, the peaks of spawning did not correspond to physical disturbances caused by the passing of typhoons, nor to any particular lunar phase.

(O.) parvum, the testis is located to the right and the ovary is located to the left. P. casertanum has a paired gonad, with both testis located on the outer side and the ovaries located on the inner side. The number of nucleoli in mature oocytes and the shape of sperm heads of both species were different. Ovary activity of P. (O.) parvum increased twice a year in April and August, and testis activity was high in winter.

N2  - Vesicomya kawadai (Aoki) and Calyptogena sp. (Bivalvia : Vesicomyidae) were first obtained from the lower middle Miocene Higashibessho Formation in Toyama Prefecture. This is the oldest record of vesicomyids in the Japan Sea borderland. The Higashibessho Formation at the fossil locality consists of mudstone and alternating beds of sandstone and mudstone which deposited in the bathyal depths of the Hokuriku-Sanin-oki Trough. The deep-sea basin was formed by the early middle Miocene rapid subsidence in relation to the back-arc opening of the Japan Sea. Vesicomya kawadai (Aoki) first occurred from the lower Miocene of the Pacific side and invaded into the Japan Sea just after the formation of the deep-sea basin, maybe together with Calyptogena sp. Both species of vesicomyids may be formed a chemosynthetic community in the deep-sea basin of the Japan Sea.

N2  - Seasonal changes in the distribution and mating behavior of the potamidid snail Cerithidea rhizophorarum A. Adams, 1855 were investigated on a tidal flat in the Atago River, Kyushu, the most northern mangrove forest in the world. Two potamidid species, Cerithideopsilla djadjariensis (K. Martin, 1899), and Cerithideopsilla cingulata (Gmelin, 1791), and one batillarid species Batillaria multiformis (Lischke, 1869) co-occurred with C. rhizophorarum in this area. Newly-recruited juveniles (3-6 mm shell width) of C. rhizophorarum appeared from November to March. Adults of C. rhizophorarum were found in higher tidal zones than the other potamidid and batillarid species. The distribution of juveniles of C. rhizophorarum, however, was limited to lower tidal zones. Copulating behavior was observed at daytime low tide from June to August. Courtship behavior of C. rhizophorarum follows a fixed pattern. First, one animal (the initiator) approaches another and mounts its shell. If the lower animal (the acceptor) accepts the courtship, the upper animal (the initiator) inserts its soft body into the body of the lower animal. In about 80 % of copulatory pairs, the upper animals were male and the lower ones female. However, male to male copulation accounted for about 20 % of copulatory pairs. Copulation lasted for 11 to 74 minutes (mean : 20 minutes). Mating of C. rhizophorarum was random with respect to shell size.

Adams, 1850) from Jamaica revealed that the species should be reallocated to Neritilia Martens, 1879 (Neritopsina : Neritiliidae). The species is characterized by an inclined protoconch and a minute, neritiform teleoconch with a straight, edentulous inner lip, both features typical of Neritilia. Calceolata Iredale, 1918, the genus established for the present species, is therefore regarded as a junior synonym of Neritilia. The lectotype of Neritilia pusilla is herewith designated.

N2  - Activity patterns of the herbivorous gastropod, Monodonta labio, were observed in a single population on a gently sloping boulder shore at Amakusa, west Kyushu, Japan, in summer. Intraspecific variations of the activity patterns related to the level on the shore and the size of the snails were recognized. Snails were divided into three size classes : large (shell width>13 mm), intermediate (9-13 mm) and small (≦9 mm). Snails moving on the upper surface of the boulders were considered as 'active', while those not moving but staying on the surface as 'stationary'. The other snails, which were resting on the underside of the boulders, were not counted. In all the intertidal zones, many snails of all the three size classes were active during awash (affected by wave action) conditions both in the daytime and the nighttime and during the nighttime emerged (exposed to air) condition. In addition, the large snails were active when submerged in the nighttime in the mid and low intertidal zones. In the mid zone, the activity of the intermediate and small snails during the daytime awash condition tended to be lower than during the nighttime awash and emerged conditions. Some of the snails were stationary on the surface of the boulders while emerged during the nighttime. When emerged during the daytime, however, almost all the snails were inactive.

N2  - We studied population dynamics and life history traits of Siphonacmea oblongata living on seagrasses in Otsuchi Bay, the first record of this species from Honshu. Field census was conducted from October 1995 to November 1996 at intervals of 1-1.5 months. The limpet was collected quantitatively from both Zostera marina and Zostera caulescens patches in a single seagrass bed. S. oblongata undergoes benthic development, settling on seagrass leaves directly after developing in an egg-mass. The recruitment occurred from spring to early summer, while the previous-year class decreased during this period and totally disappeared in summer, indicating an annual lifespan for Siphonacmea. The density increased rapidly from May to June due to recruitment, remained high during summer, and drastically decreased from August to October. The increase in abundance occurred in accordance with the increase in seagrass biomass and high biomass of epiphytic microalgae in Z. marina patches. The dramatic decline of abundance from August to October may be caused primarily by food shortage because limpet growth became slow during this period as biomass of epiphytic microalgae decreased. The abundance of S. oblongata was significantly lower on Z. caulescens than Z. marina throughout the year. Recruitment rate was very low on Z. caulescens. The results indicate that S. oblongata prefers Z. marina as a habitat to Z. caulescens. The habitat preference may be related to the morphological characters of Z. marina, such as non-branching vegetative shoots dominating throughout the year, and its continuous vegetation pattern with high shoot densities. Seasonal variation in life history traits of S. oblongata also corresponds better to the phenology of Z. marina than Z. caulescens.

N2  - We studied the larval recruitment processes of the mytilid Musculista senhousia, by which benthic populations form and are maintained. We analyzed the processes based on the data for densities of different life stages (planktonic larvae, new settlers, and small to large bivalves) collected on the two tidal flats Kawaguchi and Nameishi (20 km apart) in the Ariake Sound for 2 years. Throughout 2 years observation, density of all stages was higher at Kawaguchi than at Nameishi except for large bivalves in 1998. We suggest that the higher density of large bivalves at Kawaguchi may be driven by a higher density of larvae.

N2  - Donacidae and Mesodesmatidae are bivalve families that characterize the intertidal zone of beaches in the Japanese Islands. Substrate preferences and burrowing ability were analyzed for all four species of Donacidae and five selected species of Mesodesmatidae that occur on the beaches of Southwest Japan from the Ryukyu Islands to Kyushu, Shikoku and western Honshu. Both families are generally similar in habitat and other ecological characteristics, but the Donacidae is adapted to relatively well-sorted substrate that can be easily fluidized and is favorable for quick burrowing mainly on dissipative beaches exposed to the open sea. On the other hand, members of the Mesodesmatidae inhabit generally more poorly-sorted, coarsergrained substrates of reflective beaches in bays or those sheltered by coral reef, which is unfavorable for quick burrowing. This relationship exists in both temperature or subtropical (Kyushu, Shikoku and Honshu) and tropical (Ryukyu Islands) regions. In temperate or subtropical regions, the donacids Chion semigranosus, Latona cuneata and Tentidonax kiusiuensis are common on very well to moderately well-sorted, medium sand of highly exposed to moderately exposed beaches, while Coecella chinensis and other mesodesmatids are abundant on moderately to poorly sorted, coarser-grained substrates of moderately sheltered to highly sheltered intertidal zones. In the tropical Ryukyu Islands, most of the beaches are sheltered by coral reefs, and the poorly-sorted coarse-grained substrates of such beaches are inhabited mainly by mesodesmatids such as Atactodea striata. Better-sorted sediments are inhabited by the donacids Latona faba and L. cuneata. Burrowing abilities measured by a Burrowing Rate Index, which normalizes burrowing time for a specimen mass, are consistent with these substrate and environmental preferences ; members of Donacidae burrow much faster than Mesodesmatidae in both temperate or subtropical and tropical regions.

N2  - Sulfur nutrition of gastropods and bivalves relevant to the mangrove ecosystem from central Sumatra, Indonesia was studied using stable isotopic signature (^<34>S/^<32>S ratios as commonly designated by δ^<34>S notation, per mil deviation relative to Canyon Diablo troilite, CDT). The mangroves (Rhizophora mucronata, R. apiculata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) assimilate light sulfur (^<32>S) (δ^<34>S=-14.4 to -6.2‰) from among sulfides in the substrate sediments (^<34>S=-20.3 to -11.9‰). The sulfides derive from the reduction of seawater sulfate by activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria under an ample supply of organic matter from mangrove trees. The gastropods (Terebralia palustris, T. sulcata and Telescopium sp.), which feed on the litter of the associated mangroves at low tide, have low δ^<34>S values ranging from -2.5 to +9.5‰ in their soft tissues. The present data indicates that of the sulfur assimilated by these species, 40-70‰ is derived from mangroves, with the remainder coming from sulfates in ambient seawater (δ^<34>S=+21‰), the absolute end-member of sulfur reservoir for marine organisms. The isotopic data provide an overall figure for sulfur nutrition that is difficult to estimate by conventional observation. The common bivalve (Anadara sp., δ^<34>S=+10.3‰) and a gastropod (Strombus (Euprotomus) aurisdianae, δ^<34>S=+14.4‰) obtained from areas of no vegetation in the peripheral regions of the mangrove forests also indicate assimilation of isotopically light sulfur. The isotopically light sulfur would be derived from mangrove leave litter as suspended detritus.

N2  - Assiminea japonica Martens, 1877 is commonly distributed in brackish waters in the Japanese main islands. Some local populations of the snail, however, have been reduced due to recent coastal developments. Distribution of the snail was surveyed along the Hinuma brackish water system and the size distributions of two local populations were monitored between May 1995 and January 1996. The snail was mainly distributed in reedy marshes and gravelly shores, but not on sandy shores or concrete banks. The snails inhabited brackish water where salinity was less than 8‰ and did not inhabit seawater or fresh water. Four shell color patterns were recognized. The ratio of the four shell color patterns within the population was different at every observation site. The snail widely occurred from intertidal to very shallow subtidal bottoms, but most snails did not migrate between these two bottoms during the tidal cycle. Seasonal changes in size composition in two snail populations were very different. A population in a reedy marsh was composed of adult snails throughout the year without recruitment, but a population on a gravelly shore was mainly composed of small juveniles.

Means of shell height, weight of whole body, and volume of whole body after hatching, respectively attained 52.2 mm, 25.6 g and 19 cm^3 after 12 months and 106.2 mm, 183.9 g, and 126.9 cm^3 after 23 months. The growth of Iwagaki oysters was affected by spawning, gonad development, low water temperature and possibly food availability inferred from the abundance of phytoplankton. Eleven shell characters : Total shell height, shell height, shell length, shell width, weight of whole body, soft tissue weight, weight of right valve, weight of left valve, volume of valves, volume of whole body, and volume of inner space were measured, and analysis was carried out to determine which characters best represent growth in whole body volume. The results showed that weight of the whole body and weight of the left valve were the most representative, but suggested that shell height was the most convenient for practical use.
