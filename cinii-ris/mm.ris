N2  - The Malaysian mole is far isolated population of genus Euroscaptor, described in 1940. Since the original description, the Malaysian mole has been placed as subspecies of Himalayan or Thailand species or synonym of the other species, and it has never been treated as a independent species. Recent results of the morphological, karyological and molecular phylogenetic researches assigned that the Malaysian mole is clearly distinct from other species of Euroscaptor. In this study, detail morphological characters of the Malaysian mole are redescribed. With the discussion of the history of the tea plantation of the mole's habitats in Peninsular Malaysia, the Malaysian mole is considered as a native species with distinct characters from other species of genus Euroscaptor.

N2  - Seven Asplenium normale individuals in Malaysia were surveyed for flavonoid compounds. They were divided into two chemotypes, H- and I-types. The flavonoids were isolated by various chromatography and identified by TLC, HPLC, UV spectroscopic, LC-MS and NMR surveys. Two flavone O-glycosides, apigenin 7-O-rhamnosyl-(1→4)-rhamnoside (1) and apigenin 7-O-rhamnosyl-(1→4)-rhamnoside-4'-O-rhamnoside (2), and two flavone C-glycosides, vicenin-2 (6) and lucenin-2 (7), were contained in one chemotype (H-type). On the other hand, two flavonol O-glycosides, kaempferol 3-O-glucosylrhamnoside (3) and kaempferol 3,4'-di-O-glycoside (4) and a flavone O-glycoside, genkwanin 4'-O-glucosyl-(1→3)-rhamnoside (5), were found from another chemotype (I-type) together with 6 and 7. In cases of Japanese Asplenium normale and related species, seven chemotypes have been reported. However, their chemotypes did not include flavonol O-glycosides and apigenin trirhamnoside. Apigenin 7-O-rhamnosyl-(1→4)-rhamnoside (1) and apigenin 7-O-rhamnosyl-(1→4)-rhamnoside-4'-O-rhamnoside (2) were reported in nature for the first time.

N2  - The Klitik Member of the Kalibeng Formation exposed along the Solo River in the Sonde area, East Java, Indonesia contains diverse molluscs that are a standard of the Neogene molluscan sequences in Indonesia vaguely dated as Late Pliocene. We investigated the molluscs and planktonic foraminifers in the Klitik Member exposed in a riverbank of the Solo River at Bangun, 2km west of Sonde, which is one of the four classical fossil-collecting sites in the Sonde area. Our faunal analysis of the molluscs demonstrated that the mollusc-bearing beds at Bangun were deposited in an intertidal to upper sublittoral zone under the influence of oceanic water. Three sediment samples from the Klitik Member contain abundant planktonic foraminifers, and the mollusc-bearing beds at Bangun are assigned to a time interval between 3.95Ma and 3.58Ma, the latest Early or earliest Late Pliocene. These results are important for the understanding of the molluscan faunal evolution in the Southest Asian archipelago.

N2  - Southeast Asia has a complex tectonic framework. The old craton, Indochina craton, is surrounded by Cenozoic accretional zone and magmatic arc. Many age data have been presented from the craton, though they have not been determined in a regional scale. We analyzed detrital monazites in the sands from the rivers cutting through the craton and surrounding younger terranes. Peaks in the age distribution of monazites from the Mekong and Sap Rivers are in ranges of 200-300Ma and 400-500Ma. In the other areas, major peaks are less than 300Ma. A small peak with 500-600Ma was recognized from the river running through Thailand. Such an old monazite is thought to be derived from the nearby sub-Indian continent at the time of Pangaea age. Monazite with 110Ma or younger peaks is due to the Cenozoic magmatic event at the time of subduction. The Triassic age, around 240Ma, is attributed to the breakup of the Pangaea or events related to the collision of Yangtze and North China cratons. The oldest peak, 450Ma, is a key age which should be present before the breakup event of the Pangaea. The age is not correlated with the age data of the India subcontinent, but is similar to that in the southern part of the Yangtze craton, suggesting that the Indochina craton was parentally formed with a part of the Yangtze craton.

We confirmed four specimens of Balaenoptera acutorostrata, seven of B. edeni, one of B. brydei, and ten of B. omurai, based on skeletal morphology. These results shed light to hitherto confused systematic understanding of so-called "Bryde's whales". Further studies of both morphological and molecular genetics on specimens, including the holotype specimen of B. edeni Anderson, 1879, are strongly expected for the thorough conclusions to be made. The specimen number of these species in institutions might reflect actual distribution density to some extent.

N2  - In order to investigate the effect of past climatic cycles on the latitudinal population structure in the Far East, we estimated the timing of genetic divergence between populations of Honshu and Taiwan in eight species of resident songbirds by the mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. The estimated divergence times were highly concentrated on two periods: 0.09-0.17 million years ago (MYA) for four species and 2.4-3.1 MYA for the other four species. The shallow divergence was synchronous with the last two glacial periods (0.01-0.20 MYA) in the late Pleistocene and the deep divergence with the late Pliocene. These results suggest that 1) a substantial level of gene flow is lacking between the two regions, Honshu and Taiwan, even in the species with no morphological differences at least in the present, probably throughout the Holocene, and 2) the latitudinal population structure of resident birds in the Far East should be affected by the two epochs, that is the last two glacial and the late Pliocene epochs. On the other hand, all the genetic signals that might have been accumulated during the early Pleistocene must have been eliminated during the last two glacial periods, due to the influence in the late Pleistocene stronger than that in the early Pleistocene. This is in striking contrast to longitudinal division of bird populations, of which previous genetic researches have not yet shown any marked influence of the late Pleistocene though it had been long suspected. Subspecies-groups of birds in the Far East likely diverged older than those in North America and a little older even compared with sister species pairs in North America. This might suggest morphological evolution is slower in the Far East than in North America.

N2  - The ability to discriminate conspecifics from heterospecific individuals may contribute to reproductive isolation among species. In birds, song is one of the most important cues in species recognition. We used playback experiments to investigate whether male Japanese Bush Warblers, Cettia diphone (Kittlitz, 1831), could distinguish the songs of conspecifics from those of the closely related Luzon Bush Warblers, C. seebohmi Ogilvie-Grant, 1894. Japanese Warbler males did not show statistically significant differences in their responses (i.e., the number of songs, rate of L-type song, number of flights, and time spent near the speaker) to song playbacks of the two species. This inability to discriminate between the songs may have been caused by greater costs to males when they misinterpret conspecific rivals for heterospecifics than the converse. In an additional experiment in the Philippines, male Luzon Bush Warblers responded more aggressively to conspecific songs than to heterospecific songs, although the sample size was small. The asymmetry in the results may yield due to the low density of the population in the Philippines, which could lead to less competition among males, although further investigations are needed.

N2  - An ophiotrichid ophiuroid Ophiocnemis marmorata (Lamarck) was found epizoic on a rhizostome jellyfish Rhopilema esculentum Kishinouye in Palawan Island, the Philippines, and in Kagoshima, Japan. Underwater observation at Palawan showed that one to several individuals of the ophiuroids cling to the oral arms below the bell of one jellyfish. The ophiuroid is widespread in Indo-West Pacific, but this is the first record from Japanese waters. This ophiuroid is usually found on soft substrates, but the association with rhizostome jellyfish has been previously reported by some workers. The association may possibly provide a means of dispersal.

N2  - The genus Rhynchaglaea from East and Southeast Asia is revised. The following nine species are discriminated: Rhynchaglaea scitula (Butler, 1879) distributed in Japan and Korea; R. perscitula Kobayashi & Owada, sp. nov. from Taiwan and Guangdong; R. labiscitula Kobayashi & Owada, sp. nov. from Taiwan and Vietnam; R. hemixantha hemixanthas Sugi, 1980 from Taiwan, Guangdong (new record), Guangxi (new record), and Vietnam (new record); R. fuscipennis Sugi, 1958 from Japan and Korea; R. taiwana Sugi, 1980 from Taiwan, Guangdong (new record), Guangxi (new record), Vietnam (new record), and Nepal; R. luteomixta Hreblay & Ronkay, 1998 from Taiwan, Guangdong (new record), and Guangxi (new record); R. terngjyi B. S. Chang, 1991 from Taiwan; and R. nanlingensis Owada & Wang, sp. nov. from Guangdong and Guangxi. Three allopatric sibling species groups are recognized, i.e., the scitula-perscitula and fuscipennis-taiwana groups, separated by the strait between the Ryukyus and Taiwan, and the terngjyi-nanlingensis group, which is separated by the Taiwan Channel and not distributed in Japan.

Two other species, Leptoplax varia Nierstrasz, 1905 and Acanthochitona biformis (Nierstrasz, 1905) originally described from the Philippines and Indonesian waters, were rediscovered after 100 years and are redescribed here with illustrations. Cryptoplax plana Ang, 1967 originally described from Puerto Galera is also redescribed with a more complete morphology. Callistochiton carpenterianus Kaas, 1956 is synonymized with C. granifer Hull, 1923.

These accessions were clearly divided into two groups based on the stem morphology and chromosome number: one is consisted of accessions from Japan, with alate stems and 2n=60; and the other group is consisted of accessions from Taiwan, with terete stems and 2n=30. This result supports clearly that "L. ardisioides" in question belongs to the different species from L. sikokiana as stated by Masamune (1932).

This new genus has very large shells and edentulous hinge plates, and is close to Anodontia and Meganodontia, but differs in having very thick shells, anteriorly more inclined umbones, and unique radially divergent ribs in the shell surface. The sedimentary facies and associated fossils reveal that B. obtusiplicatus sp. nov. lived in shallow marine, intertidal to subtidal environments.

N2  - Miocene megafossil floras in Taiwan are reviewed, and floral characteristics for the Shihti flora (Early Miocene) in the northern part of Taiwan and Lilongshan flora (Late Miocene) in the southern part are briefly discussed. In particular, the comparison is made with the Early to Middle Miocene floras from the Yaeyama Group in Yonaguni-jima and Iriomote-jima, southwestern end of Japan. The Shihti and Lilongshan floras, together with the flora from Yonaguni-jima, show the feature of oak-laurel forest in the warm-temperate to subtropical regions. The flora from Iriomote-jima is characterized by wetland and more temperate elements. These floras in Taiwan and Yonaguni-jima and Iriomote-jima in Japan provide evidence of Miocene floras in the lowlatitudes where little is known up to the present.

N2  - Stability and dissolution of heavy minerals were studied in the sandstones from the Western Foothills, Taiwan, where the continuous sequence from Miocene to Late Pleistocene develops. On the basis of modal proportions of heavy minerals in sandstones, it is concluded that many heavy minerals have been dissolved even in Late Pliocene sandstones. Stable minerals throughout the sequence are zircon, tourmaline, rutile, monazite, apatite and spinel. Ilmenite was dissolved in the Early Miocene sandstone. Dissolutions of aluminous silicates such as chloritoid, staurolite and Al_2SiO_5 polymorphs are observed in the Middle Miocene sandstones. Epidote, titanite and grossular-andradite garnet are more unstable minerals. Chemical analyses of detrital almandine garnets revealed that garnet with grossular component more than 10% was selectively dissolved in the Early Miocene sandstone. It is important for provenance study at first to recognize the selective dissolution of heavy minerals in the sandstones.

N2  - The avifauna of the Imperial Palace Area in Tokyo was monitored by bird censuses nearly in every two months from August 2000 to November 2005. The results were compared with the previous monthly bird census research from April 1996 to March 2000 reported by Nishiumi et al. (2000). The total number of species recorded in the 35 censuses since August 2000 was 64 species, which is composed of 20 residents, 17 winter visitors, 10 transients, and 17 irregular visitors as listed in Appendix 1, but no breeding summer visitors were recoded. In total of these 10 years, 78 species were recorded by censuses. Eleven species among them are newly recorded in this monitoring period since August 2000; Larus argentatus, Sterna sp., Cuculus poliocephalus, Anthus hodgsoni, Anthus spinoletta, Saxicola torquata, Cyanoptila cyanomelana, Terpsiphone atrocaudata, Parus montanus, Sitta europaea, Fringilla montifringilla. Apart from censuses additional 4 species were recorded; Ninox scutulata as a breeding summer visitor and Corvus corone, Fulica atra, Podiceps cristatus as irregular visitors. We found a significant decreasing trend in number of species observed in the bird census during these ten years. The number of individuals was also significantly decreased except for January and individual number of residents was conspicuously decreased, although that of winter visitors was stable or somewhat increased. Moreover, the species diversity showed significantly a decreasing trend in all of odd months.

N2  - The day roosts and foraging areas of the common Japanese pipistrelle bat, P. abramus, were investigated in the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, Japan. Since the six roosts are observed at Kikyo-mon Gate and Sakashita-mon Gate, we demonstrate that the pipistrelles often use the roost also within the Imperial Palace. The openings of the Japanese traditional roof tile may be suitable for the roost of bat in the Palace. The results of the line census point out that the pipistrelles do not use the whole area of the Imperial Palace, however, prefer the areas along the moats such as the regions near Kikyo and Ote Gates. From the track data of an individual with chemiluminescent tag, we conclude that the pipistrelle use the roots along the paved road and Hamaguri-bori Moat in the foraging areas. The findings indicate the nocturnal foraging activity in the Imperial Palace, and provide us with the fundamental data on the behavior of the common Japanese pipistrelle within the large city.

N2  - Six hundred and thirty-three moths in 46 families were collected in the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, ca. 115 ha. The survey was carried out from June 2000 to December 2005 by using a light, sugar bait and by ordinary day-time survey of adults and larvae. All the collecting data are given in the list, in which some noteworthy moths are commented in comparison with the records of such green tracts in the urban Tokyo as the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, 1996-2000 (Owada et al., 2000), the garden of the Institute for Nature Study, ca. 20 ha, 1998-2000 (Owada et al., 2001), the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, ca. 51 ha, 2002-2004 (Owada et al., 2005a) and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, ca. 2 ha, 2002-2004 (Owada et al., 2005b). The comparison of each result is shown in Tables 1 and 2. During a decade of survey period from 1996 to 2005, we observed the establishment and outbreak of a tortricid moth Cerace xanthocosma in the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, and the Akasaka Imperial Gardens (Owada et al., 2000, 2001, 2005a), and the details were summarized in the report of moths of the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo (Owada et al., 2005b). We became aware of the remarkable outbreak in the early spring of 2003, i. e., many nests made by the larvae of this tortricid moth were found on leaves of evergreen trees everywhere in the Imperial Palace and the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo. This moth is bivoltine in Tokyo urban forests, adults fly in June-July and September. The outbreak of adult moths was observed in 2003 and 2004, but ended rapidly in the winter of 2004, when hibernating larval nests were mostly disappeared in the Imperial Palace. In 2005, the density level of adult moths backed to that in 2001-2001, a few or no moths were observed in each investigation of its flight periods. We had found and bread larvae of this polyphagous moth on the following 17 evergreen broadleaved trees in 11 families. Araliaceae: Fatsia japonica; Aquifoliaceae: Ilex pedunculosa; Caprifoliaceae: Viburnum odoratissimum var. awabuki; Eericaceae: Pieris japonica; Euphorbiaceae: Daphniphyllum himalaense; Fagaceae: Castanopsis sieboldii, Lithocarpus edulis; Lardizabalaceae: Extauntonia hexaphylla; Lauraceae: Cinnamomum camphora, Cinnamomum japonicum, Machilus thunbergii; Myricaceae: Myrica rubra; Oleaceae: Lingustrum japonicum; Theaceae: Camellia japonica, Camellia sasanqua, Camellia sinensis, Cleyera japonica. Most of lithosiine moths, Arctiidae, are lichen and algae feeders, and usually very common in any forests and grasslands. In the 1970-1980's, air pollution was very serious in Japan, and lithosiine moths, except for marshy moths of Pelosia spp., might have become once extinct in the Tokyo urban areas. From the 1990's onwards, air pollution was eased to some extent, and the flora of lichens and bryophytes began to restore in forests of city areas of Tokyo (Kashiwadani & Thor, 2000; Kashiwadani et al., 2001; Higuchi, 2001). In fact, some lithosiine moths were collected in the Institute for Nature Study, the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa in 1998-2004, and they may already settle down in these forests. At the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, we were able to collect a female of Miltochrista abberans on 3 June, 2004, but we have collected none in 2005. It is quite likely that lithosiine moths will not settle down in the Imperial Palace grounds, which are the largest and richest the fauna and flora among large green tracts in urban Tokyo. This phenomenon may be one of the evidences of extinction of lithosiine moths in the urban Tokyo. There is a possible barrier, which obstructs the invasion of lithosiine moths to the Imperial Palace, that is, large moats completely surround the Palace. In larger moats, the longest width of water is ca. 100m, and is ca. 50m in smaller ones.

N2  - Forty-seven species of butterflies in 8 families were collected in the garden of the Imperial Palace, Tokyo from 2000 to 2005. They are 8 species of Papilionidae, 5 species of Pieridae, 12 species of Lycaenidae, 1 species of Libytheidae, 1 species of Danaidae, 10 species of Nymphalidae, 6 species of Satyridae and 4 species of Hesperiidae, and their seasonal and annual occurrence in the garden of the Imperial Palace are recorded. All the collection data are given in the list, in which some noteworty butterflies are commented. Many endangered butterflies in urban area of Tokyo are still survived in the garden of the Imperial Palace, that is, Atrophaneura alcinous alcinous and Papilio maackii, Papilionidae, Anthocharis scolymus, Pieridae, Narathura japonica japonica, Japonica lutea lutea, Japonica saepestriata, Antigius attilia attilia and Rapala arata, Lycaenidae, Sasakia charonda charonda, Nymphalidae, Lethe diana, Satyridae, and so on. A total of the records of our investigation from 1996-1999 (Hisai et al., 2000) and this survey, is 48 species. The butterfly fauna of the Imperial Palace is rich and very similar to such larger green tracts as the Institute for Nature Study (Hisai et al., 2001) and the Akasaka Imperial Gardens (Owada et al., 2005), central Tokyo.

N2  - In 2000 to 2003, the terrestrial staphylinoid fauna was quantitatively surveyed at nine stations (TK01-TK09) six times a year for each in the garden of the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, Japan. Each staphylinoid sample was extracted by Tullgren funnel from leaf litter and humus of five quadrats each sized 1m×1m. Sixty-two species of four families were recognized, 13 species of them being recorded for the first time from the Imperial Palace. Species diversity and similarity of six communities were analyzed by three diversity indices (Shanon-Weaner function H', Pielou's index of equitability J' and total diversity H'N) and three similarity indices (Jaccard's coefficient of community CC, Nomura-Simpson's coefficient NSC and Pianka's overlap index α). In the comparison of species diversity, TK03 was significantly low in H' and H'N and the other five were not different. In TK01 to TK03 surveyed in 2000-2001, the diversity was high in January to May, in a low level in July, and recovered in September; on the other hand, it decreased more or less in June to October in TK07 to TK09 (2002-2003). As to the similarity of species component, TK07 harbored many species completely covering the faunas of TK01, TK02 and TK03. A significant difference of TK09 in overlap similarity was indicated in an analysis by Pianka's α.

N2  - The air-floating beetle community was surveyed by flight intercept traps (FIT) for each of four stations in the garden of the Imperial Palace, the center of Tokyo, Japan. Three hundred and ninety-three species, 13,838 specimens in 61 families were collected in total, 45 species of which are going to be recorded from the Imperial Palace for the first time. The species diversities and their dynamics of the community of the superfamily Staphylinoidea and that of the other beetles were analysed by Estimates (Corwell, 2005), some diversity indices (Shanon-Wiener function H', J' and H'N), and similarity indices (Jaccard's CC, NSC, Pianka's α). As the result, the following three were pointed. 1) For one station the potential number of species (ICE) were estimated about 76 for Staphylinoidea and about 248 for the other beetles on average, however their percentages of clarification (Sobs/ICE) are low, about 70%. 2) The species diversity was generally high from March to July with large deviation, successively decreased in September, and very low in October to November. 3) Among the stations 1 to 4, the air-floating beetle fauna of St.4 was distinctly different from the other stations, probably because waterside beetle habitat was included only in St.4.

N2  - Monitoring investigations of the aculeate Hymenoptera, excluding ants, were made at the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, from 2001 to 2005. During this period, surveys were carried out almost every month except winter, December to February. A total of 116 species in 18 families were recorded. Similar research was made at the same place from 1997 to 1999, and 146 species of 20 families were recorded (Nambu & Shimizu, 2000; Terayama, 2000a). Twenty-three species were newly added in this survey, and a total of 170 species in 20 families were collected at the largest green tract in urban Tokyo during this decade. Bamboo shoot traps were set for tube renter wasps and bees, and 5 species made their nests: Anterhynchium flavomarginatum micado, Pararrhynchium ornatum, Trypoxylon malaisei, Trypoxylon errans and Megachile spissula.

Seventeen species are newly known from Central Tokyo and they are marked with double asteriks "**". As a result of the researches in this project, 119 tachinid species are recorded from the Imperial palace, Tokyo. It is interesting that an unidentified species of Setalunula was found there. It is most possible that this is the second species of this genus. Senometopia polyvalens was erroneously identified by Shima (2000). It is in reality an undescribed species of Senometopia. Phyllomya humilis reported by Shima (l.c.) should also be an undescribed species of the genus (P. sp.). Fausta inusta (Mesnil) was misidentified as Ernestia sp. Euvespivora sp. in Shima (l.c.) was comfirmed as E. decipiens (Walker).

N2  - After the publication of Tomokuni et al. (2000), a good number of the heteropterous insects were collected at the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, Japan, under the "Monitoring survey of fauna of the Imperial Palace, Tokyo" conducted by the National Science Museum, Tokyo. This paper reports these material along with a few additional specimens from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa left off the list of Tomokuni (2005). In total 49 species of Heteroptera were found from these three places including four newly recorded species: Apolygus pulchellus, Elasmucha putoni, Eurydema rugosa, and an undescribed species of Miridae (Japanese name, Okuro-kasumikame), all common in Kanto District around Tokyo. Of 49 species, Oncocephalus breviscutum, Cimicicapsus koreanus, and Eurystylus luteus are new to the Imperial Palace, Cletus punctiger is new to the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, and Sastragala esakii, Poecilocoris lewisi, Riptortus clavatus, and Rhopalus maculatus to the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa. These species are common in Kanto District as well. Cymus aurescens, found from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, has been unknown from the Imperial Palace. This may due to the lack of preferable host plants in the flora of the latter.

N2  - A total of 32 species out of 72 Japanese whiteflies (Aleyrodidae) have been recorded from the Tokyo Metropolis. In this occasion, we were allowed to survey and examine the white fly fauna of the Imperial Palace, the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo on the 21-22th of July, and the 3-4th of October in 2005. As a result, a total of 23 species were recorded, of which 19 species were derived from the Imperial Palace, 4 species from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, and 7 species from the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa. For the fauna of Tokyo, 5 species (Bemisia giffardi, Parabemisia maculata, Parabemisia myricae, Aleurocanthus spiniferus, and Aleurotrachelus taiwanus) were newly added, of which the species mentioned last was also the record new to Japan. These 23 species were divided into five groups of distribution pattern, the Japanese endemic (10 species), the Japan-China-Far East (2 spp.), the Japan-Taiwan (3 spp.), the Japan-Asia (2 spp.), and the World-wide (6 spp.). The species occupation rate of the Japanese endemic in these three Imperial districts is seemed to explain that the fauna of these districts represents the fauna of Tokyo, as well as that of Japan.

A total of 33 species belonging to 8 families were recorded. Similar research were carried out at the same place from 1996 to 2000, and 27 species in 8 families were recorded (Tomokuni & Saito, 2000). The following six species are recorded from the Imperial Place for the first time. Aeschnidae: Aeschnophlebia anisoptera Selys, Polycanthagyna melanictera (Selys), Anaciaeschna martini (Selys) (Fig. 30) and Anax nigrofasdatus nigrofasciatus Oguma (Fig. 31). Libellulidae: Libellula quadrimaculata asahinai Schmidt (Fig. 35) and Sympetrum kunckeli (Selys). Three endangered species in Tokyo urban areas, Ceriagrion nipponicum Asahina (Figs. 9-10), Trigomphus melampus (Selys) (Figs. 19-21) and Aeschnophlebia longistigma Selys (Figs. 27-29) were discovered by the former study (Tomokuni & Saito, 2000), and they are still abundant in the Palace. Rhyothemis fuliginosa Selys (Fig. 41), which had also been very scarce in the urban Tokyo, was gradually increase its number from 2002-2004, and we were able to observe its outbreak in the summer of 2005.

N2  - Spider specimens of about 1,750 in all were obtained during faunal researches in the Imperial Palace of Japan, which covers an area of 1,150,000 square meters in the center of Tokyo, in the period of 2001-2005. The spiders were collected from the gardens and around moats by sweeping and beating vegetations and sifting soil litter as well as by collecting with hands. A hundred and seventeen species were determined based on this material, including twenty species newly recorded to the fauna of the Imperial Palace. At the present 165 species of spiders are known in the Palace. The number of species reveals that the gardens fill an important role in a green tract of urban area in the center of Tokyo. However, results of an analysis on the species composition show that most of the species found are tough under urban environments by nature and can move well and migrate by ballooning. The fauna in the green tract of Tokyo generally resembles those in coastal areas of Kanto District and in the volcanic islands of Izu-Shichito in the common-species rate more than 70%. Species of larger linyphiids, scare theridiids and araneids, thomisids and salticids living on low vegetation, large spiders as Argiope amoena which require restricted prey insects, and lower active species in ballooning as coelotine spiders and Sinopoda forcipata are lacking in the Palace gardens. A plan to make special biotope to revive a rich fauna and species diversity with those spiders is proposed for the future horticulture and gardening in the Imperial Palace Gardens.

They are 49 species of 35 genera, viz. 10 species of 8 genera in the Protozoa (8 species of Rhizopoda, and 2 species of Chiliatea), 22 species (including variety and forma) of 12 genera in the Rotatoria, 1 species of the Gastrotricha, 1 species of the Nematoda, 15 species of 13 genera in the Arthropoda (13 species of Crustacea, and 2 species of Insecta). In 20 samples obtained in the previous survey, 81 species of 40 genera were recorded (Tanaka & Takeda, 2000), although the nematod worms and insect larvae were not examined. As a result, at present, the micro-organisms are known by a total of 130 species of 63 genera from four inside moats, Kami-dokan-bori, Naka-dokan-bori, Shimo-dokan-bori and Hasuike-bori, and from a small pond, Hisago-ike. Comparing the limnological fauna of the inside moats of the Imperial Palace of Japan with that of some ponds in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens in Tokyo recorded by Tanaka et al. (2005), it is definitely said that the inside moats of the Imperial Palace of Japan are still kept in good condition due to its large scale, though the Imperial Palace of Japan is surrounded by artificial buildings in Metropolitan Tokyo.

N2  - The survey project "Study on Environmental Changes in the Sagami Sea and Adjacent Coastal Area with Time Serial Comparison of Fauna and Flora" undertaken by the National Science Museum, Tokyo, was conducted from 2001 to 2005. The aim of this survey project was to describe the fauna and flora of Sagami Bay and its coastal area at the beginning of the 21st century. The marine fauna of Sagami Bay had been studied for over 110 years, from Ludwig H. P. Doderlein to the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, Tokyo. The floral survey along coasts of Sagami Bay and the Sagami Sea was originated in the U. S. North Pacific Exploring Expedition (1853-1854) and expanded by the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, Tokyo. National Science Museum, Tokyo succeeds these previous faunal and floral surveys in the modern Sagami Sea. The part of this project, the studies on living organisms and soil of coastal areas, were resulted in 17 papers in the present issue.

N2  - Two morphological types of Denticula kuetzingii Grunow are found from Japanese specimens in this study. The first type is found from Suzaki Peninsula and Izu-Oshima, Japan in this study. The individuals from Osousi-Spa (Tuji, 1995) and Yusenji-spa (Watanabe et al., 2005: as Denticula elegans) should belong to this type. This type has characteristic central broaden fibulae. The latter type is found from Yusenji-spa and Miyano-taki (Watanabe et al., 2005: as Denticula kuetzingii). This type has narrow central fibula which become lower to frustule ends. The length of frustule of this type is longer than first one. The iso-lectotype specimen in the Natural History Museum, London examined in this study, should belongs to this type. It is thought that both types may be other taxa. However, no clear differences were observed in SEM observations, thus both types are identified as D. kuetzingii var. kuetzingii in this study. D. kuetzingii has complex valvocopula such as septum-like plate (Gotoh, 1985) and thought to belong genus Denticula. However, this taxon has open band structure and similar to Nitzchia taxa, and it differ from other Denticula taxa which have half band structure.

N2  - The bryophyte flora of the coastal area of the Sagami Sea, central Japan, was investigated. About 980 specimens of bryophytes were collected from the area from 2001 to 2004. The bryophytes recognized comprise 32 families, 77 genera and 130 species of Musci, 26 families, 34 genera and 73 species of Hepaticae and 1 family, 2 genera and 3 species of Anthocerotae. For each species, substrata, localities and specimen numbers were given. The most rich bryophyte flora was found in Kamakura and Suzaki Peninsula where warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests are well preserved.

N2  - This study deals with the bryophyte flora of the Izu-Oshima Island, central Japan. The Izu-Oshima Island is located at about 110km southwest from Tokyo on the Sagami Sea, and it is the northern extremity of the Izu-Mariana Arc. The island has an active volcano, of which last eruption was occurred on 1986. The change of the bryophte flora in the island before and after the last eruption has been little known. About 450 specimens of bryophytes were collected from the island in 2004 and 2005. The bryophytes recognized comprise 24 families, 54 genera and 77 species of Musci, 24 families, 32 genera and 64 species of Hepaticae and 1 family, 2 genera and 3 species of Anthocerotae. Among them seventeen species of Musci and nine species of Hepaticae are newly found from the Izu Islands. Although most species listed in the present paper are distributed commonly around the Sagami Sea, the following species are remarkable in geography: Campylopus fragilis, Pylaisia nana, Frullania schensiana, Lophocolea horikawana, Marsupella minutissima, Diplophyllum andrewsii and Riccia nigrella.

N2  - The existing communities of Zostera marina (Zosteraceae) in the Sagami Sea were explored. Z. marina communities were found at 39 sites in Chiba Prefecture, 10 sites in Kanagawa Prefecture, and 2 sites in Shizuoka Prefecture. The high-density communities are seen in the areas from Kisarazu to Shirahama on the Boso Peninsula, and from Hashirimizu to Hayama on the Miura Peninsula. The northern part of Tokyo Bay and the northern and western shores of Sagami Bay are low-density areas. Many seedlings were found at Sanbanze, which is the only natural tideland in northern Tokyo Bay.

N2  - Phylogenetic relationships of Crepidiastrum platyphyllum to allied species and its distribution pattern were investigated in the present study. The phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) at nuclear suggests that C. platyphyllum cannot be treated as a variety of C. lanceolatum but should be given species rank. Herbarium surveys revealed the northernmost limit of C. platyphyllum was Ichinomiya, Chiba Prefecture; the southernmost limit in Honshu was Shimoda, Shizuoka Prefecture; and the southernmost limit in Japan was Tori-shima, Tokyo. The present field surveys suggest that the populations of C. platyphyllum recorded previously in Ichinomiya and Shimoda were probably extinct.

N2  - Flavonoids of three Heterotropa muramatsui varieties, var. muramatsui, var. shimodana and var. tamaense (Aristolochiaceae) were surveyed by HPLC and 2D-PC. One chalcone and six flavonols were isolated from the leaves and identified as chalcononaringenin 2', 4'-di-O-glucoside (chalcone, 1), kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside (2), kaempferol 3, 4'-di-O-glucoside (3), kaempferol 3-O-rhamnosylglucoside-4'-O-glucoside (4), quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (5), isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside (6) and isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside (7). Of their flavonoids, 3 and 4 were found from Heterotropa species for the first time. Flavonoid composition of three H. muramatsui varieties were apparently undistinguishable by HPLC and 2D-PC in this survey.

N2  - Cirsium hachijoense Nakai is taxonomically revised here. C. hachijoense is characterized by the absence of basal leaves at anthesis and having carnose, large, lower cauline leaves, fundamentally erect, large capitula, bowl-shaped to campanulate, large involucres and the chromosome number of 2n=4x=68. Capitula of this species frequently seem to be 'nodding'. This capitulum is supposed to be due to the declination of peduncle caused by the weight of the capitulum itself. C. hachijoense is endemic to the Izu Islands and has no relatives anywhere. A monotypic, new subsection of sect. Onotrophe (Cass.) DC., subsect. Izuinsulicola, is proposed for C. hachijoense.

N2  - Vegetation of Suzaki, Shimoda City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan was investigated from a chronological view point by remote sensing using satellite IKONOS and LANDSAT-TM data, physiognomical investigation on vegetations of whole Suzaki area, quadrat method of two forest areas in the Suzaki Imperial Villa, and interview to some persons living in Suzaki. The vegetation has been changed since 1970s, when a floristic investigation was carried out by the Emperor's Biological Laboratory in the Suzaki Imperial Villa. There were vegetations of paddy fields and grassy places as well as forest ones in 1970s. The forest vegetations have more luxuriated than 1970s and there are few areas of paddy fields and graasy places at present in and out of the Suzaki Imperial Villa. The largest areas of Suzaki are covered by broad-leaved forest and sea shore vegetations distributed along the coast at present.

N2  - Suzaki, Shimoda City is a small coastal area, approximately 3km×2.5km, which is located in the southern part of Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The natural environment of this area is preserved in good conditions; the vegetation is characterized by dense natural forests of evergreen broad-leaved trees and littoral plant communities along the sea shore. Vascular plant flora of Suzaki has been investigated since 2001 from two view points. One is chronological view point; the present flora is compared with that in 1980, when a book on the flora of Suzaki was published by the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, Tokyo. Another is taxonomy of littoral type taxa. Present study revealed that number of taxa distributed in Suzaki have increased and new littoral taxa are recognized. In the present study, 673 species, 13 subspecies, 106 varieties, and 26 formas (770 taxa) are included in 426 genera in 127 families of vascular plants. Those in 1980 are 577 species, 8 subspecies, 69 varieties and 20 formas (614 taxa) included in 375 genera in 116 families. During the course of the study, one species, 14 varieties, 13 formas, 3 hybrids were described as new taxa as well as 7 new combination of scientific names. Among these taxa, 18 are littoral type.

N2  - More than 26 species, including two new species, Hypocrea chrysofulva Doi and H. sagamiensis Doi, were found in the maritime, laurel forests along the Sagami Sea. A new species Hypocrea sagamiensis Doi, collected from the laurel forests in Jogasaki-kaigan coast and Cape Manatsuru-misaki, is close to Hypocrea cerebriformis Berk. Its stromata are mostly thick pezizoid, but often becoming cerebriform when stromata become larger and well-matured. Its anamorph belongs to the Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, aggr. Hypocrea chrysofulva Doi had been collected from the forests of Castanopsis sieboldii or Lithocarpus edulis in Tokyo. Because the distribution pattern of the species was somewhat unusual only found in the limited places in Tokyo. This species have been treated as nomen nudum. However, because the species has been found from the natural, laurel forests in the Jogasaki-kaigan coast, this species is described as a new species in this paper.

N2  - Allescheriella crocea (Basidiomycetous hyphomycetes) was reported from Sagami Bay Coast, central Japan, with description and figures. In Japan, the species was known to grow on the rotten bark of Machilus thunbergii in Kagoshima Prefecture (Oosumi Peninsula and Yakushima Island), but has not been rediscovered for long time and regarded as an endangered taxon. The present materials were also obtained from Machilus forests, situated at the northernmost point than its hitherto known distribution area. For the growth of the species in Japan, well preserved Machilus forests seems to be needed.

However, red soil was hardly distributed in adjacent area of the Sagami Sea, only in Suzaki, Shimoda City. The result of soil micro-morphological observation was as follows. It is not observed the clay coating of red soil of Suzaki, Shimoda. For comparison, red soil in Numazu City in Nishiizu was observed that had very clear clay coating. The past soil formation process in red soil of Suzaki, Shimoda was not able to interpreted by analyzing these data.

N2  - Spider specimens of about 950 in all were obtained during faunal researches under the project "Study on Environmental Changes in the Sagami Sea and Adjacent Coastal Area with Time Serial Comparison of Fauna and Flora, 2001-2005," made by the National Science Museum of Japan. These spiders were collected from the coastal areas of the Sagami Sea within the range of 34°40'-35°20'N, 138°40'-139°50'E, including sandy beaches and rocky shores, by sweeping and beating seaside vegetation, and sifting woods, rubbish and fucaceous seaweeds washed up by the sea on the beach. Many spiders were also collected by hands from all possible physical and biological environments. One hundred and nineteen species of 24 families were recorded based on this material, with notes on the species of the marine spider genus Paratheuma belonging to Desidae. Paratheuma insulana is newly recorded from Iou-torishima Island, Gushikawa-son, Okinawa Pref., Kita-kojima, Senkaku Islands, Ishigaki-shi, Okinawa Pref., and Chichijima Island, Ogasawara Islands, Tokyo, Japan, although it is not yet found in the present study area. Because this species was previously known from Cuba, Haiti, the Bermudas and the Florida Keys and other congeners are distributed in the western Pacific (Beatty & Berry, 1988), the strangely ditjunctive distribution of the species shows that the Japanese populations may be artificially imported from western North America. The coastal spider fauna of the Sagami Sea is analyzed based on the present material. Of the recorded species, 85% are the same as those recorded from gardens in urban areas in the center of Tokyo such as the Imperial Palace in Chiyoda-ku and Akasaka Imperial Gardens, and 75% are the same as those recorded from the volcanic islands of the Izu Islands, Tokyo. The result suggests most of the seaside-dwelling spiders have the adaptabily to severe environment under high temperature, dryness, erosion by rough seas and strong wind, and unreliable food supply.

As a whole, the isopod faunae of the region are allied to that of southern parts of Kanto District, but a few of subtropical elements such as Burmoniscus spp. are proved to be distributed in the Izu Islands. The dominant species of coastal forests were Armadillidium vulgare, Alloniscus balssi and Venzillo obscurus. As to the alien species from foreign counties, five species were confirmed not only in inland area but also from many islands.

N2  - Through a serial inventory survey from 2001 to 2005 in the coastal areas on the Sagami Sea, under a research program "Study on Environmental Changes in the Sagami Sea and Adjacent Coastal Area with Time Serial Comparison of Fauna and Flora" operated by the National Science Museum, Tokyo, a total of 176 species in 27 families of the hemipterous insects were found from coastal vegetation in the research area. Of these hemipterans, two species, Halovelia septentrionalis and Speovelia maritima, are marine or halophilic inhabitants, and 11 are considered to be littoral, viz. Blissus hirtulus, Peritrechus femoralis, Byrsinus varians, Aconurella orientalis, Exitianus nanus, Orosius oritentalis, Psammotettix maritimus, Takagiella tezuyae, Empoascanara alami, Stenocranus tateyamanus, and Himeunka tateyamella. Among them Peritrechus femoralis is particularly rare in the Japanese Lygaeidae and only a few localities have been known so far. The other 163 species are usually found in various habitats far from seaside, but the following 12 species were especially abundant in the coastal vegetation of this area: Nabis (Tropiconabis) kinbergii, Oncocephalus femoratus, Graptostethus servus, Geocoris proteus, Horridipamera inconspicua, Stigmatonotum geniculatum, Doratulina producta. Exitianus indicus, Motschulskyia serrata, Sogatella kolophon, Toya propinqua, and Unkanodes sapporonus. It is very likely that these species have high adaptability to various environments and can become dominant even in the littoral vegetation.

The aim of this survey project was to describe the fauna and flora of Sagami Bay and its coastal area at the beginning of the 21st century. The marine fauna of Sagami Bay had been studied for over 110 years, from Ludwig H. P. Doderlein to the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, Tokyo. The floral survey along coasts of Sagami Bay and the Sagami Sea was originated in the U. S. North Pacific Exploring Expedition (1853-1854) and expanded by the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, Tokyo. National Science Museum, Tokyo succeeds these previous faunal and floral surveys in the modern Sagami Sea. The part of this project, the studies on marine organism (arthropods-chordates), were resulted in 21 papers in the present issue.

N2  - Species of the hermit crab family Paguridae known from the Sagami Sea area, Pacific side of central Japan, are reviewed. The family is now represented by 53 species in 20 genera from the area. Points of uncertainties or problems in the taxonomy of some taxa are clarified. A neotype is designated for Catapagurus misakiensis, of which the holotype is presumably no longer extant, in order to stabilize the nomenclature. This action effectively makes C. japonicus a junior subjective synonym of C. misakiensis. Generic diagnosis of Pagurodofleinia is emended, because the diagnosis presented as Dofleinia by McLaughlin and Asakura (2004) and Asakura (2005) contains errors. Two species of Porcellanopagurus, P. japonicus and P. nihonkaiensis, are redescribed and illustrated in detail, because previous taxonomic accounts of these two species are insufficient and leave uncertainties about the detailed morphology. Keys to genera, separated by sex, presently known from Japanese waters, are provided. Brief notes on zoogeography are given.

N2  - A relatively rich fauna of stalked crinoids is distributed in the southern Japanese waters. Many species have wide distributions throughout the western Pacific, and the Japanese waters, especially the area from the mouth of Tokyo Bay and Suraga Bay through Kumanonada is regarded as the northern limit of many species. In Japanese waters, there are fourteen species of stalked crinoids, and five species are confirmed from the mouth of the Tokyo Bay, Suraga Bay, Enshunada and Kumanonada. This paper describes the distribution of stalked crinoids from the area as above based on the new records. Among western Pacific isocrinine species, taxa such as Saracrinus nobilis, Hypalocrinus naresianus and Endoxocrinus alternicirrus have wide distributions, whereas some species of Metacrinus, such as M. rotundus, M. interruptus and M. cyaneus, have relatively narrow, local distributions. Also the genus Metacrinus is the most diversified with many species, whereas Hypalocrinus and Endoxocrinus are represented by one and two species respectively in the Pacific. This contrasting species distribution, as well as species diversities among isocrinine genera might be due to their different reproductive strategies, as well as to their differences in bathymetric distributions.

N2  - To study the comatulid fauna of the Sagami Sea, sampling were performed for five years since 2001 mainly in eastern areas of the Sagami Sea and at 2 areas of Izu Islands. Then, a total of 213 lots of comatulid specimens from 68 localities were collected, namely about 193 specimens from 49 localities of the Sagami Sea and 672 specimens from 19 localities of Izu Islands. As a result of taxonomical study, these specimens were identified as 43 species of 10 families, i.e. 28 species from the Sagami Sea and 25 from Izu Islands including 4 and 14 new records respectively. As to the comatulid fauna of the Sagami Sea, a total of 62 species appeared in the Sagami Sea in addition to 58 former records and 4 new records from this study. This sum of species shows that the Sagami Sea is the richest area of comatulid crinoids in Japan.

In connection with our faunal study in the Sagami Sea, we compared the fish faunas of the following 12 sites under the influence of the Kuroshio Current: 1) Sagami Sea, 2) Osezaki (Suruga Bay), 3) Kushimoto (Kii Peninsula), 4) Kashiwa-jima Island (Shikoku), 5) Yaku-shima Island, 6) Okinawa-jima Island, 7) Ie-jima Island, 8) Miyako Islands, 9) Ishigaki-jima Island, 10) Iriomote-jima Island, 11) Hachijo-jima Island, and 12) Ogasawara Islands. Our zoogeographical analysis indicated that the 12 sites were divided into two groups, one including the five sites in the Ryukyu Islands and the other including the remaining seven sites. The latter group was subdivided into the Ogasawara Islands and the other six sites. The analysis strongly demonstrates a close relationship between fish faunas of the Sagami Sea and Osezaki (Suruga Bay). Our data indicate that the fish fauna of the Ogasawara Islands is more similar to those of the sites in the Pacific side of central Honshu and Shikoku, and Yaku-shima Island immediately south of Kyushu, although the Ogasawara Islands and the Ryukyu Islands are located in the same latitudinal zone. This suggests that the Kuroshio Current plays an important role not only in transporting coral-reef fishes from south to north but also forms a barrier for temperate fishes when they migrate south toward the Ryukyu Islands.

N2  - Fish specimens collected from the Sagami Sea from the 1870's to the 1920's and archived in the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, were examined and an annotated checklist of the species represented by these specimens is provided. The collection of the Sagami Sea fishes includes representative specimens of 152 species in 71 families belonging to 22 orders. This historic collection includes 100 type specimens and at least 734 specimens representing 99 species from the collections of the United States Fisheries Commission Steamer Albatross. The oldest specimens are an ophichthid, two carangids, a gobiid and a scombrid collected in 1878.

N2  - Marine mammalian residents or migrants in Sagami Bay and adjacent areas were investigated by year-around sighting surveys using an aircraft and a scientific research vessel. Unexpectedly, seven sighting surveys during a period between 2001 and 2005 could only find three pods of the Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens in early spring, which seemed to visit the Sagami Sea for feeding during their northbound migration. In contrast, wide varieties of cetaceans and pinnipedians have been stranded or incidentally caught along the coast of the Sagami Sea. Therefore, we concluded that there is no resident species of marine mammal in the study area but diverse marine mammals migrate seasonally or incidentally into the Sagami Sea.

N2  - The survey project "Study on Environmental Changes in the Sagami Sea and Adjacent Coastal Area with Time Serial Comparison of Fauna and Flora" undertaken by the National Science Museum, Tokyo, was conducted from 2001 to 2005. The aim of this survey project was to describe the fauna and flora of Sagami Bay and its coastal area at the beginning of the 21st century. The marine fauna of Sagami Bay had been studied for over 110 years, from Ludwig H. P. Doderlein to the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, Tokyo. The floral survey along coasts of Sagami Bay and the Sagami Sea was originated in the U. S. North Pacific Exploring Expedition (1853-1854) and expanded by the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, Tokyo. National Science Museum, Tokyo succeeds these previous faunal and floral surveys in the modern Sagami Sea. The part of this project, the studies on marine organism (brown algae and animals (Sponges-Annelids)), were resulted in 17 papers in the present issue.

Among them nineteen species (40.4%) were fucalean algae, while only three species (6.4%) were laminarean algae, and thus this algal flora was regarded as a warm temperate one. Elachista nigra, an epiphytic alga on Eisenia bicyclis, is a new record for Shizuoka Pref.

In this preliminary report, we compile the literature data of gorgonian coral species collected from Sagami-Bay and adjacent waters during 100 years, and show the species list from the project "Study on Environmental Changes in the Sagami Sea and Adjacent Coastal Area with Time Serial Comparison of Fauna and Flora" by National Science Museum, Tokyo during 2001-2005. Data Series include 397 specimens during this project. It has been recorded total 13 families and 115 species of gorgonian corals only in Sagami Bay and total 143 species in Sagami Bay and adjacent waters. All gorgonian species collected in Japan and adjacent waters composed with 223 species. By our compiled data, it was shown that more than half of whole Japanese recorded species were collected from Sagami Bay. In the literature, 25 species were only recorded from littoral (<200m) and 61 species were recorded from bathyal-abyssal (>200m). In our project, 294 specimens were collected from littoral (<200m) and 86 specimens were collected from bathyal-abyssal (>200m). It should be note that our project found that 12 first recorded species from the Sagami Sea and 5 first recorded species from Japanese waters. There is possibility to find more species and first recorded species from this area. Further research to re-check and revise Sagami Sea octocoral species is needed.

Rediscovery of the previously recorded species in the study area was limited to Trigonocryptus conus, Stephanostomum pagrosomi and Aponurus rhinoplagusiae. Helicometra pleurogrammi, Macvicaria isaitschikowi, Tubulovesicula lindbergi, Derogenes various and Gonocerca kobayashii were found, which have been recorded from colder water fishes in the higher latitude regions, while the tropical species was limited to Trigonocryptus conus. In addition, deep-sea species such like Neosteganoderma spp., Proctophantastes abyssorum, Dinosoma spp. Gonocerca phycidis and Lechithophyllum fuscum also occurred. The diversity and complexity of fish digenean fauna in the Sagami Sea was indicated.

N2  - Bryozoa collected by two research vessels and eight chartered fisher-boats from 2001 to 2003 from the shelf and slope zones of Sagami Bay were examined and preliminarily identified. Several undetermined species of Cyclostomata, no Ctenostoma, and 110 species of Cheilostomata belonging to 35 families are reported. Among the Cheilostomata, the most diversely represented families were the Candidae, Smittinidae, and Phidoloporidae. Sixty species (54%) were found at one station each, 37 species (34%) at 2-3 stations each, and 9 species (8%) at 4-5 stations each. Five species (4%) [Amastigia rudis, Steginoporella magnilabris, Cribrilaria radiata, Arthropoma cecilii, and Rhynchozoon sp.] were found at 6 to 8 stations each and can be considered as dominant bryozoan species in Sagami Bay. Because of difficulties with identification, a large proportion of bryozoans (42 species, or 38%) were identified only to the generic level; it is thus unclear how many species in the collection are new records for Sagami Bay. Undoubtedly some species of the genera Camptoplites, Porella, Smittina, Parasmittina, and Microporella, as well as most phidoloporids, represent new records for the area, or possibly species new to science.

N2  - A preliminary list of chitons from the Sagami Sea, the Pacific coast of central Honshu, Japan is presented. Occurrences of 50 species, belong to 23 genera in 10 families were confirmed from this area. Among those species, 8 species are regarded to be undescribed species, and 17 species are recorded for the first time from the Sagami Sea. Comparisons of the shallow water chiton fauna for four sites in this area revealed that species compositions are almost uniform throughout the Sagami Sea, however, southern areas yield slightly richer fanua because of the occurrences of some warm water species, which are distributed in southern Japan and/or tropical Indo West Pacific. There is no representative of cold water species living in the northern Honshu, Hokkaido and northwards, in the Sagami Sea except a single probable boreal species. Information on the chronological distribution of chitons in the Sagami Sea was given for about 90 years. Although the past records were insufficient for exact comaprison, many shallow-water species have been recorded throughout periods. Because chitons almost exclusively live in open water rocky shores, they are probably less affected by the environmental damage by coastal developments orpollution.

N2  - Shelled gastropods dredged from Sagami Bay by the R/V Rinkai-Maru of the University of Tokyo and collected with gill-nets by chartered fishing boats are examined taxonomically. More than 400 species are recognized, including those represented only by empty shells, and 390 are identified at least to generic level. 62 species (16%) are not identified to species level, and most of them are considered to be undescribed. 78 species (20%), including the unidentified species, are recorded for the first time in Sagami Bay. 250 species recorded in the previous study by Kuroda et al. (1971), which was carried out in the same area mainly by similar methods, are rerecorded here, but 140 (36%) are only in the present report. This is because the present survey paid special attention to minute species, which were mostly ignored in previous studies. More detailed surveys of the minute species will be necessary to catalog the gastropod fauna both of Sagami Bay and Japanese waters in general. In the present paper, following genera are recorded for the first time in Japanese waters: Melleria, Lissotesta, Aequispirella (Turbinidae); Pseudosetia, Amphirissoa (Rissoidae); Pseudocrisope (Elachisinidae); Brookesena (Mathildidae).

N2  - Among the benthos materials collected under the project "Study on Environmental Changes in the Sagami Sea and Adjacent Coastal Areas with Time Serial Comparison of Fauna and Flora" by the R/V Tansei-Maru, T/V Shin'yo-Maru and R/V Rinkai-Maru in the the Sagami Sea including Sagami Bay during the years 2002-2004, bivalves belonging to the Protobranchia and Anomalodesmata were investigated. Live specimens of both subcalsses were taken from 21 stations, 67-72 m at the shallowest, and 1415-1439 m at the deepest. Eleven species of protobranchiates and 13 anomalodesmatans were identified. Neither new species nor new record from this sea area was discovered. However, historical records of occurrences of every species were carefully reviewed to revise or to supplement to their distribution data in accordance with the objective of the project.

N2  - Cephalopod catches landed at the Miura Fishing Port in Sagami Bay were examined to determine the seasonal occurrence of cephalopods in the area. The bay is located on the Pacific coast of central Honshu (ca. 35°20'N,139°30'E) and has a broad bay area with a good circulation from the open water. Samples were collected weekly from March 1996 to December 2004 in six trap nets along the Miura Peninsula in the eastern part of the bay. A total of 40 species from 9 families were collected, and the seasonal occurrence was summarized for 32 species, excluding the 8 Octopodina species that were caught in low numbers. Species collected year-round included Sepia (Acanthosepion) lycidas, S. (Platysepia) esculenta, S. (Doratosepion) pardex, S. (D.) erostrata, S. (D.) tokioensis, S. (D.) sp., Euprymna berryi, Sepioteuthis lessoniana, Loligo (Photololigo) edulis, Todarodes pacificus and Ommastrephes bartramii. Species collected only in spring (March-May) included S. (D.) peterseni, S. (D.) kobiensis, S. (D.) misakiensis, Sepiellajaponica, Sepiadarium kochii and Onychoteuthis borealijaponica. Loliolus (Nipponololigo) japonica appeared from spring to summer (June-August), and Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis appeared only in summer. Species collected from summer to fall (September-November) included Enoploteuthis (Paraenoploteuthis) chuni, Thysanoteuthis rhombus, Eucleoteuthis luminosa and Chiroteuthis imperator. Sepia (D.) lorigera, S. (D.) appelloefi and Abralia (Heterabralia) andamanica appeared only in fall. Euprymna berryi and Loligo (Heterololigo) breekeri were collected through fall to spring. Watasenia scintillans and Moroteuthis loenbergi were collected only in winter (December-February). Onychoteuthis banksii was collected in winter and summer. Sepiids, sepiolids and loliginids that occure year-round and/or seasonally are considered to be neritic inhabitants and utilize coastal waters for feeding and/or reproduction. T. pacificus and O. bartrami are abundant in offshore waters, and some individuals pass through coastal waters during their north-south migrations. From summer to fall, the Kuroshio seldom flows into Sagami Bay that presumably transports subtropical and pelagic species such as E. (P.) chuni, C. imperator, T. rhombus and the two ommastrephids into coastal waters of the bay. From winter to spring, cold water flows from the Boso Peninsula presumably introduce mesopelagic species of W. scintillans and M. loenbergi in this region. The seasonal occurrence of cephalopods in trap nets along Miura Peninsula is associated with neritic cephalopods fauna in this region as well as large-scaled seasonal changes in circulation in Sagami Bay.

N2  - The avifauna of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo, was investigated by monthly bird censuses from April 2002 to March 2004. Forty-six species were recorded in the censuses. We newly recorded three species: Water Pipit Anthus spinoletta, Red-breasted Flycatcher Ficedula parva, and Brambling Fringilla montifringilla. Both number of species and that of individuals increased during winter and decreased during breeding seasons. The species diversity also showed similar seasonal changes. These results suggest that the Akasaka Imperial Gardens is an important wintering habitat for birds. In comparison with census data in other large gardens in Tokyo, the avifauna of the Gardens was not different from that of the Institute for Nature Study, but had lower species diversity than that of the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, possibly because the Palace has larger area including large ponds. Using census data between 1986 and 2001 in a previous study, we did not find correlation between number of species and year. Twelve species that had been recorded from 1965 to 1967 were not found in the recent censuses. This may be caused by the environmental change in large scale, i.e. the development of Tokyo, and the habitat destruction in the wintering area for summer visitors.

N2  - We conducted a survey for one year to evaluate the bird population on the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa which is located in the heart of Tokyo. We assessed the number of species and each species population, the greened area, the number of surrounding greened areas, the distance from these greened areas and also surveyed the degree of diversity of the bird species. We compared these results with those of Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden and the Imperial Palace Tokyo. The line census method was performed 12 times. There were 24 bird species with a total of 605 birds. Also a fixed census was performed the same times and another 5 bird species were recorded. According to this census, the total number of bird species recorded on the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa bounded 47, though it was not used for the analysis. The most number of bird species (13) were recorded during the winter (December) and the least number (7) was recorded during the breeding season (August). The most number of birds (76) was recorded in October and the least was in August (25). Five of the most common birds in the city had the highest population. The population of each species was: Brown-eared Bulbul Hypsipetes amaurotis (124), Tree Sparrow Passer montanus (116), Great TitParus major (74). Although we could not find a large difference, compared with 2 other greened areas, the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa was the smallest in size. These greens and that of the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa are both smaller than the surrounding greens. When comparing the average distances between these greened areas, there was no significant difference. However, the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa is the furthest. The largest population of birds at one time was recorded during the winter (January 3) (34) and the last were during the breeding season (June 2) (1). Even though the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa in the heart of the city is small, it has many bird species and the population of these species is high. This is a very unique greened area. It appears that Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, in the heart of the city, is a very important area for wintering migrants and resident birds. Also from the census data it appears that this greened area is a staging area for migrating birds.

N2  - On the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, we examined the fecal pile sites by using the sensor cameras and the food habits by analyzing the fecal contents. We confirmed ten fecal pile sites in the Gardens and took totally 191 photographs of the raccoon dogs in the sites. Each individual was similar in external appearance, and the mange was not observed in the photographs. From the photograph data, we suggest that the animal may also use the fecal pile sites as feeding areas. The seasonal changes of use frequency were demonstrated in some sites. The raccoon dogs were fairly active in both daytime and night time during the period of the examinations. The raccoon dogs mainly fed on insects, fruits, myriapods and small birds. Seasonal change of food habits was indicated and the coprophagous and coprophilic insects were exclusively confirmed in colder season. We suggest that the raccoon dogs may maintain the fecal piles to secure foods in sites in winter.

N2  - Four hundred and sixty-three species of moths in 45 families and 31 species of butterflies in 7 families were collected in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, ca. 51 ha in area, central Tokyo. The survey was carried out from 2002 to 2004 by using a light, sugar bait and a Malaise traps and by ordinary day-time collectings of adults and larvae. All the collecting data are given in the list, in which some noteworthy moths and butterflies are commented in comparison with the records at the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, 1996-2000 (Owada et al., 2000) and of the garden of the Institute for Nature Study, Tokyo, 1998-2000 (Owada et al., 2001) (Table 2). Two larvae of Epiponponia nawai, an external parasite of cicadas, were discovered on the body of a male Meimuna opalifera (Fig. 5). It is worth noting that this ecologically interesting moth still survives in a large green tract of the urban centre of Tokyo. As was already pointed out by Owada et al. (2000, 2001), such larger moths as the Drepanidae, Lasiopampidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae, Notodontidae and Arctiidae, are endangered or extinct in the city area of Tokyo. The largest moth, still surviving in Tokyo, isActias artemis, Saturniidae, which was discovered not only in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens but also in Shinjuku, near NSMT, and Setagaya in 2004. In the early 1950's, 14 species of notodontid moths were recorded in the garden of the Institute for Nature Study, Tokyo (Monbusho National Institute for Nature Study, 1952). On the contrary, five species were discovered in the Imperial Palace (Owada et al., 2000), two in the Institute for Nature Study (Owada et al., 2001), and four in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens in this study. The total number of species collected in those surveys is seven, in which four species, Phalelodonta manleyi, Ptilophora nohirae, Lophontosia pryeri and Micromelalopha troglodita, were not listed the 1950's survey. These moths would have inhabited the urban area of Tokyo in those days, because the former two species fly only in the winter season, and the latter two is also common in the suburb of Tokyo. In these 50 years, the following 11 notodontid species are considered to have become extinct from large green tracts of the Tokyo city area: Stauropus fagi, Rabtala cristata, Fentonia ocypete, Harpyia umbrosa, Pterostoma sinicum, Neostauropus basalis, Eguria ornate, Shaka atrovittatus, Tarsolepisjaponica, Phalera angustipennis and Mimopydna pallida. On the other hand, diversity of winter moths in the Akasaka Imperial Palace and the Imperial Place Gardens, Tokyo, is retained at a level as high as on the hills of the suburbs of Tokyo, 11 geometrid and 22 noctuid species. These moths are rather few in the Institute for Nature Study, only 4 geometrid and 5 noctuid species. In the winter season, such predators of moths as birds and reptiles are scarce and it is not a breeding period for them. Their activity of predation will be very low in the winter, and those moths have rather weak photoactivity, especially in noctuids. It is worth noting that larvae of most winter moths are polyphagous on broadleaved trees, while most of the extinct notodontid moths are oligophagous. It should be stressed that the host plants of those extinct notodontids are now abundant in these large green tracts in Tokyo. The butterfly fauna of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens is rich and very similar to those of the Imperial Palace and the Institute for Nature Study, Tokyo.

N2  - One hundred and fifty-nine species of moths in 29 families were collected in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, ca. 2 ha in area, central Tokyo. The survey was carried out from 2002 to 2004 by using a light and a Malaise traps and by ordinary day-time collectings of adults and larvae. Of these moths, 69 species, 44%, are recorded from the Imperial Palace, Tokyo (Owada et al., 2000), the garden of the Institute for Nature Study, Tokyo (Owada et al., 2001) and the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo (Owada et al., 2005), and 15 species, 9%, are not recorded from the other research sites. The Malaise trap was quite useful for researches of moths for the small restricted forest at bright nights of the urban centre of Tokyo, though intercepted moths were wet by ethanol liquid. The trap was set in a forest bed of evergreen broadleaved trees. The most dominant moth is Synegia esther, Geometridae, 152 exs., and succeeding moths are: Gynaephila maculifera, Noctuidae, 58 exs., Endotricha olivacealis, Pyralidae, 54 exs, Zanclognatha culvilinea, Noctuidae. 47 exs., Hydrillodes lentalis, Noctuidae, 33 exs., Amata fortunei, Arctiidae, 29 exs., Simplicia xanthoma, Noctuidae, 25 exs., Orthosia fausta, Noctuidae, 17 exs., and Diarsia deparca, Noctuidae, 15 exs. Larvae of the dominant geometrid moth, Synegia esther, feed on Ilex spp., Aquifoliaceae, which are planted abundantly in gardens of temperate Japan. Other dominant species, Gynaephila maculifera, Endotricha olivacealis, Zanclognatha culvilinea, Hydrillodes lentalis, Noctuidae, Simplicia xanthoma, Noctuidae, are dead leaf feeders or scavengers. It is worth noting that many moths of Amata fortunei were trapped; what is the reason why the open land flyers entered into a dark forest bed of evergreen trees? This phenomenon seems to suggest an unknown behavior of A. fortunei. As was pointed out by the former report (Owada et al., 2005), many notodontid moths were extinct from large green tracts of the Tokyo urban area. Only one notodontid moth, Torigea straminea, a bamboo grass feeder, still survives in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo. In such a large residence with gardens as the Villa, bamboo grasses, e.g., Sasa, Pleioblastus, Phyllostachys, etc., are used to be planted for landscape, and T. straminea may be able to survive on those colonies. Establishment of Cerace xanthocasma, Tortrocidae, in the large green tracts of Tokyo was analysed by the series of our researches (Owada et al., 2000, 2001, 2005). The first moth (a female) was discovered from the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, in 1997, a few larvae were collected in the same tract and the garden of the Institute for Nature Study, Tokyo in 1999, and the discovery of adults and larvae was gradually increased from 2000 to 2002. In the spring of 2003, many nests made by the larvae of this tortricid moth were found on leaves of evergreen trees everywhere in the Imperial Palace and the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo, and the outbreak of moths occurred in July. In 2004, hibernating larvae were also found abundantly, but the occurrence of moths was not so abundant as in 2003. On the contrary, since we were able to find out only one nest of C. xanthocosma in the garden of the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa in the spring of 2004, this moth does not yet settle down in whole areas of Tokyo.

N2  - Twenty species of butterflies were observed or collected at the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa (ca. 2 ha, in area), central Tokyo, in 2003 and 2004: 3 species of Hesperiidae, 4 species of Papilionidae, 3 species of Pieridae, 4 species of Lycaenidae, 4 species of Nymphalidae and 2 species of Satyridae. In the 1980's, one of the authors, Prince Masahito, had once observed 4 other species of butterflies, Papilio bianor dehaanii, Artogeia melete, Argynnis paphia tsushimana and Yptima argus argus, which were not found in the present research. Therefore, 24 species of butterflies were found in these 25 years. It can be surmised that Artogeia melete and Yptima argus argus are extinct and Lycaena phlaeas daimio is endangered in this area. Palilio bianor dehaanii will still inhabit this area, and Argynnis paphia tsushimana is an accidental visitor in the garden. The number of butterfly species in this garden was fewer in comparison with other larger green tracts in urban central Tokyo, the Imperial Palace (Hisai et al., 2000), the Institute for Nature Study (Hisai & Yano, 2001), and the Akasaka Imperial Gardens (Yoshida & Ando, 2002; Owada et al., 2005), because of the small size of the garden and the lack of a large open land in the Villa. The discovery of Potanthusf. flavus, a "sasa", Gramineae, feeder, and Lycaena phlaeas daimio, an openland inhabitant, is, however, remarkable. These 2 species of butterflies are decreasing rapidly in the Institute for Nature Study.

N2  - In the faunistic survey carried out from 2002 to 2003, 34 staphylinoid species in four families were collected from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Minato-ku, Tokyo, and 25 species in four families were recognized in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo. Soil staphylinoid faunas of Akasaka, Tokiwamatsu, Fukiage Garden of the Imperial Palace (Nomura, Kishimoto & Watanabe, 2000), and the Institute for Nature Study, National Science Museum (Nomura & Kishimoto, 2001) were compared to one another by Jaccard's coefficient of community (CC) and Nomura & Simpson's coefficient (NSC). The affinity between the Imperial Palace and the Institute for Nature Study is low. The fauna of Akasaka is closely allied to that of the Imperial Palace with 80% of common species. Soil staphylinoid communities at twelve sites in Akasaka and four sites of Tokiwamatsu were quantitatively sampled, and analyzed using three kinds of diversity indices (H', J' and H'N). The difference in average diversity index (Shannon function:H') was not significant, but the relative diversity index (Pielou'sJ') was slightly high in Akasaka.

N2  - The soil curculionoid faunas of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Minato-ku, Tokyo and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, are surveyed in 2002-2004. Twenty-five species in two families were recorded in Akasaka, and twelve curculionid species were found from Tokiwamatsu. The soil curculionoid fauna of Akasaka is larger than that (22 spp.) of Fukiage Garden of the Imperial Palace, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo (Nomura et al., 2000). The diversity and affinity of the soil curculionoid communities in twelve sites of Akasaka and four sites of Tokiwamatsu are quantitatively sampled and analyzed in the same methods as for staphylinoids (Nomura et al., 2005). As the result, average diversity index (H': Shanon-Wiener function) is slightly greater in Akasaka than in Tokiwamatsu in spite of that the total diversity (H'N) is distinctly greater in Tokiwamatsu, and the relative diversity (J') is much greater in Akasaka. The community structure of Tokiwamatsu is clearly considered to be less complicated and less diversified than that of Akasaka.

N2  - As the result of the faunistic survey in 2002-2004, 353 species in 59 families of the order Coleoptera were discovered from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Minato-ku, Tokyo, and 143 species in 36 families were collected in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo. The number of species is relatively small in Akasaka (ca. 51 ha) for its size in comparison with the garden of the Imperial Palace (73 families, 738 species) reported by Nomura et al. (2000), and that of Tokiwamatsu is rather large for the small size (ca. 2 ha). The high diversity of beetles in Tokiwamatsu is probably caused by an edge effect. The faunas of Akasaka, Tokiwamatsu and the Imperial Palace are closely allied to one another with high Nomura & Simpson's coefficiency index (NSC) around 75%. The beetle faunas of Akasaka and Tokiwamatsu differ from that of the Imperial Palace in including some different species of xylophagous species in the families Elateridae, Anobidae and Curculionidae (Scolytinae) and some unique species to agricultural field and the surrounding forest, namely, Chilocorus rubidus (Akasaka: Ak below), Rodolia cardinalis (Tokiwamatsu: To below), Epirachna vigintioctopunctata (To), Lagria rufipennis (Ak, To), Massicus raddei (Ak), Oberea japonica (Ak), Aulacophora femoralis (Ak), Cryptocephalus scitulus (To), Euops (Synaptops} splendus (Ak), Pseudocneorhinus bifasciatus (Ak), Curculio sikkimensis (Ak). Some species invaded from foreign countries which have not been known from the Imperial Palace were discovered in the areas concerned, namely, Ptosima chinensis (Ak), Rodolia cardinalis (To), Stegobiumpaniceum (To), Silvanus lewisil (Ak, To), and Hypera postica (Ak).

N2  - A total of 51 species of sawflies and woodwasps collected in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo, are listed with collection data, distributional range and known host plants for each species. They are one species of Xyelidae, one species of Siricidae, four species of Argidae, and 45 species of Tenthredinidae. Eleven species of the Tenthredinidae have been determined only to genera or questionably determined to species. In addition to these, a long series of specimens of the tenthredinid genus Pachyprotasis were collected but not determined to species. All the 51 species, with the exception of a nematine, Trichiocampus pruni Takeuchi, 1956, were found in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, whereas two species of Argidae and ten species of Tenthredinidae were found in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa. Five tenthredinid sawflies, namely, Loderus eversmanni obscurus (Marlatt, 1898), Nesoselandria ventralis Takeuchi, 1941, Caliroa zelkovae Oishi, 1961, Eutomostethus lubricus Seiyama, 1981, and Zaphymatocera nipponica Togashi, 1984, are newly recorded from Tokyo. The species composition of sawflies and woodwasps of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa has much in common with that of the Imperial Palace and the Gardens of the Institute for Nature Study, Tokyo.

Thirty-five species belonging to 22 genera are recorded: three species in the subfamily Ponerinae, three species in Proceratiinae, 17 species in Myrmicinae, one species in Dolichoderinae, and 11 species in Formicinae. Compared with other areas in the metropolis of Tokyo, the Akasaka Imperial Gardens has larger number of ant species. The high species richness of ants in this area is due to the presence of many arboreal and leaf litter living species.

A total of 117 species belonging to 17 families were recorded. Nambu and Shimizu (2000) and Terayama (2000) recorded 145 species from the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, 1996-2000, and 20 species recorded from this research were not collected at the Imperial Palace. A Malaise trap was set during one year, and 44 species (ca. 37.6%) were captured only by the trap. It is worth noting that 361 examples of 3 species of the genus Cleptes were intercepted by the trap, though I could collect one female of C. satoi in 2.5 years.

The larvae of these species are known to live gregariously in soil humus. Bibio rufiventris is distributed in Tokyo and its adjoining Prefectures (Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba), and seems a common species at least in central Japan. Above four species are also recorded from a small forest in Yokohama city, Kanagawa Prefecture. Therefore, this species composition may be characteristic for a small fragmented forest in the urban area of Tokyo.

N2  - Ten species were identified for phorid flies collected at the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo. Most of the species seemed to be common in Japan, but two of them were remarkable. Peromitra fimbriata was described as new to science from mountainous region in Kyushu, Japan, based on a few male specimens (Nakayama & Shima, 2002). Discovery of this species in Tokyo, low altitude in cental Japan, is interesting. Another species, Anticofimbria orientis, is the type species of the monotypic genus Anticofimbria which was described by Schmitz (1951) based on a male specimen caught in Tokyo on 18 June, 1950 by Prof. Max v. Kiienburg. Anticofimbria orientis has never been caught again since the first male specimen. Many males and some females of this species were caught by a Malaise trap in this survey. Anticofimbria orientis has long strong bristles on the anepisternum and lacks wing vein Ra+s in both sexes. It was confirmed that the genus Anticofimbria was different from the genus Apocephalus, from these characters. The genitalia and proboscis of the female of A. orientis were asymmetric in structure (Fig. 1).

N2  - Fruit flies collected at the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo, and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, during April 2002-April 2004, were listed. A total of 90 specimens were captured by Malaise traps (MT) and sweepings (SW). These were assigned to 18 species of two subfamilies, Tephritinae and Trypetinae. Among them, Euphranta sp. was noted taxonomically. It is similar to E. jucunda (Hendel, 1915) and E. japonica Ito, 1947 in wing marking pattern (Fig. 1), but different from them by wing marking expanded from apices of the wing cells r_<2+3> to m separate from wing markings on apex of the wing cell ri and the crossvein dM-Cu. Euphranta sp. also has yellow abdomen, with dark brown markings on anterior margin of the abodominal tergites, while E. japonica has entirely dark brownish abdomen. All 18 species of tephritid flies examined here are common to adjacent regions in Kanto Distinct, but E. camelliae Ito, 1949, E. japonica, Acrotaeniostola scutellata (Matsumura, 1916), Hemilea infuscata Hering, 1937, and Vidalia accola (Hardy, 1973) were recorded from the Tokyo Metropolis for the first time.

N2  - Drosophilid flies were sampled in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, using a Malaise Trap operated continuously between 11 October 2002 and 14 October 2003 in Akasaka, and between 26 July 2002 and 19 August 2003 in Tokiwamatsu. These collections in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens were supplemented by some field works using an insect net. A total of 57 drosophilid species were recorded in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, but surveys carried out in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa recorded 13 drosophilid species. All species collected in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa were collected in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, too. All drosophilid species collected at both areas were listed. The drosophilid fauna at the Akasaka Imperial Gardens was compared with that of the Imperial Palace grounds, Tokyo (Beppu, 2000). Numbers of drosophilid species belonging to three genera (Amiota, Hirtodrosophila and Drosophila) in the Akasaka is smaller than those in the Imperial Palace grounds. Trap collections baited with fermenting bananas were not made in the survey of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, and this seemed to be the reason for the absence of many species belonging to the genus Drosophila in Akasaka. Furthermore, sweeping collections for drosophilid flies could not be done so often in Akasaka. The absence of some species belonging to Amiota or Hirtodrosophila in Akasaka seemed to be due to insufficient sweeping collections, because they had been collected by this method. These suggest that the number of drosophilid species found in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens will increase with more extensive trap and sweeping collections for various materials, and the drosophilid representations of the two areas, the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Imperial Palace grounds, will be very similar.

N2  - The faunas of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo, Japan were investigated from 2002 to 2003 by the National Science Museum, Tokyo. As the result, 3,469 specimens of the family Fanniidae from the former and 182 specimens from the latter were collected mainly by Malaise traps, including nine species: Fannia edentula, F. fulgida, F. imperatoria, F. japonicajaponica, F. prisca, F. pusio, F. shinahamae, F. urbana and F. vernalis. Two of them, F. imperatoria and F. urbana were described as the result of the investigation at the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, from 1996 to 2000. Fannia prisca and F. pusio are the synanthropic species, while the other species are the inhabitants of the forests of the hilly zone (0-700 m above sea level). Eight species except F. prisca were collected from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and seven species except F. pusio and F. urbana were enumerated from the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa. The ecological environments of these areas are well reserved, because many inhabitants of the forests live there. The faunas of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa are similar, and both are also similar to the result of the faunistic investigation at the Imperial Palace, Tokyo (Nishida, 2000). From the Rokko Mountains, Kobe, one of the typical hilly zones in Japan, one synanthropic species, F. scalaris and ten inhabitants of forests (including F. fuscitibia and F. maculosa) are listed. F. scalaris lives in forests, where wild boars are abundant, because it is reared from the dung. F. fuscitibia and F. maculosa live in not only hilly zone, but also the mountain zone (700-1,700m). Although 17 species are listed throughout the hilly zone of middle Japan, usually some ten species live in the individual habitat. The number of the species in the results of this investigation and the Imperial Palace are slightly fewer than the Rokko Mountains that are distant range of the low mountains and hills. From the viewpoint of the faunistic feature, most species from the Akasaka Imperial Garden and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa are the inhabitants of the woods in the plains and low hills. It is notable that an exotic species, F. pusio is collected from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens. This species is native to the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, and is widely spread in tropical and worm temperate zones of the Old World. In Japan, it was recorded only from the megalopolis like as Tokyo and Kobe in recent years. It can be surmised that this is a sign of a tendency to worming up in Japanese urban areas.

Eighteen genera and 38 species of Muscidae, 10 genera and 14 species of Calliphoridae, 3 genera and 14 species of Sarcophagidae are recorded in this paper. Most of the species collected are common with the fauna of the gardens of the Imperial Palace, Tokyo (Shinonaga, 2000), and the Institute for Natural Study, Tokyo (Shinonaga, 2001).

N2  - Seventy two species of tachinid flies are recorded from the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo, and eight species from the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa. No dexiine and phasiinine species were obtained in these areas. Fifty three species of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens are common to those of the Imperial Palace, Tokyo, reported by Shima (2000). It is considered that some 110 species totally reported from both areas are fundamental numbers of tachinid species in central Tokyo.

N2  - As a part of three-year inventory research project "Fauna of the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo" conducted by the National Science Museum, Tokyo, a total of 80 species of the Heteroptera in 23 families are recorded from the research areas. The Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa are located in the center of Tokyo Metropolis several kilometers southwest of the Imperial Palace. Although these areas are now surrounded by highly urbanized environment, well-preserved vegetations still remain there. Since the Garden and the Villa have strictly been protected as the special precincts belonging to the Imperial Household, the fauna in the areas has quite poorly been investigated up to the present. This is the first report on the heteropterous fauna of the areas. The number of species from the Garden and the Villa is very small in comparison with that from the Imperial Palace (Table 1). Two reasons can be considered about it: firstly, insufficiency of the survey both in quantity and quality; and secondly, poorer habitat for the heteropterous insects than in the Imperial Palace. Survey in the Palace was made on 22 days from 1996 to 1999, but only on 7 days from 2002 to 2004 in the present survey. The second reason may be much more influential on existence of the insects. The Garden (ca. 51 ha) and the Villa (ca. 2 ha) have only a half area in total as the Palace. Besides this, the greater part of the green tracts of the Garden and the Villa are maintained well and natural vegetation and leaf-litter layer cover only a small area. The Garden and the Villa do not provide good habitat for aquatic Heteroptera. There is neither streams nor large ponds or moats grown with rich aquatic plants like Dokan-bori moat in the Imperial Palace. The majority of the heteropterous species recorded herein are very common even in the Kanto region including Tokyo. However, two endangered species were found there, i.e., Isometopus japonicus and Acrorrhinium inexpectatum. Hoplitocoris lewisi also becomes extinct in urban areas. Paloniella sp. is possibly an undescribed species. Although the environment of the Garden and the Villa may be less preferable for the heteropterous insects than that of the Imperial Palace, it still maintains a high value as a habitat of these insects in the large city of Tokyo.

N2  - Through a survey from June 2002 to October 2003 at the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Tokyo, 48 species of aphids were found from 50 host-plants. At the Imperial Palace, Tokyo (1996-2000), 96 aphid species were found from 95 host-plants (Matsumoto, 2000), and 44 species of aphids were found from 55 host-plants at the Institute for Nature Study, Tokyo (1998-2000) (Matsumoto, 2001). Eight species are common in these three sites, and 6 species of them are polyphagous. Although only the two common aphids between the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Institute for Nature Study are inhabitants of urban roadsides, those between the Akasaka Imperial Gardens and the Imperial Palace are 18, most of which are inhabitants of coppices and arable lands.

At the Imperial Palace, Tokyo (1996-2000), 27 species in 8 families were recorded (Tomokuni & Saito, 2000), and 29 species in 7 families were enumerated from the Institute for Nature Study (1998-2000) (Suda, 2001). The fauna of dragonflies is the richest in the smallest pond at the Akishinonomiya residence, in which as many as 18 species were collected by three supplemental researches in 2004.

N2  - The Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa is ca. 2 ha in area, and located in the central part of urban Tokyo. In the garden, there is a rather small, well kept pond, and faunal investigations on the dragonflies were carried out from 2002 to 2004. A total of 18 species belonging to 5 families were recorded, and larvae and larval cases of 9 species were found in the pond. Ceriagrion nipponicum, a rare damselfly in Tokyo, was discovered, and it is worth noting thatAnaciaeschna martini, Anax nigrofasciatus and Rhyothemis fuliginosa inhabited the pond.

N2  - Spider specimens of about 1,100 in all were obtained during faunal researches in the Akasaka Imperial Gardens, Minato-ku, Tokyo, made by the National Science Museum of Japan in the years between 2002 and 2004. These spiders were collected from various places in the Gardens by sweeping, beating, and sifting methods, by extraction with Tullgren Funnel and Malaise trapping as well as by collecting with hands. A hundred species of 24 families were recorded based on this material, including a trap-door spider Latouchia typica, which is registered in the red list of endangered animals of Japan as near threatened, and an unknown species of the theridiid genus Pholcomma, which seems new to science. The study site covers an area of 510,000 square meters and is composed of forests with evergreen oaks, Castanopsis cuspidata, Quercus glauca and Q. myrsinaefolia, and deciduous trees, Aphanathe aspera, Zelkova serrata, and Acer palmatum, some planted trees of Prunus mume and Chamaecyparis obtusa, open lawn, narrow paths and artificial ponds, belonging to villas of the Imperial Family. Between seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, the area was used by a Daimyo of Kishu Family in the Tokugawa Shogun Family for his residence and houses of his retainers, and their gardens and farms. However, in 1872 that was transferred to the Imperial Household Agency, and the gardens have been kept in nature under complete gardening care. Referring to the historical progress, nature of Akasaka Gardens should be similar to that of the Imperial Palace in Chiyoda-ku, only 2 km apart (Ono, 2000). More than 70% of species found in the Akasaka Gardens can live only in places with good vegetation. This fact indicates that the Akasaka Gardens play an important part in a green tract of urban area in the center of Tokyo.

N2  - The spider-fauna of Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo, was investigated in the years 1977-1978 and 2002-2004 mainly by extractions with Tullgren Funnel and Malaise trapping as well as by collecting with hands. About 400 specimens of spiders collected from various places in the gardens of the Villa were classified into 64 species of 22 families. The whole site of the Villa covers at present an area of about 20,000 square meters in Shibuya-ku Ward, in the center of Tokyo. The surroundings of the area were already urbanized in Edo Era since 17th Century and damaged through tea plantation, silk growing and pasturing cattle in the Meiji and the Taisho Era between!882 and 1923. After that, however, the area has been used for the Villa of Imperial Families and the gardens are kept in nature under gardening care. Almost all (97%) of the recorded species are common with those of other green areas in Tokyo city center as the gardens of the Imperial Palace, with the exceptions of a crab spider Lysiteles coronatus and a jumping spider Bristowia heterospinosa. Notes on these spiders and a relatively rare species Brommella punctisparsa (Dictynidae) are given.

A rare species, Neoribates pallidus Aoki, has been known only in Shikoku, but it was found from Honshu as the second record. Among the large green tracts of Tokyo Metropolis, the Akasaka Imperial Gardens is found to show the most rich oribatid fauna as in the Imperial Palace and the Meiji Shrine forest.

N2  - Free-living gamasid mites were studied in the Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa, Tokyo, and twenty-six species belonging to the nineteen genera of fourteen families were recorded. Of these, Gamasolaelapus ctenisetiger, Antennoseius imbricatus, Podocinum sagax, Holaspulus tenuipes, Parholaspis meridionalis have a definite southern affinity. In addtion to these five species, three other species were found in the litter of warm-temperate laurel forest. As a result, it is evident that the gamasid fauna of Tokiwamatsu Imperial Villa greatly reflects the fauna of the warm-temperate laurel forest. On the other hand, it is worth noting that a seeshore inhabitant, Halolaelaps sp., was found in the garden, where is remote from the Tokyo Bay.

N2  - The rostral fragment belonging to the large-mesorostral beaked whale, Mesoplodon tumidirostris Miyazaki & Hasegawa, 1992, was described from the Lower Pliocene Basal Conglomerate Bed of the Na-arai Formation (Ozaki, 1954) on the Boso Peninsula, central Japan. The new material from the Naarai Formation has large mesorostral ossification or supravomerine with a huge lump occupying the midline of the dorsal surface on the posterior part of the rostrum, which is slightly slanted to the right side at its posterior part. These characters are identical with those of M. tumidirostris known so far from ocean bottom near Hawaii Islands. Because the geologic age of the type material of M. tumidirostris is uncertain, the new occurrence of this species from the Lower Pliocene Na-arai Formation represents the first record from which the geochronological distribution of M. tumidirostris can be taken. Mesoplodon tumidirostris lived in deep sea at least around the Japanese Islands during the Early Pliocene (ca. 5.3-3.6 Ma) and might existed also from the low to middle latitudes in the North Pacific at that time.

N2  - The fossil tooth of Stegodon from Ajiro, Akiruno-shi, which was originally reported by Naora (1955) and later described by Mishima & Miyazaki (1985) under the name of S. orientalis, is now preserved in Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History (#KPM-NNV000008). Although the fossil tooth has been believed to be derived from the Pleistocene terrace deposits, we were able to confirm its exact locality, 200m downstream from the Ajiro Bridge in the Akigawa River, where the Lower Member of the Kasumi Formation (Late Pliocene) crops out. The reexamination of KPM-NNV000008 indicates that it evidently belongs to the large type Stegodon in Japan, showing the following characters; 1) number of ridges: 7; 2) width of crown: 79.2mm; 3) ridge frequency 3-4.5 ridges/10cm; 4) enamel folding: coarse and irregular; 5) enamel thickness: 5.6-6.5mm; 6) tooth class: Lower Right M2 and 7) stratigraphic horizon: Lower member of the Kasumi Formation (Late Pliocene). The large type Stegodon found in Japan was initially described by Matsumoto (1941) as Stegodon clifti miensis from Mie Prefecture, central Japan. Afterward, Sawamura et al. (1979) described Stegolophodon shinshuensis as a new species from Nagano Prefecture, central Japan. Taruno (1991) allocated the latter species to the genus Stegodon and regarded it the available name to the large type Stegodon in Japan. We agree that the large type Stegodon in Japan is distinctly a species and the former is identical with the latter. However, Matsumoto's S. c. miensis is doubtless valid according to the Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Article 45.1). Therefore S. shinshuensis should be regarded as a junior synonym of Stegodon miensis (new combination), of which the holotype is a lowerjaw with M3 (NSM-PV2193: National Science Museum, Japan).

N2  - Some large mammal fossils have been obtained from the Kasumi and Tama Hills located in the southern part of Kanto area except Yokohama region, Japan. These mammal fossils were discovered from the Kasumi and Komiya Formations in the Kasumi Hills, and from the Kazusa Group in the Tama Hills. In this paper, we determine clearly the locality of large mammal fossils that are deposited in public institutes, and discuss the age of formations based on the range of fossil mammal occurrences. Hitherto the name of formation in the Kasumi Hills were described as Lower and Upper part of Kasumi Gravel Bed and Lower and Upper part of the Komiya Sand Bed by the Research Group for Geology of the Western Hills of the Kanto Plain (1995). However, these names are unsuitable to the International Stratigraphic Guide. So in this paper, we call these formation names as follows, Lower and Upper Members of the Kasumi Formation and Lower and Upper Members of the Komiya Formation. The nominal taxa of fossil mammals from the Kasumi Hills were Stegodon miensis, S. sp. cf. aurorae, S. aurorae, Elaphurus shikamai, E. tamaensis, Cervus sp., Mysticeti gen. et sp. indet. The Kasumi Formation and Lower Member of the Komiya Formation are non-marine deposits. Stegodon miensis is found from Lower Member of Kasumi Formation in Akiruno City. Stegodon sp. cf. aurorae is discovered from Upper Member of Kasumi Formation. The Upper Member of the Komiya Formation yielded S. aurorae, Elaphurus shikamai, E. tamaensis, Cervus sp. and Mysticetes. The nominal taxa of fossil mammals from the Tama Hill were Stegodon aurorae, Cervus sp., Stellea sp., Eumetopias sp., Zalophus sp., Odontocetes. Stegodon aurorae is obtained from Oyabe Formation, Hirayama Formation, Renkoji Formation, Kakio Formation, Ozenji Formation and Takatsu Formation. Cervus sp. has been obtained from only Hirayama Formation in the Kazusa Group. The Hirayama Formation yields some marine mammal fossils as follows, Zalophus sp., Arctocephalinae, and some specimens of Odontocetes. The Iimuro Formation yields Stenella sp., Eumetopias sp. and some specimens of Zalophus sp.. The fossil foot prints were discovered from two the Upper Member of the Kasumi Formation on the Kasumi Hills and Oyamada Formation on the Tama Hill. These fossil foot prints include proboscidean's and artiodactyl's. It is divided by stratigraphic range of fossil Proboscidea that the Plio-Pleistocene formation of Japan (Taruno & Kamei, 1993; Taruno, 1999). In the study area, the Lower Member of the Kasumi Formation in the Kasumi Hills is assigned to the stratigraphic range of Stegodon miensis (-3.0Ma). The upper Member of the Kasumi Formation is assigned to the stratigraphic range of S. sp. cf. aurorae (ca. 3.0Ma-2.0Ma). The Komiya Formation is assigned to the stratigraphic range of Stegodon aurorae (ca. 2.0Ma-1.5Ma). The Oyabe Formation in the Kazusa Group, Tama Hills is assigned to the stratigraphic range of Stegodon aurorae (ca. 1.9Ma-).

N2  - The dictyostelid biota was investigated in Mikurajima Island and Hachijojima Island belonging to the Izu Islands located in the warm-temperate zone. Fourteen taxa were obtained from the both islands. Nine of them were identified with known species; Dictyostelium aureo-stipes, D. delicatum, D. monochasioides, D. mucoroides, D. polycephalum, D. purpureum, D. robustum, Polysphondylium candidum and P. violaceum. Another two were species complex: the Dictyostelium brefeldianum complex and the Polysphondylium pallidum complex. And the other three have not been identified yet and were tentatively treated as "Acytostelium sp.", "Dictyostelium monochasioides variant" and "Dictyostelium polycarpum variant". The sum total of species frequencies of dictyostelids was 230-310 in Mikurajima Island and 180-280 in Hachijojima Island. The flora of Izu Islands is characterized by warm-temperate vascular plants mixed with cool-temperate ones. It is interesting for a study of the dictyostelid biota of Izu Islands that D. delicatum, which is mainly distributed in the cool-temperate zone in Japan, was obtained from Mikurajima Island and Hachijojima Island.

N2  - A total of 262 lichen taxa representing 38 families, 96 genera, 254 species, 3 subspecies and 5 varieties were collected during fieldwork at Ozegahara moor and its adjacent areas. Although most taxa reported in the present paper are common or widely distributed in Japan, Brigantiaea sorediata is described as new to science and Adelolecia pilati, Farnoldia jurana, Leptogium subtile and Orphniospora moriopsis are reported as new to Japan. Bacidia baculifera, Fuscidea intercincta, Pyrenopsis controbatula and Rhizocarpon fujiyamae are second records for each species in Japan. It is noteworthy that an extensive colony of Dermatocarpon tuzibei, an endangered species in Japan, is found on exposed serpentine rocks along ridge between Mt. Koshibutsu and Mt. Shibutsu.

N2  - As a part of the project entitled the Natural History Researches of the Japanese Islands by the National Science Museum, Tokyo, the benthic animals were collected by dredging at shallow water off Shimoda, southern part of the Izu Peninsula, central Japan. The crabs collected were identified as 43 species of 39 genera, many of which were represented by juveniles, as shown in Table 2. The shallow-water crab fauna off east coast of the Izu Peninsula (=western part of Sagami Bay and Sagami Sea) were compared with that off west coast of the Miura Peninsula (=eastern part of Sagami Bay). The species known from Sagami Bay and Sagami Sea are 332 in all, of which 224 are recorded from the western part of Sagami Bay and Sagami Sea, and 289 are from the eastern part (Table 2). The rich fauna in the eastern part is depicted probably by sampling effort made by the late Emperor Showa (Emperor Hirohito) and also sampling site at the offshore banks. In spite of this fact, some southern species such as Frodromia atypica (Dromiidae), Calappa calappa (Calappidae), Pseudolambrus tuberculatus (Parthenopidae), and Charybdis amboinensis, Lissocarcinus polybioides, Lupocyclus philippinensis, Portunus longispinosus and Thalamita parvidens (Portunidae) are unrecorded from the eastern part. This may be reasonable, because the branch of the Kuroshio Current flows into Sagami Bay along east coast of the Izu Peninsula making the geographical northernmost barrier for these southern species.

N2  - Seventy-nine species of the Heteroptera in 19 families are recorded from Hachijo Island mostly on the basis of the material collected by the authors in 2001 as a part of a research project "the Natural History Researches of the Kanto Plain, Its Northern Mountains and Their Adjoining Areas" conducted by the National Science Museum, Tokyo. Hachijo Island is a volcanic island lying about 300 km south of Tokyo at the southernmost part of the Izu Islands. The Island receives more than 3000 mm of precipitation a year and the annual mean temperature is 18.3℃. Despite the favorable climatic condition, the heteropterous fauna of the Island is conspicuously poor, even though insufficiency of inventory surveys on the Heteroptera is taken into consideration. This volcanic island is still young in geologically and water system is, therefore, at an early stage of development. Accordingly, it cannot be inhabited by the most species of aquatic and semiaquatic heteropterans. Most probably due to the geological condition the flora of the Island is considerably poor. Consequently, specific diversity of the phytophagus Heteroptera still remains in low level.

N2  - The elevational gradient of species richness is often asserted to mirror the latitudinal gradient, and a monotonic decline in species richness with increasing elevation has been traditionally assumed. On the other hand, it has also been claimed that the species-richness curve was hump shaped rather than monotonic. Here I investigated elevational gradient of species diversity of birds at Mikura-jima Island, of which vegetation does not sustain much human disturbance. Bird line census during breeding season in 7-10 June 2001 at the island revealed hump shaped curve with the maximum at about 400 m altitude both in observed number of species and in species diversity. This shape of the curve could be mainly explained by the following. There are mainly four types of vegetation along altitude, which are secondary forest, evergreen forest, highland forest and grassland from low to high elevation. Number of bird species favoring each of the vegetation types as their habitat is dependent on the elevation where the vegetation distributes. The secondary forest, evergreen forest, highland forest and grassland, from low to high, are favored by 7, 9, 6 and 2 species of birds, respectively.

N2  - Many human skeletal remains have been excavated up to the present at archeological sites of the early modern Edo period (1603-1867 A.D.). Neverthelss, data on teeth from each site of the Edo period have rarely been reported. Therefore, the data on the maxillary permanent teeth of 166 male, 27 female, and 18 unknown-sex skulls from a site of the Edo period, i.e., Fukagawa-Unkoin Temple, Tokyo, were presented here as part of a future data base on the population history within the Japanese archipelago. Means and standard deviations were estimated for the mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters as well as for the mesiodistal neck diameters of all the maxillary teeth, and for the depths of lingual fossa of the maxillary incisors. As for non-metric tooth crown characters such as shoveling, the Carabelli trait, etc., the frequencies of four expressivities for each character were calculated. A preliminary analysis by the use of Mahalanobis' D^2 distance based on nine tooth crown diameters shows that the Fukagawa-Unkoin sample is closest to the pooled sample of the Edo period from the Kanto district among 35 comparative samples from prehistoric, historic, and modern East Asians. Although this result seems reasonable, there are a few problems in processing data which are originally related with small sample size. Therefore, in order to reconstruct the exact interrelations between sub-populations within the Japanese archipelago, much larger amount of detailed data for each site should further be accumulated.

N2  - A floritic study of epiphytic diatoms on red algae was made in the Tokunoshima Island of the Amami Islands in sounthwestern Japan. Bostrychia radicans, B. tenella and Caloglossa leprieurii var. hookeri were selected as the substrate algae from the estuary of the Wannya River and the lagoon of Boma. Among 92 taxa of diatoms belonging to 25 genera found there, the following 7 taxa were regarded as the dominant and subdominant species; Amphora tenerrima, Denticula subtilis, Gomphonemopsis pseudexigua, Navicula contenta, N. gregaria, Nitzschia frustulum and Synedra tabulata var. parva. The same diatom floras were found on three different red algae at the present localities.

N2  - Isl. Amami-oshima (Fig. 1) lies in ca. 129°30' E. longitude and ca. 28°20' N. latitude. The temperature of yearly mean is 21.3℃. In this island, as a part of the taxonomic studies of Cyrtomium falcatum, 85 specimens and 9 living stocks of this species were collected from 36 plots (Fig. 1) for the following studies : distribution, habitat, character-variation of laminae, pinnae and indusia, chromosome numbers, and reproductive type. As a result, distribution was restricted within 500 m distance from seaside and below 20 m above the sea level in spite of the wide range of distribution of this species in othe regions. The habitats were very variable : i.e. on rocks in open place near seaside (Fig. 2), with occasionally some flooded stocks at high tide, on cliffs on edges of forests, on stone walls along road, slopes or floors in evergreen broad-leaved forests. All materials (85 specimens and 9 living stocks) belonged to the apogamous type based on the examination of the number of spores per sporangium. Chromosome number of the 9 stocks were 2n=123 (Fig. 3) in root tip mitosis. These facts indicate that Cyrtomium falcatum in Isl. Amami-oshima were proved to be the apogamous triploid taxa. Variation extent in length of laminae, size and shape of pinnae (Fig. 4), and color of indusia were observed and discussed. These characters are very variable. The results are shown that apogamous triploid taxa in Isl. Amami-oshima have intermediate characteristic between sexual diploid and sexual tetraploid species occured in other regions. In the appendix, nomenclatural treatment of sexual diploid, apogamous triploid, and sexual tetraploid taxa of Cyrtomium falcatum (s. l) was discussed.

N2  - Wood-decaying Hymenomycetes were collected in Amami-oshima Isl. (Kagoshima Pref.) mainly in 1989. Some tropical species were found for the first time from the Island. The distribution patterns of the species found from the Island are as follows. Species widely distributed in Japan : Bjerkandera adusta, Daedaleopsis confragosa, Coltricia montagnei, Hymenochaete mougeotii, Ganoderma lipsiense. Species distributed from the tropical region to the warmer region along the Pacific Ocean : Dictyopanus gloeocystidiatus, Corticium argenteum, Microporus flabelliformis, Nigroporus vinosus, Cyclomyces tabacinus, Phellinus umbrinellus, Polystictus substygius. Species distributed from the tropical region to the southern part of Kyushu (and/or occasionally to Honshu, Shikoku) : Cymatoderma lamellatum, Lenzites platyphylla, Loweporus fusco-purpureus, Tinctoporellus epimiltinus, Trametes rhodophaea, Phellinus mcgregorii. Species distributed from the tropical region to the southern part of the Cape Sada-misaki, Ohsumi Pen., Kagoshima Pref. : Panus fulvus, Erythromyces crocicreas. Species distributed from the tropical region to Amami-oshima Isl. or to Tane-ga-shima Isl. : Oudemansiella canarii, Daedalea aurora, Nigrofomes melanoporus, Trametes retropicta. Daedalea aurora and Nigrofomes melanoporus have been recorded only from Iriomote Isl. in Japan. Most species collected from the Island were warm temperate, subtropical or tropical species.

N2  - The Tokara Islands, consisting of some 12 larger and smaller Cenozoic volcano islands, are situated between Yakushima and Amami Ohshima, off Kyushu, in southwest Japan. It is noteworthy that the Watase Line, which defines a boundary between the Palearctic and the Indomalayan regions, passes through the islands. Despite the zoogeographically interesting position of the islands, their avifauna hand received little attention until very recently. I made two trips to the islands, in June-July and August 1989,and collected representative bird specimens there. This paper gives distributional records and taxonomic notes on 26 breeding bird species (one is an introduced species) on the islands. Of 25 native breeding birds discussed in this paper 10 have origin on the Amami Islands and six on Japan mainland, Yakushima, or the Izu Islands. The breeding avifauna is no doubt a mixture of immigrants from all surrounding areas, although the immigrants from Amami Ohshima predominate (40%). Most interesting cases are the occurrences of the Izu Islands Thrush Turdus celaenops and of the Ijima's Willow Warbler Phyllscopus ijimae, both showing discontinuous breeding distribution in the Izu and the Tokara islands (T.celaenops also occurs on Yakushima). They are probably direct immigrants from the Izu Islands, contra to the relic hypothesis advocated by YAMASHINA (1942) and more recently by KAWAJI et al.(1989).

Among them, the species has not been hitherto recorded from Kikai Island, but in December of 1989 we collected five specimens of this species from sugar-cane farm in this island. As the results of comparison among six island populations of Crocidura, it became clear that these populations belong to the same taxon, C. watasei. We collected WATASE's shrew from barren land, bank and sugar-cane farm, but could not obtain them in glass land in a mountain and broadleaf forest. The species seems to be most common in sugarcane farm.

N2  - Vertebrate paleontological and paleoanthropological survey was carried out in Tokunoshima and Amami-oshima islands in December, 1989,as part of the Natural History Research Project of Japanese Islands led by the National Science Museum. A total of seven localities in Tokunoshima were surveyed. Gushikyan, a small dry cave near Kempuku (Fig. 1-1) yielded 5 species of small mammals (Crocidula sp., Rhinolophus cornutus, Pentalagus furnessi, Diplothrix legata, and Tokudaia osimensis; Fig. 3), all of which are known as living species. Their precise age is unknown but inferred as historic in age from an analysis of fluorine content of a bone remain. A child skeleton from Yowoki shelter (Fig. 1-3) was studied in detail by Baba and others, and is reported elsewhere in this issue. Hard travertine containing numerous fossil deer bones has been known from the cliff located west of Kojima (Fig. 1-4). The travertine was loosened with acetic acid and produced numerous specimens of Cervus (Metacervulus) astylodon with a few specimens of Pentalagus furnessi, Diplothrix legata, and Tokudaia osimensis (Fig. 3). Cervus (Metacervulus) astylodon was studied in detail by Otsuka (this issue). Small mammal fossils were newly found from Tokunoshima (Tomida and Otsuka, in prep). Tooth plates of a Diodon sp., a porcupinefish (Fig. 4) were found in the Itokina Formation at Inutabu-misaki (Fig. 1-5), and a tooth of a Heterodontus sp., a bullhead shark (Fig. 5) was obtained from the Kametsu Formation at Kametoku (Fig. 1-6), both of the Ryukyu limestone. No fish fossils had been previously known from Tokunoshima. Although no Ryukyu limestone is known from Amami-oshima Island, there are some Paleozoic-age limestone bodies within the Yuwan Formation in western Yamato-son and northern Uken-son. Two routes along the limestone bodies and an abandoned quarry were surveyed (Fig. 7), but no vertebrate or human remains were found.

N2  - Abundant Late Pleistocene deer fossils and a few other fossil mammals were excavated from the Pleistocene fissure deposits exposed on the sea cliff of the Ryukyu Limestone, located in southwest Tokuno-shima. Fossil deer bones from Tokuno-shima are morphologically referable to Cervus (Metacervulus) astylodon MATSUMOTO (=Ryukyu-jika) from the Okinawa Islands, but they are smaller than those of latter islands. It is supposed that the ancestral form of Ryukyu-jika from Tokuno-shima may have migrated from the Asiatic mainland via "Ryukyu land bridge" which was formed by the glacial lowering of sea level and uplifting of the "Shimajiri sea" in Early Pleistocene. Dwarfing of the deer in Tokuno-shima may have begun after the separation of Tokuno-shima from the Okinawa Islands by the Middle Pleistocene transgression called "Ryukyu coral sea".

N2  - A Child skeleton was found in a small limestone shelter near Yowoki Cave in Isen-cho, Tokunoshima, Kagoshima Prefecture (Figs. 1,2). It comprises most part of the skull including mandible, right and left humeri, right femur, and right and left tibiae (Figs. 3,4,6). The skeleton is presumed to be a boy of nine years. An analysis of fluorine content of the bones suggests that this skeleton might be attributed to a historic or protohistoric age not younger than Early Modern age (MATSU'URA, 1990). The face is extremely low and rectangular in frontal view (Fig. 1,Tables 1,2). The limb bones are short for his age (Table 4). There are a few characters which resemble those of Neolithic Jomon skeletons; a projected glabella, a depressed nasion, and flattened stout humeri (Figs. 5,7). However, these characters should also be considered as the indication of male feature. There are sveral traits which fit to those of the historic skeletons; saddle-shaped nasal bones, deep and narrow mandibular fossae, lesser dental wear, and wide tibiae (Figs. 4,5,6,7). Extreme lowness of the face and the stature and depression around the nasion may reflect regional characters in Tokunoshima Island, which is located near Okinawa Islands and far from the main land of Japan. A shallow transverse groove is seen in a lower part of the frontal squama, which might be caused by a bandage (Figs. 4,5).

HORIK. is usually characterized by the underleaves which are apparently longer than wide, and it is distinguished from extremely polymorphic B.tridens (REINW., BL.&NEES) TREV. by this character (KITAGAWA, 1972; MIZUTANI&CHANG, 1986). Basedon the field survey in Amami Oshima, type locality of B.oshimensis, and studies in the type specimens of B.oshimensis and related species, B.oshimensis should be treated as a habitat modification of polymorphic B.tridens, as follow.

N2  - The moss flora of the Amami Islands (Lat.27°-30°N, Long. 128°-130°E, with the highest peak 694m a.s.l. in Amamioshima I.), Ryukyu Archipelago was investigated. There are recognized 207 species (including subspecies and varieties counted as species), based on examination of specimens and review of the literature. 39 species were newly found for the Islands. Phytogeographical analysis of 209 species showed the moss flora to comprise 101 East Asian, 71 paleotropic, 6 pantropic, 12 panboreal, and 19 other species. The moss flora was compared with those of some other regions in Japan and proved to be most closely related to that of Yaeyama Islands, also placed in the Ryukyu Archipelago, where tropical elements far exceed East Asian elements in number. No endemic species were recognized for the area other than 3 species and one variety which have not been taxonomically evaluated since their original descriptions early in this century.

N2  - Thirteen populations of Cyclosorus acuminatus, C.parasiticus and their putative hybrid from Amami Island which lies on 29°00' -29°30' N.latitude, 129°00' -129°50' E.longitude have been investigated for morphological variations within a single individual (phenotypic plasticity), between individuals (individual variation) and between populations (population variation). The aim was to carify the above variation and the region of the species. The locality of each population is given in Table 1 and Figure 1. The following characteristics were observed : the shape and size of the spores, chromosome numbers, hair on the surface of leaf and the shape of indusium. Measured parts are indicated on Figure 2. To investigate phenotypic plasticity and individual variation, all leaves were taken from a single individual within each population. To study variation between populations, the largest fertile leaf was taken from all individuals in each population. The samples collected consisted of 133 specimens from 13 populations. These specimens were divided into two types based on the shape and size of the spores. As a result, 59 specimens had regualr spores and 74 specimens had irregular spores. The 59 specimens which had regular spores were determined to be C.acuminatus, (25 specimens) and C.parasiticus, (34 specimens) by Nakaike's system (Nakaike 1982). Other specimens which had irregular spores were determined to be a putative hybrid between C.acuminatus and C.parasiticus. Chromosome counts indicated that C.acuminatus was 2X(2n=74), C.parasiticus was 4X(2n=144), and putative hybrid was 3X(2n=108), The results of chromosome counts supported the claim that a putative hybrid is a hybrid between C.acuminatus and C.parasiticus. Phenotypic plasticity in a single individual showed variation in the size of the leaf (FL, SL, PL, PW, AN, LL). However, in the number of midrib branches (NV) and number of costa branches (PNV), there was almost no variation. In terms of individual variation, variations in the number of midrib branches (NV) and costa branches (PNV), and sours (SN) were observed. In the variation between populations variation in pinna width (PW) was observed. The morphological characteristics (shape and size of spore, chromosome number, hair on surface of leaf, shape of indusium, number of midrib branches of apex of lamina and number of costa branches) were independent between C.acuminatus and C.parasiticus. The putative hybrid combines the morphological features of C.acuminatus and C.parasiticus which are its putative parents. The morphological variations between the putative hybrid and C.parasiticus overlap with regard to variations of spore ornamentation, hair on surface of leaf and shape of leaf, so the species are not distinguished by the above characteristics. However, the three species are obviously distinguished by the number of joined lateral veins (AN), the distance between two adjacent stipe of rhizome (SD) and stomata length (STL). The distance between two adjacent stIpe of rhizome (SD) is an especially useful diangostic characteristic to discriminate between the three specles.

N2  - The heteropterous fauna of the Amami Islands, the Ryukyus, southern Japan, has been poorly known up to the present. In this report, 76 pentatomomorphan species are recorded as the first part of the faunal studies on Heteroptera of theIslands. Of these, about 65% are regarded as the Oriental elements. Many of them seem to be "newcomers" to the Japanese fauna having spread their distributional ranges by expansion of tillage of such cultivated crops as rice, beans, melons, citruses, and so on (cf.TOMOKUNI, 1979,1981,1985). Notobitus meleagris is probably the latest invader of them, which seems accidentally transported from Formosa to the Ryukyus in the 1970's being accompanied with stocks of an edible bamboo (HASEGAWA, pers. comm.). Though the southern Palearctic elements are apparently inferior to the Oriental species in the pentatomomorphan fauna of the Islands, three of them, Sastragala scutellata, S.esakii and Rhopalus sapporensis, become slightly differentiated morphologically in this Islands from those of the Japan proper. This fact suggests the possibility that these species immigrated into the Japanese Archipelago when the Amami Islands were connected by land with Japan proper.

N2  - We studied twelve individuals of Ryukyu spiny rats, Tokudaia from Amamioshima Is.(T.o.osimensis). and Tokunoshima Is.(T.sp.). Each individual was examined for chromosome, serum protein, mitochondrial DNA and ribosoma1 DNA polymorphism. The karyotypes were analyzed by the G-banding staining method. The diploid chromosome number of Tokudaia obtained from Amamioshima and Tokunoshima were 25 and 45 respectively in lung tissue culture preparation. Agarose-gel electrophoretic analysis of the serum protein was used to document relationship between two species. Totally three bands of transferrin (Tf) protein were observed on agarose ge1. Tf^a and Tf^b type were seen in T.o.osimensis and Tf^t and Tf^b type in T.sp. The serum albumin patterns of these rats were not identical. The cleavage patterns of mitocondoria1 DNA (mtDNA) from two Tokudaia species were investigated using several restriction enzymes. The sequence divergence between T.o.osimensis and T.sp. about 16.2% was estimated. Genetic differentiation of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) non-transcribed-spacer sequences was analyzed in the two species. Southern blot analysis with a mouse rDNA probe and some restriction enzymes revealed that the major restriction fragments of these Tokudaia species had a unique pattern in the spacer region. The divergence time between T.o.osimensis and T.sp. was calculated about 2&acd;4 million years. Based on the significant genetic divergence shown we conclude that T.sp. is a taxonomically from T.o.osimensis.

N2  - Floral characteristics of late Early to early Middle Miocene Daijima-type floras in southwestern Hokkaido and in the northern part of Honshu are noted, comparing with contemporaneous floras from Sakhoalin to Central Honshu. The compostition and floral characters of the Fujikura and Takinoue floras are described on the basis of new materials. The Fujikura flora in Aomori Prefecture, Honshu, is more similar to the Utto flora in its composition than the Yoshioka flora, though both are close geographically. The Takinoue flora in the southern part of central Hokkaido has a common feature to other floras in southwestern Hokkaido. Except for the Abura flora, almost all the floras in Sakhalin and northern Japan are lowland-type floras. They show the latitudinal gradient in vegetation during the late Early to early Middle Miocene. The evergreen broad-leaved forest admixed with several oak-laurel elements in northern Honshu was replaced by the deciduous broad-leaved forest to the north. The lowlandtype floras in southwestern Hokkaido, together with the Takinoue flora in central Hokkaido, represent a transitional zone of both forests.

N2  - The flora and distribution of dictyostelid cellular slime molds were investigated in Juni-ko, Mt. Iwaki and Mt. Hakkoda located in Aomori Prefecture. More than 16 taxa were obtained, of which fourteen were described dictyostelids; namely, Dictyostelium aureo-stipes CAVENDER, RAPER et NORBERG var. aureo-stipes, D. brefeldianum HAGIWARA, D. capitatum HAGIWARA, D. delicatum HAGIWARA, D. discoideum RAPER, D. firmibasis HAGIWARA, D. implicatum HAGIWARA, D. microsporum HAGIWARA, D. minutum RAPER, D. parvisporum HAGIWARA, D. purpureum OLIVE, D. septentrionalis CAVENDER, Polysphondylium candidum HAGIWARA and P. violaceum BREFELD. The other taxa have not been identified yet; they were indicated as "Acytostelijum sp.", "Polyspondylium pallidum group" and "Dictyostelium spp." in the text. From the results of this investigation, it was reconfirmed that the species diversity of dictyostelids is not only wider in the deciduous broad-leaved forest than in the evergreen conifer forest but also affected by the change of species diversity of trees in the forest composition. Additionally, the following three respects were suggested : 1. The sum total of species frequencies of dictyostelids is between 300 and 375 in the Fagus crenata forest located in the upper part of the cool-temperate zone, and between 39 and 229 in the Pinus pumila forest. 2. In Juni-ko, the occurrence of the subtropical and/or warm-temperate species of dictyostelids is due to the influence of the warm sea current, the Tsushima Current, going up north near by. 3. In Mt. Hakkoda, the wide diversity of dictyostelids in the subalpine zone is due to the great diversity of deciduous tree species which is probably caused by the poor development of the subalpine conifer forest.

N2  - Cyrtomium falcatum (L.f.) PR. (s.l.), Dryopteris varia var. saxifrage (H. ITO) H. OHBA and var. setosa (THUNB.) OHWI comprise the taxonomically most difficult fern group in Japan. To clearify the sexual situations of these taxa in Aomori Pref., northern Japan, the field researches and herbarium studies at TNS have been caried out with special reference to the reproductive type and the variation of some morphological characters (i.e. size and shape of spore and stomata, ect.). Forty specimens of Cyrtomium falcatum, s.l. were collected in various places (Fig. 1). This species occurs on the rocks very near the sea. These specimens were divided into two types based on the number of spores in each sporangium; thirty-six specimens were of the sexual type and four specimens of the mixed type which has both the sexual and apogamous type in a sorus (Tab. 1,Fig. 2,and Fig. 3). In the mixed type, ratio of sexual type to apogamous type in a sporangium of each sorus is ca. 7.8 : 1 (Tab. 1). Only a single specimen of the apogamous type was found among herbarium materials. Shape of frond and pinna (Fig. 5), shape and size of spore, and size of stomata (Fig. 4) of both types were observed and measured. Distribution map of both types (Fig. 6) were presented based on the specimens collected in the present work and the specimens deposited in TNS. Thirty-one specimens of Dryopteris varia group were also collected in various places (Fig. 1). These specimens were divided into two types based on the number of spores in a sporangium; eighteen specimens of the sexual type were determined to be Dryopteris varia var. saxifrage (Fig. 9), and thirteen specimens of the apogamous type to be var. setosa (Fig. 9). Variation in the shape and size of stomata and spore were observed and measured for both types (Fig. 7). These two taxa are closely related each other in the size and shape of frond, lamina and indusium, color of scale, and position of sorus, but clearly different in the scales at the upper part of stipe (Fig. 8). Var. saxifraga grows on slope on the edge of forests and on the wet rocks along streams, and var. setosa on slope of forests near small streams, and on wet rocks in forests. These two taxa are growing sympartrically in the northernmost place of Aomori Pref. Distribution map (Fig. 9) of var. saxifraga and var. setosa were presented based on the specimens collected in the present work and those deposited in TNS.

N2  - In contrast to the common occurrence in Honshu and Kyushu, Hypericum pseudopetiolatum is rarely found in Hokkaido. In order to discuss the presumed origin of plants of H. pseudopetiolatum in Hokkaido, allozyme variations in two populations collected in Hokkaido were investigated electrophoretically. As a result, it was revealed that (1) the two populations in Hokkaido exhibited considerably high values of Nei's genetic identity ranging from 0.96 to 0.97 with some populations in Tohoku District, and (2) all plants in Hokkaido were fixed in Mdh-4^<15> which had been exclusively detected in some populations in Tohoku District. On the basis of these genetic evidences, it is suggested that H. pseudopetiolatum has become distributed in Hokkaido by comparatively recent migrations from Honshu, probaly from Tohoku District.

N2  - In order to predict the process of the northern limit formation of the Japanese beech, Fagus crenata, the ecological characteristics of the dominant trees on the beech forests in the district of it's northern limit, Hokkaido, Japan were examined from the view-point of vertical distribution patterns in the climax forests. The vertical distribution patterns of the dominant trees were analyzed utilizing the data from 581 climax forests in Hokkaido. The quantification of the vertical distribution patterns was made as follows; firstly, a coefficient of the rank of stand precedense (CRSP) was calculated as the ratio of the maximum tree height of a given species within the stand to the maximum tree height of the stand; secondly, a coefficient of the grade in the vertical distribution (CGVD) was calculated as the average of CRSP of a given species; and finally the vertical distribution patterns were expressed as the frequency distribution of CGVD of a given species. As a result of the above analysis, CGVD of dominant trees in the climax forests of the Mixed forest zone in Hokkaido ranged from 50 to 85. While CGVD of Fagus crenata was 97 corresponding to the maximum value among dominant trees. The vertical distribution patterns of the dominant trees were distinguished as the five types (Fig. 3,i.e. , ) (1) the Fagus crenata type, (2) the Betula ermanii type, (3) the Quercus mongolica var grosseserrata type, (4) the Abies sachalinensis type, (5) the Acer mono type. Fagus crenata was considered to be a species occupying the forest canopy layer without codominant species. While Quercus and Abies, the main dominant species in the further northern area of the northern limit of Fagus, occupied the forest canopy layer, middle layer and lower layer in the mixed forests. Furthermore spatial distribution of the tree species (Fagus, Abies, Quercus) was discussed.

N2  - Northern limit of Japanese beech forest which characterizes Japanese cool temperate zone exists in Kuromatsunai Depression in southern part of Hokkaiodo. The pure stands of beech are well developed continuously as far as the Depression but in the area of Kuromatsunai about 10 km northeastward, not only beech forest but one beech tree cannot be seen (Fig. 1). There are many point of views about the causes of rapid extinction of beech trees, for instance : temperature, precipitation, volcanic activities, forest fires, palynological chronology, etc. has been insisted as the expecting factors. But definite clarification about growth patterns of beech trees in this area have been rare until recently. Using stumps and increment borers, the patterns of the diameter growth of beech trees in this area were investigated. And these patterns were compared with similar ones in central Honshu. The diameter growth rate with the average values in Hokkaido was 5mm/year in 0-50 years, 7mm/year in 50-100 years and 2mm/year in more than 100 years (Fig. 2). Comparing these with those at various places in Honshu, the former is about two times larger than the latter as showing in Fig. 3. But as the difference of the mean maximum diameter-at that size the trees die-between both districts is not so obvious, it appears that the mean life spans of both districts have a large difference : 170 years in northern limit, 250 years in central Honshu respectively. These properties of early maturity and short life span, which caused by the rapidity of tree growth rate show that the span of natural regeneration of beech forests in northern limit must be shorter than those of Honshu. By observations of transplanting of beeches from various localities it was suggested that these properties are depend upon the ecotypic differentiation of beech at each locality.

N2  - A survey of the benthic polychaetes was carried out in Ishikari Bay, Hokkaido, in depths 23 to 100m, for the Natural History Research Project of the Japanese Islands. Sixteen species of polychaetes were previously recorded by UCHIDA (1968) from Ishikari Bay. In the present study 103 species and 32 indeterminable species in 34 families were recognized. The biomass of polychaetes at the area including Sts. 9 to 18 is dominant than the other stations. Therefore this area also seems to be a good fishing-ground for benthic fishes. Seven species of serpulids only were found from this area : two serpulids of Hydroides elegans and H. multispinosa distributed in the warm waters are included among them.

N2  - The number of fish species collected from the waters of Aomori Pref., recently attains to above 600 of 193 families. From the waters of Japan Sea and Western Tsugaru Strait around Aomori Pref., the number of fish species attains to 354 of 142 families and those of the waters of the Pacific, 383 of 152 families. The abundance of the fishes known from the Pacific refers to the rich ichthyofauna of the deep sea. The fishes of northern limit of dispersal, corresponding to the coastal waters of Aomori Pref. are extremely abundant, and they are counted up 155 species. But, those of southern limit of dispersal are very poor, only 16 species. It refers to the fact that the extent of Oyashio-cold current is very wide, spreading southernly to the whole area of Tohoku District in cold seasons. When comparing to the overwhelming abundance of the fishes of northern limit of dispersal and the poverty of southern limit of dispersal, it is apparent that the waters of Aomori Pref. is located in the northern limit of temperate zone and cold-temperate zone. From the view point of zoogeography of fishes, coastal waters of Aomori Prefecture is divided into three parts; temperate zone (Japan Sea to Ohmazaki), cold-temperate zone (Ohmazaki to Pacific Ocean) and intermediate-temperate zone (Mutsu Bay).

N2  - A statistics for comparisons of the avifaunas of Hokkaido and Honshu is given (Tables 1-9). It has been shown that the breeding avifaunas are very similar to each other both in the number of species and their composition according to family groups, habitats, and main food habits, although about 20% of the species concerned is not common to both avifaunas. There are more differences either in the number of species and the composition of non-breeding species and stragglers. In general the percentages of littoral and forest species were higher in Hokkaido and those of pelagic and grassland species were higher in Honshu. There were always more non-passerine species than passerine ones in each category, due probably to high percentage of water birds, which are non-passerine.

The archaeological age of the bones was thought to be Esan episode in earlier Epi-Jomon period. The bones belonged to at least two individuals, which were designated as Skeletons No. 1 and No. 2. The former included most of the bones, consisting various parts of cranial, truncal and limb bones. They showed the perinatal or neonatal stage of development. The latter skeleton was represented by a fragment of scapula, and possibly by a few other parts of the bones. The scapula was a little smaller in size, and might be in a fetal stage of development 2 to 3 weeks earlier than that of No. 1 individual.

N2  - The human permanent teeth of Epi-Jomon Period (Esan Culture Phase) from Usu-10 Site on an islet in Funkawan Bay, Hokkaido, were measured. The least sample size was ten. Through comparisons with 16 other East Asian samples of different periods by the use of PENROSE's shape distance, it was found that the variation pattern in dental size of the Epi-Jomon people from the seaside region along Funkawan Bay including the Usu-10 remains was far more similar to that of the Jomon people from the same region than to those of the Jomon people from Honshu and of other Asian samples. The sample which was next closest to the Epi-Jomon people among the samples compared was the modern Ainu in Hokkaido. These facts suggest that the microevolutionary process from the Jomon age to the present in Hokkaido is a little different from that in Honshu or the Asian continent. In addition, it was confirmed that the dental variation patterns of the Epi-Jomon and Jomon people from the southern part of Hokkaido were very similar to those of modern hunter-gatherers like the Inuit, Australian Aborigine, San, etc., suggesting that dental similarity between populations does not necessarily imply phylogenetic affinity between them.

N2  - The stature of the Epi-Jomon Esan people in Hokkaido was estimated from the maximum length of the femur based on the regression formula of FUJII (1960). The results are given in Tables 1 and 2. Since the average stature was 159.5cm in the male and 150.0cm in the female, the Esan people seemed to be slightly taller than the Honshu Jomon (Figs. 1 and 2). Stature was relatively high during the Jomon and Epi-Jomon periods in Hokkaido and decreased slowly during the last 2,000 years. In Honshu, stature increased from the Jomon to the Yayoi or Kofun period and decreased gradually to recent times (Table 3,Fig. 3). Tibio-femoral indices were also calculated based on the maximum length of the femur and tibia (Tables 1 and 2). In Hokkaido, this index was stable for people from the Jomon to the recent Ainu period (Table 4,Fig. 4).

N2  - The historical transition of the Miocene volcanic centers are deduced from the distribution of volcanic central facies (lavas and volcanic breccias) in the northern Honshu. Transitions of volcanic fields took place in the following four stages; 1) earlier than 18 Ma, 2) 18-15 Ma, 3) 15-12 Ma, 4) later than 12 Ma. In the first stage, volcanic activity in the northern Honshu was restricted to the area along the Japan Sea coast. The volcanic front shifted eastwards to the Backbone Range and reached the Pacific coast in the second stage. The southern part of the northern Honshu (Hachinohe&acd;the northern part of Iwate Prefecture) became a site of volcanic activity slightly later. Widening of the volcanic fields reached the climax at 15.5 Ma. The third stage was characterized by volcanism in a wide area after the opening of the Japan Sea. In the last stage, the volcanic front began to recede westwards to the eastern margin of the Backbone Range.

N2  - Modes of occurrence of the Miocene volcanic rocks in the northern part of the Tsugaru Peninsula are described and discussed in relation to the paleogeographic change of this area. This area has been suffered from sharp topographic transition; subsidence to uplift after the opening of the Japan Sea. The volcanic products older than 7Ma are submarine lava flows (Fuyube Formation, Tappi Andesite, Mimmaya Ryholite and Horozuki Volcanic Rock), while younger (7-5Ma) volcanic products are characterized by pyroclastic deposits including water-chilled bombs. Such a change of volcanic facies from submarine to terrestrial is corresponding to the paleogeographic change from subsidence to uplift in this area during late Miocene.

N2  - Uppermost 40 meters of the Hamada Formation yields abundant ostracods with very high species diversity. Most of the ostracod species are derived from tidal zone to lower sublittoral, and from rocky to sand and mud bottom habitats. Dominant members include constituents of the Omma-Manganjian fauna such as Schizocythere okhotskensis, Cytheropteron sawanense, Semicytherura subundata, S. henryhowei, Howeina camptocytheroidea, Finmarchinella spp., Palmenella limicola, Cytherre uranipponica, Loxocythere inflata, Urocythereis? gorokuensis, Ambossracon? kitanipponica, Patagonacythere robusta, Elofsonella coninna, Hemicythere spp., Robertsonites spp., Acanthocythereis dunelmensis, and Buffmicythere howei. The lower half of the sequence is dominated by cold water species, whereas in the upper half of the sequence cold temperate species of cold water origin become more abundant. Among these species is the characteristic warm water species Cythere omotenipponica which appears in sample C18. The boundary between the lower and upper sequences seems to be around the horizon of sample C20. Among these mixed assembleges of ostracods, two seemingly autochthonous ostracod associations with very low species diversity are detectable. One appears in the middle of the sequence (C22 and C24) and is characterized by the occurrence of Acanthocythereis tsurugasakensis, suggesting a deep (200-300m) water environment. The other appears at the top of the sequence (C4C, C4D and C4E) and characterized by the association of Neomonoceratina tsurugasakensis and Palmenella limicola, suggesting a muddy inner bay environment and retreating sea. Correlation of upper horizons between the Daishaka Formation and the Hamada Formation is suggestible based on combined ostracod occurrence and characteristics of intercalated tuff beds. Stratigraphic correlation and environmental analysis based on the ostracod assemblages cannot be further refined. An approach based on analysis of speciation of a certain species group seems to be far more useful even for these applied purposes.

N2  - Saussurea kudoana TATEWAKI et KITAMURA var. uryuensis is newly described here. S. kudoana var. uryuensis is discriminated from var. kudoana in having horizontally running rhizome and yellowish green leaves. This plant is endemic to the Uryu serpentine region of northern Hokkaido and its distributional range is geographically segregated from that of var. kudoana. S. kudoana has been frequently treated by Japanese workers as a infraspecific taxon of S. riederi. However, S. kudoana should be recognized as a distinct species, which is distinguished from S. riederi in the shape of involucres and outer involucral bracts, habit of cauline leaves and habitat preference.

N2  - 1. Three taxa of Caltha (Ranunculaceae) in Japan were cytologically examined. The following chromosome numbers were found : C. fistulosa Schipcz., 2n=32 and 2n=60; C. palustris L. var. enkoso Hara, 2n=60 and 2n=88; C. palustris L. var. nipponica Hara 2n=60 and 2n=88. Counts of 2n=60 and 2n=88 for C. palustris var. nipponica have here been reported for the first time. 2. Some irregularities in the meiotic division were observed in plants of Caltha fistulosa with 2n=32 and 2n=60,and in those of C. palustris var. enkoso with 2n=60. At diakinesis and metaphase I, chromosome rings or chains which are suggestive of reciprocal translocations were often found. 3. The two cytotypes of Caltha fistulosa were deviated in geographical distribution. The 2n=32 plants were widespread extending from the northern part of Hokkaido to Aomori Pref., while the 2n=60 plants were restrictedly located in north-central Hokkaido and a part of southwestern Hokkaido (Fig. 1). 4. The two cytotypes of Caltha palustris were different in range. The 2n=60 plants were widely distributed in Hokkaido, while the 2n=88 plants were confined to Aomori Pref., which is separated from Hokkaido by the Straist of Tsugaru (Fig. 2). 5. Anatomical examinations showed that Caltha fistulosa is different from C. palustris in the features appearing in cross sections of petioles (Fig. 4). These two species were also different in the season in which meiotic divisions are initiated; middle January to early February in C. fistulosa, and March in C. Palustris. The latter difference might reflect different histories of the two species regarding their invasions to Japan.

Total 182 meshes were investigated to have any information of presence or absence of the target species. Indigofera pseudo-tinctoria was not recorded in the present investigation. Plantago asiatica, Geranium nepalense, Trifolium repens and Petasites japonicus were widely distributed in the same way in spite of their different means of dispersal. Polygonum cuspidatum, Humulus japonica, Macleaya cordata and Portulaca oleracea were not recorded or scarcely found from the Shimokita Peninsula. Correlation between distribution pattern and climatic division was not clearly recognized.

N2  - Fifteen tingid species are recognized in Hokkaido, Japan. Of these, Cysteochila fieberi is newly recorded, and Agramma nexile, Stephanitis watanabei an d Physatocheila veteris are rediscovered after their original descriptions. Host-plants are also noted for several species, that is, a gramineous weed for Agramma nexile, Syringa reticulata for Leptoypha capitata, Artemisia montana for Tingis lasiocera, and Rhododendron brachycarpum for Stephanitis watanabei. The tingid fauna of Hokkaido is notably poor as compared with those of the other regions of Japan, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. It is, however, characterized by seven species (five of them are endemic to Japan) whose ranges in Japan are limited within Hokkaido. Only 4 of the 15 species are widely distributed from Hokkaido to Kyushu and none of them occur in common between Hokkaido and the Ryukyus. These facts suggest that the tingid fauna of Hokkaido mainly consists of northern Palearctic elements. On the other hand, 27 species or about 40% of the Japanese tingids, including such very common ones as Stephanitis nashi, S. takeyai, S. pyrioides, do not extend their ranges to Hokkaido beyond the Tsugaru Straits, though these are widespread from Kyushu or the Ryukyus to Honshu. Many of them seem to be of southern Palearctic or Himalayan-Chinese origins. It is probable that the Tsugaru Straits may have played a role of impassable barrier to the northward dispersal of these species of southern origin.

N2  - The genus Oregonia has been considered to comprise three species. They are 1) O. gracilis DANA, 1851,ranging from the Bering Sea southward to Monterey Bay along the North American coast and also southward to the Boso Peninsula along the Pacific coast of Japan and to the Yellow Sea coasts through the Sea of Japan, 2) O. bifurca RATHBUN, 1902,known from the Aleutian Islands and the Bering Sea, and 3) O. mutsuensis YOKOYA, 1928,recorded from some localities in Mutsu Bay and off northeastern Honshu, Japan. A close examination of a long series of specimens referable to Oregonia in the collection of the National Science Museum, Tokyo, suggests O. mutsuensis should be regarded as a young form of O. gracilis, which shows remarkable individual, sexual and developmental variations. The original description of O. mutsuensis is not sufficient for depicting its specific characters; short and divergent rostrum, rather smooth dorsal surface of the carapace, and triangular terminal segment of the male abdomen have been the features regarded by its author as being peculiar to his new species. According to the present study, however, all these features are characteristic of the young or juvenile individuals of O. gracilis smaller than about 1cm in the carapace length. The slender chelipeds of the type male of O. mutsuensis, 7.7mm in the length of carapace, shown in the original illustration, is also indicative of this fact. Its type specimens are not extant, so that it is safely considered to be a synonym of O. gracilis. Another representative of the genus, O. bifurca, known from north of Rat Island in the Aleutian Islands and Bowers Bank in the Bering Sea, is rare, but well established thanks to the important contributions of its original author and GARTH (1958). In the National Science Museum, Tokyo, there is a male from the sea far north of Midway Island at the latitude of 35°N. This species is characterized by having short divergent rostral spines and much wider carapace. This record has extended its geographical range considerably southward in the North Pacific.

N2  - Accretionary lapilli were sampled from Dogo, Oki Islands. The lapilli occur within the fine-ash deposits that rest on the middle Miocene diatomite. The lapilli are centimeter-size spheroids consisting of fine-grained fragments of glass, crystals of quartz, plagioclase and biotite, and lithic clasts. Glauconite and fragmental microfossils such as diatoms and siliceous sponge spicules are frequently included. Most of the microfossils are secondarily derived ones from the underlying strate during the eruption, because small blocky clasts of the diatomite are also present in the lapilli and matrix. The lapilli have two distinct textural zones : a massive core in which ash-particles are randomely distributed and a concentric rim consisting of fine- grained particles. The texture of the lapilli indicates that the core was formed as ill-sorted aggregates in the eruption plume and fine-grained as layers accreted on it. The formation of the lapilli were caused probably by rains of mud and lightning bolts in clouds of volcanic dust generated in relation to hydroexplosions.

The exposed basal part of the Formation is barren of microfossils hence its age is still unknown, the geological age of the Formation can be estimated to be the Early Devonian as a whole, not extending either into the Middle Devonian upward or into the Late Silurian downward.

This coral assemblage is called the Onimaru type, which is widely distributed in Japan from Kyushu to Honshu. Particularly, the morphology, geological range and distribution of genus Kueichou-phyllum are described in detail, for it is very important on the paleobiogeography of the Tethys area among these large simple rugose corals. The paleobiogeography of genus Heterocaninia and genus Yuanophyllum as very endemic corals of the eastern Tethys are also given.

Shiomi-dake, the Pinum pumila zone was confined to the alpine zone having a poor flora of cellular slime molds. On the other hand, it was suggested from the rich flora of cellular slime molds that the Pinus pumila zone penetrated into the upper part of subalpine zone in Mt. Hakusan.

N2  - On the basis of the floristic similarities examined by the present authors for the benthic species of the Chlorophyceae and the Phaeophyceae, the Japan Sea coasts may be divided into two phytogeographic regions : (1) from Kagoshima-ken (Cape Noma) to Tsugaru Strait and (2) from Tsugaru Strait to Hokkaido (Cape Nosappu). This result agrees well with OKAMURA's phytogeographical opinion. But the present study showed that the discontinuity of these two regions at Tsugaru Strait is not so strong. Being influenced with Tsushima warm current, these two regions have commonly temperate algal floras. From the view points of the phytogeographical indexes, I/H value and L/F value, the Noto Peninsula is considered to be situated in a warm temperate region of Japan Sea coasts. Further investigation will make it clear that this Peninsula has a warmer algal flora.

N2  - Aconitum of the Ryohaku Mountain Range were taxonomically studied through examination of natural populations and herbarium specimens. As the results, three types were recognized based on the difference in pedical pubescence, helmet and nectary shape and lateral sepal pubescence. These attributes were evaluated to be diagnostic in the classification of the genus Aconitum (e. g., KADOTA, 1981,1984). These three types (Type S, Type G and Type I) were classified as A. nipponicum, an undescribed aconite, and"A. hakusanense, " respectively. Then the unnamed aconite was described and named here as A. zigzag subsp. ryohakuense. Aconitum zigzag subsp. ryohakuense is a common aconite in the Ryohaku Mountain Range. The plants belonging to Type I (including the holotype specimens of"A. hakusanense"and A. hokurokuense) showed an intermediacy between the two taxa in the morphological characters stated above. Therefore Type I plants presumed to be of hybrid origin between them. This was also a case of natural hybridization between the species of the tetraploid Aconitum group (KADOTA, 1984). It was found that the populations at higher elevation sites of Mts. Hakusan were composed of A. nipponicum, A. zigzag subsp. ryohakuense and"A. hakusanense." On the other hand, the populations at lower elevation sites of the Ryohaku Mountain Range consisted of exclusively A. zigzag subsp. ryohakuense. Moreover, the populations at middle elevation sites included A. zigzag subsp. ryohakuense and"A. hakusanense." The difference in species composition of the populations may suggests the followings : 1) an alpine species (A. nipponicum) might hybridize with a montane species (A. zigzag subsp. ryohakuense) at the alpine zone of Mts. Hakusan; 2) presumable hybrids derived from the crossing might have extended their distributional range downward.

N2  - Distribution maps of sixteen popular plants (Tab. 1) in Ishikawa Prefecture, central Japan, were prepared on the basis of date files collected from various sources such as the specimens, literatures and personal informations of local botanists. A mapping program KENMAP was revised to convert three different types of mesh date, Locality Index, longitude and latitude and JIS mesh code, into common expression of line-printer map. Distribution patterns of Commelina communis, Geranium nepalense, Houttuynia cordata, Petasites japonicus, Plantago asiatica, Polygonum cuspidatum and Trifolium repens (Figs. 3d, 2b, 4a, 4d, 1d, 1b and 2d) are found to cover the prefecture uniformly. Capsella bursa-pastoris and Sagina japonica (Figs. 4b and 3c) are also widespread, but more scattered especially in the inland region. Cayratia japonica, Humulus japonica, Indigofera pseudo-tinctoria, Portulaca oleracea and Veronica persica (Figs. 5,2a, 2c, 3a and 1c) are not found from the inland region. Adenocaulon himalaicum and Macleaya cordate (Figs. 4c and 3b) were lacking from the alluvial plain.

N2  - A benthic survey was carried out around Dogo Island, the Oki Islands, by dredging at 15 sites from 13 to 55m deep; the attached organisms on ropes and buoys at Kamo were also collected by hand. The Oki Islands are influenced by the Tsushima Current, branched from the warm Kuroshio Current in summer; however, in winter the Tsushima Current is suppressed by the cold Liman Current. So that, the sea-surface temperatures around the Oki Islands are 25℃ in summer and 7℃ in winter. This report deals with the species of serpulids only. Twenty-four species in 13 genera were recognized; all except Serpula sp. are already reported from various localities in the Japanese waters. The regional distributions of these serpulids found in the Japanese waters to the Melanesian areas are shown in Table 2. From this data, the serpulids around Dogo Island are also found from Cape Shionomisaki, the Kii Peninsula, which is always washed by the Kuroshio Current. Based on this investigation, serpulides distributed in the warm waters are found throughout around Dogo Island.

N2  - Cephalopods collected by bottom trawl at depths of 40,60,80,and 100m from January to July, 1984 off Uyagawa, Shimane Prefecture were examined. Sixteen species plus 2 varieties were identified among which 3 species and l variety were new records to the cephalopod fauna of the Sea of Japan. Sepiidae and Lologinidae were dominant comprising 7 species plus 2 varieties and 4 species, respectively. Together with previous information, over 50 species of cephalopods are known from the Sea of Japan but no endemic species exists. Only 9 species are of cold water origins and the rests are warm water inhabitants. About half of the members are classified into neritic species and closely related with those of the adjacent waters to China. Pelagic species less contribute to the cephalopod fauna of the Sea of Japan compared to that of Pacific side and about half of them are considered to be decaying migrants from the south coming through the Tsushima Straits.

N2  - After an investigation of the spider specimens obtained by a field research in the Noto Peninsula and the southern part of Ishikawa Prefecture in Japan, 20 nominal species of the families Clubionidae, Gnaphosidae and Thomisidae have been recognized. Of these, Callilepis schuszteri, Tmarus hanrasanensis. T. rimosus, Synaema chickunii, Xysticus ephippiatus and X. kurilensis are newly recorded for the fauna of the areas. It can be said that these areas (up to 900m alt.) have a typical spider fauna in these families for lower altitudinal regions of Honshu with the climate between the cold and warm temperate zones. Notes are given on two interesting thomisid spiders, Tmarus hanrasanensis and Xysticus kurilensis. The sexual organs of these spiders have been newly illustrated. A new species, Clubiona uenoi, is described on the basis of the material collected by the present research.

N2  - The vertebral formula and scapular ratio of Mogera tokudae from Sado Island in Japan were studied. The vertebral formula indicates the number of cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and caudual vertebrae. The formula of this species is 7・13・6・6・13 and is distinctly different from that of 7・14・5・6・12 seen in Mogera wogura, M. minor and M. kobeae, and very similar to 7・13・6・5・13 of euroscaptor mizura mizura and Euroscaptor mizura ohtai, except for the difference in the number of elementary vertebrae constituting the sacrum. The mean value of scapular ratio, that is the percent of the length of scapula to the length of skull is 68.7% in Mogera tokudae. This ratio is much lower than those of 73.4 and 73.7% of M. wogura and M. kobeae respectively, and much higher than those of 63.7 and 63.21% of Euroscaptor m. mizura and E. m. ohtai, but not different from Mogera minor which is 69.5%. As indicated by the vertebral formula, Mogera tokudae may be more closely related to Euroscaptor mizura than to Mogera wogura, M. minor and M. kobeae.

N2  - At least fourteen individuals were identified in the skeletal remains which had been excavated in 1918 and thereafter from the Oozakai Cave site in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. The measurements of the postcranial bones of males suggested a strong similarity between the Oozakai people and the Tsukumo people of the Jomon period (2500B.C.-300B.C.). The customary bilateral evulsion of the upper and lower canines was confirmed in some of the maxillae and mandibles of this series, as was pointed out by previous authors.

N2  - The Unazuki schists are the representatives of the Unazuki zone of Southwest Japan. They are characterized by the progressive metamorphism of kyanite-sillimanite type. This paper presents the data of element partitioning between coexisting minerals in the Fe-Al-rich pelitic schists. The distribution coefficients, K_D^S, are as follows. K_D Mg-Fe chloritoid-staurolite} ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 (Fig.2). K_D Mg-Fe garnet-staurolite} ranges from 0.6 to 1.0,without correlation to the metamorphic grade (Fig.3). K_D Mg-Fe biotite-staurolite} ranges from 3.5 to 5.0,without correlation to the metamorphic grade (Fig.4). K_D Mg-Fe garnet-biotite} changes regularly with the metamorphic grade, but highly de-pends on the mineral compositions (Fig.5). K_D Mg-Fe chlorite-garnet ranges from 6.0 to 8.0,without correlation to the metamorphic grade (Fig.6). The partion of Ca between coexisting garnet and plagioclase and partition of Na, Ca, and K between coexisting plagioclase and muscovite change regularly (Figs. 7 and 8,respectively).

The monotypic genus, Eosardinella, is unique in having longitudinally elongated lateral scales, and two prominent opercular ridges along its anterior border. The relationship of this genus has been unknown, but some osteological characters suggest that this genus belongs to the subfamily Clupeinae, The shape of the second supramaxillary and the number of front-parietal striae of this genus resembles the modern clupeine genera Harengula and Herklotsichthys distributed in warm coastal waters.

N2  - The hepatic flora of the Oki Islands, Shimane Pref. (about 36°N and 133°E) comprises 72 species. Of them 42 species are distributed in the Japan-Korea-China area, 17 are palaeotropical, and the remaining 13 are ubiquitous species in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. No species of holarctic distribution were found in the Oki Islands. All of the hepatics observed in the Oki Islands are very common in low-land and montane areas of south-western Japan. Fourty of the 111 species of hepatics known from the Tsushima Islands are not known from the Oki Islands. Difference of microhabitats in both islands seems to cause the difference in the hepatic flora. It is noteworthy that Marchantia polymorpha, M. paleacea var. diptera and M. tosana are not found from the Oki Islands, although there are many suitable habitats for these species and they are rather common in neighbouring San-in district of western Honshu.

N2  - The heteropterous fauna of the Oki Islands lying far-off the Shimane Peninsula, western Honshu, Japan, has been poorly known up to the present. Eighty-six species of Heteroptera from there are listed in the present paper. Of these, 38 are newly recorded from the Islands based on the materials collected by the author's research made in 1984. These 86 species excepting Orius sp. are classified into the following five groups according to the difference in their distributional patterns as shown in the author's papers (TOMOKUNI, 1979,1981). Group 1 contains 18 species of the Oriental origin such as Macroscytus subaeneus. Scotinophara lurida, Nezara antennata, Plautia crossota stali, Leptocorisa chinensis and so on. Of these, Gardena melinarthrum is the most typical species of this group. As far as the author knows, this rare reduviid has been known only from Kyushu in Japan. Group 2 is predominant in the heteropterous fauna of the Islands. It consists of 36 species, that is Megacopta punctatissima, Poecilocoris lewisi, Halyomorpha mista, Homoeocerus unipunctatus, Piocoris varius and so on, distributed within the southern area of the Palearctic Region. Group 3 includes 24 species, whose ranges are limited within the northern part of the Palearctic Region, such as Legnotus triguttulus, Graphosoma rubrolineatum, Dybowskyia reticulata, Carbula humerigera and so no. One of the representatives of this group is Saldula scotica which dwells on the surfaces of large dry stones exposed in mountain streams. The heteropterous fauna of the Islands is comparatively rich in this group considering their low elevation. This seems to be attributed to the richness of vegetation. The 6 species, Nysius plebejus, Acalypta sauteri, Stephanitis takeyai, Amphiareus obscuriceps, Lygocoris (Apolygus) nigritulus and Gerris (Gerris) yasumatsui, are discriminated from the others as Group 4. Though they are endemic to Japan, all of them seem to be of Palearctic origin. Group 5 includes only one widespread species, Zicrona caerulea. The heteropterous fauna of the Oki Islands is rather poor, and most of the known species are common and widely distributed in the other areas of Japan. The following two reasons can be pointed out for this : 1) The area of the Islands is small (348 km^2), 2) The Islands were covered by volcanic products from the end of the Tertiary to the beginning of the Quaternary, though they were isolated on the Sea of Japan at the middle of the Miocene. It is, however, worth noticing that two apterous species, Acalypta sauteri and Schidium marcidum, are distributed on the Islands. The problem when and how the ancestors of these species immigrated in the Islands should be carefully elucidated on the basis of more adequate data than are now at hand.

N2  - The anophthalmic trechine beetles belonging to the group of Trechiama oni are enumerated. The twenty-three species hitherto known are classified into three subgroups, each of which is subdivided into two, three (or possibly four) and one species-complexes, respectively. They are : 1) satoui subgroup with instabilis complex (T. murakamii S. UENO and T. instabilis S. UENO) and satoui complex (T. fujiwaraorum S. UENO, T. onocoro S. UENO, T. satoui S. UENO and T. tenuis S. UENO), 2) oni subgroup with fujitai complex (T. fujitai S. UENO, T. moritai sp. nov., T. spinulifer sp. nov., T. cuspidatus sp. nov., T. crassilobatus S. UENO, T. hiurai sp. nov., and possibly T. yukikoae sp. nov.), oni complex (T. oni S. UENO), and kosugei complex (T. tangonis sp. nov., T. shuten S. UENO, T. silicicola S. UENO, T. kosugei S. UENO, T. expectatus S. UENO, T. dissitus S. UENO, T. yoshiakii S. UENO and T. notoi S. UENO), and 3) insolitus subgroup with only insolitus complex (T. insolitus S. UENO). A key is given to all these species, interrelationship between subgroups and species-complexes is discussed, and the distributional pattern of the species-group is shown. It is suggested that the three subgroups may have had independent origins in the ancestral stock of the group of T. ohshimai, but for practical taxonomic reasons, all are regarded as taking part in the group of T. oni.

N2  - Mt. Hakusan (2,702m in height), the westernmost Japanese mountain crowned with alpine vegetation, is widely separated from the Hida Mountains, by the Hida Highlands, of which the highest point is about 1,800m in altitude. We made a short collecting trip to this area on August 1st-4th, 1985,and were fortunate to collect as many as 137 species (11 families) of moths at Murodo (2,450m) and its vicinities (2,100-2,600m). In the alpine zone (above 2,100m) of Mt. Hakusan, 120 species (11 families) of moths have hitherto been recorded, and after our research 75 unrecorded species are listed in this paper. A tortricid moth of Lozotaenia kumatai OKU, one of the alpine moths in Japan defined by JINBO (1980), is newly added to the fauna of Mt. Hakusan. As shown in Table 1,alpine geometrid and noctuid moths occurring on this mountain have wide distributional ranges, and clearly show that the alpine fauna of Mt. Hakusan has a closer relationship to that of the Hida Mountains rather than to the Akaishi Mountains. It is worth noting that the Hakusan population of Anomogyna speciosa (HUBNER) is different from other Honshu populations in the markedly high ratio of the occurrence of reddish forms (nearly 90%) (see Figs. 2-4). From subalpine moths, some interesting or rare species are taken out and commented in this paper. They are : Epinotia cruciana (LINNAEUS), Crambus hachimantaiensis OKANO, Cucullia ledereri STAUDINGER and Cucullia lucifuga (DENIS et SCHIFFERMULLER).

Relative dating using the fluorine method has provisionally attributed the buman bones to the earlier Holocene or to the later Late Pleistocene. The question of the precise age is open to further inquiry.

Based on some measurements of long bones, No. 1 of the Asahi series was considered as a male, and No. 2 and No. 3,as females. In the same way, the Otake individual was considered as a male. These individuals show similarity to the Jomon people from other districts rather than to the modern Japanese of the Hokuriku district, especially in the pilastric index of the femur and the mid-shaft and platycnemic indices of the tibia.

N2  - 1. So-called hard shale of the Onnagawa Formation and its equivalents, used as a distinct lithostratigraphic unit, includes two types of siliceous rocks. One is porcelaneous rocks in association with diatomite and the other fine-grained clastic rocks. 2. Most of "hard shale" are porcelaneous and consist mainly of cristobalitic silica or cyptocrystalline quartz. And they contain a small amount of fine-grained clastics and clay minerals. Glauconite and dolomite are also included. 3. The cristobalitic silica is possibly derived from diatom frustules, because their cell walls or fragments can be frequently observed under microscope together with siliceous sponge spicules and radiolarian remains. High silica content in the porcelaneous rocks and diatomite suggests that both types of rocks have similar source of silica. 4. The porcelaneous rocks occur commonly with diatomite or diatomaceous mudstone. In some cases, the hard rocks change laterally into soft diatomite. Such lithofacies change supports that the hard rocks are also of biogenic origin, namely diatom frustules. However, the reason of such coexistence or interbedding of materials with different physical properties is unknown. Consolidation or silica phase transformation is considered to have occurred independently in each layer. 5. The porcelaneous rocks consist of three kinds of materials of different origin. One is diatom frustules. Second is terrigenous materials of fine-grained clastics and clay minerals. The last is authigenic and secondary minerals as glauconite, pyrite, dolomite, zeolites, etc. 6. The procelaneous rocks are altered equivalents of diatomaceous sediments which probably deposited under highly productive marine environment. Their accumulation corresponds to the maximum transgression related to the opening of the Sea of Japan. Hence, detailed biostratigraphic age determination of the Onnagawa Formation is of high importance to consider the Neogene tectonics in the northwest Pacific region.

N2  - More than 17 taxa of dictyostelid cellular slime molds were obtained in Mt. Chokai. Thirteen of them were identified with known species, namely, Dictyostelium brefeldianum HAGIWARA, D. crassicaule HAGIWARA, D. delicatum HAGIWARA, D.firmibasis HAGIWARA, D.implicatum HAGIWARA, D.microsporum HAGIWARA, D.minutum RAPER, D.polycarpum TRAUB, HOHL et CAVENDER, D.polycephalum RAPER, D.purpureum OLIVE, Polysphondylium candidum HAGIWARA, P.pallidum OLIVE and P.violaceum BREFELD. Identification of the other taxa has not yet been settled. From the results of investigations on the altitudinal distribution of dictyostelid cellular slime molds in Mt. Chokai, the following respects were suggested. 1. The sum total of species frequencies is between 400 and 450 in a warm-temperate forest adjacent to the temperate zone, and about 300 in a Fagus crenata forest vertically located in the upper part of the cool-temperate zone. 2. In Mt. Chokai, the Quercus mongolica var. undulatifolia forest is developed in the transitional zone between the cool-temperate zone and the subalpine zone, although this forest is vegetationally considered to be developed in the lowermost part of the subalpine zone. 3. The strong possibility exists that the upper limit of subalpine zone is coincident with the upper altitudinal limit of Polysphondylium species set by the climatic factor.

N2  - Distribution of some popular and weedy plants in Akita prefecture, north Honshu, was investigated by means of questionaire distributed to local botanists as well as by the field observation of the author. Fifteen target species were selected from the point that they are easily identified by any person regardless of his or her botanical background. The information of filled questionaire was transfered to a data file of mini-computer (TOSBAC40C) through Japanese-language word-processor (OASYS 100) after dueprocess. A FORTRAN program KENMAP was prepared to produce prefecture-wise distribution map with line-printer. It offers speedy and continuous but less detailed output of distribution maps substituting more clear but slow XY-protter output by KLIPS (KANAI 1976,1979). Of total 15 species, Polygonum cuspidatum, Plantago asiatica, Humulus japonicus, Geranium nepalense, Trifolium repens, Petasites japonicus, Macleaya cordata, Commelina communis and Houttuynia cordata are quite popular over the prefecture. Distribution of Trifolium repens is artificial as the species is utilized as pasture and ground cover. Macleaya cordata seems to be absent from coast region. Veronica persica, Cayratia japonica, Portulaca oleracea, Capsella bursa-pastoris and Indigofera pseudo-tinctoria are less popular and restricted to plain region. Especially, the lattermost species is nearly restricted to coast region.

N2  - A benthic survey was carried out around the Oga Peninsula, Northeast Japan, by dredging in depths from 19 to 10 1m; the attached organisms on immersed basket at Toga were also collected by hand. Oga Peninsula is influenced by the Tsushima Current, branched from the warm Kuroshio Current in summer; however, in the winter the Tsushima Current is suppressed by the cold Liman Current. So that, the sea-surface temperatures around the Oga Peninsula are 25℃ in summer and 7℃ in winter. This report deals with species of the Serpulinae only. Twenty species in 12 genera were recognized; all are already reported from various localities in the Japanese watres. The regional distributions of these serpulids found in the Japanese water to the Micronesian areas are shown in table 3. From this data, serpulids around the Oga Peninsula are also found from Cape Shionomisaki, the Kii Peninsula, which is always washed by the Kuroshio Current (mean sea-surface temperature is 27℃). Based on this investigation, serpulides distributed in the warm waters are found throughout around the Oga Peninsula.

N2  - The backbone range of northeast Honshu extends almost north to south from Mt.Hakkoda in Aomori Pref.in the north to Mt. Bandai in Fukushima Pref. in the south, forming the central mountain range of northern Honshu (Fig.1). Despite it occupies a very wide area, there have been a few recent investigations on the birds of this mountain range. Mt. Yakeishi is situated in about the middle of the mountain range and has an elevation of 1,548m (Fig.2). The lower parts of the mountain, especially those of its southeastern side, are covered with well-grown original beech forests up to about 1,000m alt. Deciduous shrubs and alpine meadows dominate above it. It is rather characteristic of the mountains of the backbone range that the deciduous shrubs replace the subalpine conifers. My field work on Mt. Yakeishi was conducted on July 11-17,29-30,1982 and July 22-24,1983. The numbers of birds that were seen or heard during the field work were given in Table 1. Since these numbers are the maximum numbers of each species recorded in any one census, they are only indicative of relative abundance of the species in particular sections. The species most frequently encountered in the upper shrub and alpine meadow zone were Anthus hodgsoni, Prunella rubida, Cettia diphone, Phylloscopus borealis, and Pyrrhula pyrrhula.

N2  - Ten demes of Dymecodon TRUE, 1886 from central and northern Honshu, Japan, were examined, on the basis of variations of tail, manus cum unguis, hind foot cum unguis and mandible lengths. Quadrilaterals composed of four mean values of these characters are smaller in northern demes than in southern demes. In the demes of central Honshu, means of mandible and tail lengths show a clear correlation with the latitudes of their collecting sites. The regression lines of the demes examined are shown by the formulae : Tail length : Yc=124.38-2.36Xmm, Sys=0.692mm, r=-0.864 Mandible length : Yc=33.2-0.54Xmm, Sys=0.188mm, r=-0.895 The mean values of tail and mandible lengths of the three demes examined in northern Honshu are not contained in the range of Yc±3 Sys of central Honshu populations, in which 99.7 percent of Yc of the same group may be contained. Therefore, the northern Honshu populations of Dymecodon taxonomically different from those of central Honshu, Japan.

N2  - The Backbone Range, a site of the initial volcanism, played an important role in the geologic development of the Green Tuff Region in Northeast Japan. Birth of the Creen Tuff Region was preceeded by acidic igneous activities through the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene. Thinning and stretching of the thick crust formed by the Oshima orogenic movement were succeeded through this acidic igneous activities. Separation of the Japanese Islands from the Asiatic Continent started simultaneously with this activities. The stage of thinning and streching of crust (120-22.5Ma), here proposed, is also intimately related to the opening of the Sea of Japan, althougn the area did not submerged yet under the sea. Close to the terminal stage of the thinning and stretching of crust, the initial volcanism of intermediate nature commenced in the Green Tuff Region, and was followed by a rapid subsidence of the area parallel to the Backbone Range of today. The pre-rifting stage (22.5-15Ma) is represented by the time of the initial volcanism and of acumulation of thick sequence of green tuff in and around the Backbone Range. Then, it was followed again by maximum subsidence indicated by a thick accumulation of monotonous siliceous or hard shale accompanied with extrusion of basalt and dolerite in the region of the Dewa hill. Extrusion of basalt and dolerite marks the rifting stage (15-10Ma) of eventually thinned and stretched underlying crust. Deformation of the Green Tuff Region took place after the Late Miocene differentiation stage under the compressional stress condition. Uplift of the Backbone range was completed through the dacitic volcanic activities accompanied with caldron collapse through Late Miocene to Plio-Pleistocene. Late Pleistocene to Recent neo-volcanisms genetically related with subduction of the Pacific plate were superimposed the Backbone Range formed during Neogene time.

N2  - The lower Neogene volcanogenic rock sequences, so-called green tuff, in the Dewa Mountains of Akita Prefecture were divided into the following five formations; the Yuno-sawagawa, Okachigawa, Iizawa-Saragawa, Daisenyama-Hatamura, and the Sugota For-mations in ascending order. Although the Nozoki and Yokonetoge Formations were used formerly for the volcanic rocks of Palaeogene to early Middle Miocene in Akita Prefecture, they are subdivided into the formations mentioned above (except the Sugota Formation) in this paper. The volcanogenic rocks of the Late Cretaceous to the early Middle Miocene in the Akita-Yamagata area were divided into five groups (I-V) based on their correlation. The group I (Late Cretaceous), II (Palaeognee) and III (Early Miocene) are terrestrial acid pyroclastic rocks occurring exclusively in the coastal and mountain areas along the Japan Sea. They have not been found in the Ou Backbone Range. The group IV (Early Miocene) and V (early Middle Miocene) consist mainly of andesitic to basaltic rocks with similar lithofacies and occur widely in the Akita-Yamagata area. Judging from the mode of occurrence of volcanic rocks, the volcanisms seem to have been terrestrial from Late Cretaceous to Early Miocone and subsequemly shifted into the subaqueous ones at the later stage of Early Miocene. The marine transgression in the early stage of Middle Miocene submerged many parts of the area.

N2  - The diatoms in twelve sampes from diatomaceous deposits of Pliocene Yamada Formation are examined. The deposits are lithologically divided into laminated and massive mudstone in ascending order. The laminated mudstone is composed of alternating lightcolored (rich in diatom frustules) and dark-colored (rich in organic and inorganic detritus) laminae. The massive one mostly consists of diatom frustules and terrigenous material. In almost all samples, frustules of Thalassionema nitzschioides constitute over 30 percent of the individual frustules. T. nitzschioides, Thalassiosira antiqua, Nitzschia sp. A, Actinoptychus undulatus, Cocconeis costata, Fragilaria construens, Rhaphoneis margaritalimbata, Rhaphoneis surirella together constitue about 60-90 percent of the diatom frustules by number. Three different associations of diatom species can be distinguished in the samples. They are, from the lower part upward, T. nitzschioides-T. antiqua in the lower part, T. nitzschioides-N. sp. A in the middle part, and T. nitzschioides-C. costata-F. construens-R. margaritalimbata-R. surirella in the upper part. The common occurrence of coastal water forms such as A. undulatus, R. margaritalimbata, R. surirella in the massive mudstone is probably ascribed to an increased influence of low saline coastal water to the production area. In the middle part of the laminated mudstone, conspicuous difference in the diatom assemblages can be detected between the light-and dark-colored laminae. Frustules of N. sp. A are abundant in the light-colored laminae where they make up 20-80 per cent of the frustules. N.sp. A also occurs in the dark-colored laminae but T. nitzschioides, A. undulatus, R. margaritalimbata and R. surirella are the dominant or common forms. The differences in the diatom flora and in the amount of terrigenous material between the light- and dark-colored laminae, which alternate each other, are the results of the quantitative differences of river supply.

N2  - Many typologies on the distribution pattern of the Japanese vascular plants have been proposed by various authors based on considaration of the distribution maps. In this paper, I newly propose 'Gleichenia japonica type' and 'Cleichenia japonica line' as an indicator of the distribution pattern and a border line with the distribution of the warm temperate species in Japan, based on considaration of the distribution of Dicranopteris pedata, Gleichenia japonica, Microlepia marginata, Sphenomeris chinensis, Ceratopteris thalictroides, Plagiogyria cuphlebia, P. japonica, Cyclosorus acuminatus, Diplazium chinense, D. nipponicum Polystichum polyblepharum, p. tsus-simense, p. tsus-simense var. mayebarae, Thelypteris laxa, T. torresiana var. calvata, T. viridifrons, and Lemmaphyllum microphyllum, etc. This type and line well agree with 95°of the warm index (cf. Fig. 3) and with the distribution map of evergreen broad-leaved forest in Japan (SUZUKI 1982).

N2  - Oribatid fauna in alpine zone of the Backbone Range in Northeast Japan was investigated and compared with that of the Mountains in Centra1 Japan.General features of oribatid fauna in the alpine zone are : (1) the small total number of species, (2) the largenumber of species of the family Ceratozetidae, (3) high frequency of the two ubiquitous species, Oppiella nova and Tectocepheus, velatus, (4) the presence of some species mostly restricted to the alpine zone such as Camisia biverrucata Achipteria alpestris and Trichoribates rausensis, (5) scarcity of Rhysotritia ardua which is one of the most common species below the alpine zone. The younger volcanoes (Mt. Zao and Mt. Issaikyo) have poorer oribatid fauna and fewer species of the family Ceratozetidae in comparison to the old volcano (Mt. Nishi-Azuma) or non-volcanic mountains (Mt. Asahi and Mt. Iide).

N2  - The geographical variation, distribution and the biology of the four Japanese species of the genus Acalypta, sauteri, hirashimai, miyamotoi and tsurugisana, are discussed based on the materials with these data from 70 localities shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The geographical variation is observed in such morphological characters as the body size, coloration, shape of paranota and costal areas, and so on, in each species excepting hirashimai which was collected from only two localities. It is a delicate problem if some of these variations can be recognized as new taxonomic status. The author prefers to defer in drawing final conclusion of this problem until many more specimens are available from various localities. The local variation seems to have been resulted from very low dispersal activity of the Japanese Acalypta. All of them produce only brachypterous form and live in the colony of mosses almost through their life. Acalypta hirashimai is confined in Hokkaido and is the only representative of the genus there. Of the other three species, whose ranges overlap one another, sauteri is apparently predominant. The remaining two, miyamotoi and tsurugisana, are found in several places between 32°40′and 35°N. As the three species occur at every altitude from lowlands to the cold-temperate zone around 34°N, there is no conspicuous difference between them in the adaptability for temperature. Besides, their distributional ranges may not be controlled by their food habits as will be noted below. On the other hand, different species do not coexist on the same colony of mosses but is allopatric at least altitudinally, as is the case on Mt. Tsurugi and Mt. Amagi. These facts seem to suggest that their distributional pattern may have been formed through competition for their habitats. It is probable that sauteri is the most predominant species for this competition, followed by miyamotoi, and lastly by tsurugisana. This will furnish an important clue for pursuing the systematic relationship between the Acalypta species. The host plants of each species of Acalypta are listed. These tingids are not rigid in selecting host mosses, because sauteri feeds on 13 species belonging to 8 families. As almost all these mosses are common widespread species, the distribution of Acalypta seems not to be delimited by their food habits. The life history of the Japanese species of Acalypta is partially reconstructed from the collecting data of adults and nymphs shown in Fig. 3. Though the data are not sufficient except for sauteri, these lacebugs are considered to be univoltine and to hibernate in the adult stage.

N2  - Antivaleria viridimacula (GRAESER), a medium-sized noctuid moth having deepgreen markings on the forewing, is one of the commonest autumnal fliers and widely distributed in all the main islands of Japan. Of this beautiful moth, a remarkable melanic form was discovered in the northern part of the Tohoku District. Melanic individuals have dark brown coloration instead of the green maculations of the typical form (Figs. 1-9). For clarifying the distribution and abundance, inquiries were made to the members of the Japan Heterocerists' Society, and 32 persons answered it. Judging from the collecting data, directly checked by myself, and from the answers to the inquiries, the following interesting facts were revealed : 1) the melanic form is found in Hakodate (southern end of Hokkaido), Aomori Pref., Akita Pref., Iwate Pref. and Gunma Pref.; 2) its maximum frequency seems to be about 50 percent in the northern part of Akita Pref.; 3) in Aomori Pref., the frequency of the occurrence of the melanicform is considered to be 2-20 percent; 4) four melanic specimens were collected in Iwate Pref., and the single melanic one was captured at Hakodate and Gunma Pref., respectively. See Fig. 10. On the other hand, six melanic individuals of the autumnal noctuid moth, Daseochaeta viridis (LEECH), were also collected in the northern part of Akita Prefecture.They show a gradation in the degree of melanism (Figs. 11-19). It is worth noting that the melanic specimens were collected only in 1975.

N2  - Although the Izu Peninsula is presently annexed to Honshu, it is not placed on the Eurasian plate but the Philippine Sea plate. To the northward of the Izu Peninsula, the South Fossa Magna folded belt is developed along the boundary between above two plates. The belt has different stratigraphy and geologic structure of the Tertiary to Quaternary from those of adjacent areas, particularly of the Izu Peninsula. The structural characteristics of the South Fossa Magna folded belt are the intense deformation and compression forming a northward-convexing structure and those of the Izu Peninsula are a a blockwise faulting. This is consistent with the idea that the Izu Peninsula collided against Honshu in early Quaternary. There is a theory that the Izu-Mariana Arc had shifted eastward from the south of Kyushu to the present position during the period of 30 Ma-15 Ma, but it is more probable that the arc has been situated at the present position relative to Honshu and had been moving northward to subduct beneath Honshu during that period, and later, until the Izu Peninsula collided against Honshu and annexed to it in early Quaternary, when a marine sedimentary belt between the Izu Peninsula and Honshu was emerged.

N2  - Paleomagnetic measurement was made on the volcanic and pyroclastic rocks named as the Nishina Group and the"Shirahama Group"stratigraphically distributed in the Matsuzaki area, western part of the Izu Peninsula. The intensities of natural remanent magnetization, and the ratios of the intensity of natural remanent magnetization to the intensity of remanent magnetization after alternating field demagnetization, are related to the lithology of samples. The mean of the measured paleomagnetic inclinations of the upper"Shirahama Group"(I=48.7°) is nearly the same as that of the present time. But the mean of the measured paleomagnetic inclinations of the lower Nishina Group (I=27.8°) is shallower than that of the present time. The mean of the measured paleomagnetic declinations of both the Nishina Group and the"Shirahama Group"are nearly the same as that of the present time. This indicates that there has been no tectonic rotation of large scale in the studied area.

N2  - 1. Jaishi volcano was constructed through successively repeated eruptions mainly of andesite lava flows. Such volcanism (polygenetic eruptive episodes, unimodal chemistry and petrography of volcanics, lava flow eruptions), as well as in Daruma, Ida and Tenshi volcanoes in the southwestern part of the Izu Peninsula, differs markedly from those of Higashi-Izu monogenetic volcanoes, (ARAMAKI & HAMURO, 1977; HAMURO, 1978), yielding chiefly pyroclastics of basalt and dacite. 2. Major element chmistry of the lavasa shows slight decreases of MgO, CaO and ΣFeO, and increase of SiO_2 as eruption order, but the ranges of the chemical variations are not wide. This is suggestive of insufficient differentiation in a magma chamber and successive eruption within a short term.

N2  - The fossil lake of Oshino, northeast of Mt. Fuji, was caused by damming up of the Oshino lava, a basaltic lava flow of My. Fuji Volcano. The lake deposits of Oshino, about 11-12m in thickness, lie at a depth of 12-25m and dated 7,150±140 years B. P. by the ^<14>C method. The geological sequence in and around the Oshino basin and the pollen flora and the insect fauna of the deposits are reported in another paper in this volume. Forty-five species of fossil diatom are identified, and the most dominant species among them is Stephanodiscus dubius which has not yet been reported from recent lakes in Japan. Other planctonic species include Cyclotella comta, Fragilaria construens, Melosia granulata, Stephanodiscus astrara and Tabellaria fenestrata. Other spiecies are all epiphytic and occupy less than 10% of total individuals.

N2  - It is said that the form-genus Trichoderma and its allies include the species antagonistic to the growth of shiitake mushrooms [Lentinus edodes (BERK.) SING.]. It is also said that those species or a limited species of them often darken the chip-spawns (buried log-pieces with inhabiting mycelia of L. edodes, as innocula), and barks as well as surface of sap-woods under barks of bed-logs. Although some Trichoderma strains are considered to inhabit in the darkened portions, usually neither conidial colonies nor stroma of their Hypocrea states is found. The author considered the darkened portion of shiitake bed-logs as an appropriate material to search for a method to isolate Trichoderma strains and identify them at the species level. Three samples of the darkened portion from different bed-logs were collected from the Izu Peninsula, central Japan, and strains of Trichoderma or its allies were tried to isolate from them. Seven strains were isolated from the three samples. The isolated strains were compared with the strains cultured from already-identified Hypocrea species to identify them at the species level. As a result, the anamorphs of Hypocrea nigricans (IMAI) DOI and H. muroiana HINO et KATSUMOTO were found from all the samples. The other two strains were isolated from only one sample. They were not identified at the species level at present, but they were identified as Trichoderma hamatum (BON.) BAIN. aggr., and T. harzianum RIFAI agger., respectively, after RIFAI's classification of the genus Trichoderma. Discussions are also made on an isolation method of Trichoderma and its allies from a substrate without missing any different strains, and a method to identify Trichoderma strains at the species level.

N2  - Fuji Goko (or Fuji Five Lakes) are located in the northern skirt of Mt. Fuji. The area is situated at the northernmost part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Part and is one of the most famous mountain resorts of this country. The five lakes consist of Yamanaka-ko, Kawaguchi-ko, Sai-ko, Shoji-ko and Motosu-ko lying from east to west. Among these waters, Kawaguchi-ko has the lowest surface level, that is 830 meters above sea level, and Yamanaka-ko the highest at 982 meters. Field surveys were in August, 1980 and in March, May, August and October, 1981. Most materials were collected with a plankton net and were fixed with formalin or glutharaldehyde. The fixed specimens are deposited in the herbarium of the National Science Museum, Tsukuba Botanical Garden (TNS). The materials are partly maintained in a culture room for further studies. Among the 240 taxa of phytoplankton enumerated in Table 1,197 taxa are newly added to the algal flora of Fuji Goko. The number of taxa discovered in each lake is : 142 in Shoji-ko; 119 in Kawaguchi-ko; 96 in Yamanaka-ko; 82 in Sai-ko and 47 in Motosuko (Table 1,2). In the case of Yamanaka-ko, the relative number of diatom taxa to a total number of algae is considerably small and the relative number of euglenophycean and chlorophycean algae is large. Most of those eugleno-and chlorophycean algae, however, were found only in materials collected in a shallow water near Misaki camp site on the northern shore of the lake. Descriptions of each taxon and some taxonomic notes will be given elsewhere in the other paper.

N2  - Marine benthic flora of the Izu Peninsula has been studied by ENDO (1935), SEGAWA (1935,1936,1938,1941) and CHIHARA (1967). From the results of the present study and the data available at the present time, it is known that there are 413 species of marine algae occurring in this area. Of these algae, 63 species belong to the Chlorophyceae, 80 species to the Phaeophyceae and 270 species to the Rhodophyceae. For the purpose of understanding the characteristics of the marine flora of the Izu Peninsula, it is compared with the floras of some other regions along the Pacific coast of Japan, by using various indexes, such as C/P ration, I/H ration, the number of species of the genus Sargassum and the subfamily Ecklonioideae, and the number of common species examined for the benthic species of the Chlorophyceae and Phaeophyceae. As a result, it is considered that the Izu Peninsula has a marine flora represented by warm temperate elements, having much similarities to the warmer regions, such as the Boso Peninsula and the Kii Peninsula.

N2  - Sixteen species and one variety of the family Aspleniaceae are recorded from the Izu Peninsula : Asplenium capillipes, A. incisum, A. normale, A. normale var. boreale, A. obliquissimum, A. pekinense, A. prolongatum, A. ritoense, A. ruprechtii, A. sarelii, A. scolopendrium, A. tichomanes, A. tripteropus, A. unilaterale, A. varians, A. wilfordii, and A wrightii. Among them, the most common species in this region is Asplenium incisum; the rarest are A. capillipes, A. normale var. boreale, and A. obliquissimum. The others can be classified from common to rare as follows based on the frequency of locality of each species : A. incisum>A. sarelii>A. varians>A. unilaterale>A. trichomanes=A. tripteropus>A. normale>A. wilfordii>A. wrightii>A. pekinense>A. prolongatum<A. scolopendrium>A. ruptechtii>A. capillipes=A. nomale var. boreale=A. obliquissimum. This order is not unique to the Izu Peninsula : the same frequency is observed in other regions. The Aspleniaceae flora of the Izu Peninsula is composed of (1) tropical and subtropical species such as Asplenium unilaterale, (2) warm temperate species such as A. capillipes, A. incisum, A. normale, A. normale var. boreale, A. obliquissimum, A. pekinense, A. prolongatum, A. ritoense, A. ruprechtii, A. sarelii, A. trichomanes, A. tripteropus, A. varians, A. wilfordii, and A. wrightii, and (3) temperate species such as A. scolopendrium. There is no species endemic to this region. Among the warm temperate species, the following show the Sohayaki type of distribution pattern : Asplenium obliquissimum, A. prolongatum, A. ritoense, A. wilfordii, and A. wrightii.

N2  - 1. Twenty one populations of Aconitum from Mt. Fuji of Central Japan have been studied with the aim to determine the taxonomic status of"A. isidzukae". Structure of each population has also been preliminarily reported in this paper. Locality of each population is given in Table 1 and Figure1. 2."A. isidzukae"was formerly treated as a distinct species, being inhabited exclusively in stony places of Mt. Fuji, characterized by having erect stem and straight and spreading hairs on stem and leaf. But these traits should not be regarded to characterize specifically the plant in question because they are also found in individuals which indoubtedly belong to A. senanense. On the other hand, the aconite from Osawa differs from A. senanense in having much branched stem and a wide range of variation of stamen pubescence. So it seems more appropriate to treat the aconite from Osawa as a variety of A. senanense : Aconitum senanense Nakai subsp. senanense var. isidzukae (NAKAI) KADOTA stat. nov. A. senanense ssp. senanense var. isidzukae is presumed to be a taxon, which has differentiated from the polymorphic species A. senanense in relatively recent days at the alpine zone of Mt. Fuji. This aconite falls in the category of the Fuji-Hakone Elements (HARA, 1959). 3. It becomes clear that the aconite populations of Mt. Fuji are very complicated. Population 15(Fig. 1) is composed of A. senanense ssp. senanense var. isidzukae, A. napiforme ssp. montanum var. montanum and their intermediates, and the populations around Osawa (Fig. 1,1-14) consist of A. senanense ssp. senanense var. isidzukae and the intermediate forms (Fig. 4). Furthermore, population 18 (Mt. Kyogatake, 2,320m) includes A. grossedentatum, the above-mentioned taxa, and their intermediate forms which can be divided into four kinds (Fig. 5). These intermediates are presumed to be products of introgressive hybridization between the related taxa. A similar situation has been observed in the A. senanense-micranthum complex from the Akaishi Mountain Range (KADOTA, 1981). It is supposed that the occurrence of such a complicated composition of the populations of Mt. Fuji may be relevant to frequent volcanic activities of the mountain : the alpine vegetation of Mt. Fuji holding the Aconitum habitats might have been completely destroyed by a previous volcanic activity; next, in the course of regeneration of vegetation, invasion of teh taxa which have inhabited in the northern ranges (Tenshi-Misaka-Doshi-Tanzawa Ranges, Fig. 6) of older origin into Mt. Fuji might have taken place; subsequently, introgressive hybridization might have occurred between the taxa.

N2  - By the courtesy of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan the authors had a good chance to re-examine the paratype of Sympasiphaea imperialis TERAO, 1922,which is preserved in the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household. The paratype, 183mm in body length and 79mm in carapace length, is really important, since the holotype was destroyed by the Kanto Earthquake of 1923. Some years ago the authors also re-examined the male and the ovigerous female abtained by trawlnet at the depth of about 360m in Suruga Bay and recorded by KURODA (1973). In the present paper the authors recorded a male (175mm in body length and 74.5mm in carapace length including rostrum), a female (185 and 80mm) and an ovigerous female (175 and 77mm) (NSMT-Cr 8163) from Suruga Bay, which are preserved in the National Science Museum, Tokyo, and one specimen (SMBS 70001; 85mm in carapace length including rostrum) in the old collection of the Shimoda Marine Biological Station, the University of Tsukuba. The exact locality of the last specimen is unknown, but it is highly probably that it came from the depths of Sagami Bay. The examination of a total of six specimens revealed that the armature of the dorsal carina of the carapace extending back from the rostrum is considerably variable and that the other differences from the type-species of the genus, S. annectens ALCOCK, 1901,from the Arabian Sea are not specific, but are apparently within the individual variation. On the other hand, from the Japan Marine Fishery Resource Research Center the authors received for identification many kinds of shrimps collected from the depths off Surinam on the northeast coast of South America. Among them are more than sixty specimens identified as Glyphus marsupialis FILHOL, 1884,which has hitherto been restricted to the East Atlantic and extensively re-described with fine figures by CROSNIER and FOREST (1973). They questioned the validity of the genus Sympasiphaea and its representative S. annectens. Thus it is quite fortunate that the authors could compare directly the specimens identified as Sympasiphaea from Japan and Glyphus from the West Atlantic. As a result of the close comparison it must be pointed out that the French authors were correct in considering both are synonymous and that Glyphus marsupialis has the priority generically and specifically over Sympasiphaea annectens.

N2  - Interrelationships of eight demes of Urotrichus hondonis consisting of 110 specimens from the Izu Peninsula were studied taxononomically (Table 1). A smaller, a larger, and an intermediate forms were recognized among them. The smaller form, the Amagi group, with a relatively long tail, distinctly smaller body, and slightly shorter mandible, is confined to a mountainous region in the northern part of Mt. Amagi. On the other hand, the larger form, the Omuro-Shimoda group, with shorter tail, relatively large body, and slightly longer mandible, is found mainly in lowlands extending from the northeastern part through the southeastern district to the southwestern part of the Izu Peninsula. The phenetic differences between these two groups are very clear, because the mean values with twice the standard error in the length of body and mandible of II, III, and IV of the Amagi group are much smaller than the range of Yc±2Sys of the Omuro-Shimoda group, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Although there is an intermediate form containing demes V and VI, the Amagi and the Omuro-Shimoda groups are considered to be different taxa which differ in the time of distributional expansion following their emergence. Among them, the Amagi group may be an earlier and more primitive form than the Omuro-Shimoda group and may have been dispersed from the lowlands of the Izu Peninsula by the latter.

N2  - The Izu Peninsula situated between both Bays Sagami and Suruga is favored by high humidity and warm temperature under the influence of the Kuroshio Current of the Pacific. The highest annual rainfall of 3,500mm was observed on the ridges of Amagi-range which traverses the central part of the peninsula from west to east. The annual mean temperature attains 16℃ in the southwestern part of the peninsula and there is no frost even in the midwinter. Mt. Manzaburo, 1,407m alt., is the highest of the range in which many peaks exceeding 1,000m alt. stretch in a row. From ca. 800m alt. up to the summit, the range is covered mainly by the temperate deciduous broad-1eaved forest dominated by Fagus crenata and Stewartia monadelpha. Moss flora of this area is characterized by the temperate Holarctic and Asiatic-holarctic elements. Representative species of them are as follows : Andreaea rupestris var. fauriei, Bartramiopsis lescurii, Boulaya mittenii, Dicranum flagellare, D. hamulosum, Haplohymenium longinerve, Hylocomium himalayanum, H. splendens, Macromitrium prolongatum, Oncophorus wahlenbergii, Pogonatum contortum, Rhytidiadelphus subpinnatus, Trachycystis flagellaris, and T. immarginata. Three main rivers, Kawazugawa, Nishinagawa and Kanogawa rise among the peaks of the range and deep valleys are formed between 200-400m alt. in their upper parts. These valleys are covered by the warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forest dominated by Shiia sieboldii, Quercus glauca, Camellia japonica, etc. Moss flora of these valleys is characterized by the Paleotropical, Subtropical and Southern Japanese elements. Representative species of them are as follows : Aerobryum speciosum var. nipponicum, Barbella enervis, Bryhnia trichomitria, Chrysocladium retrorusm, Claopodium aciculum, C. assurgens, Cyathophorella hookeriana, C. kyusyuensis, Dendrocyathophorum paradoxum, Diphyscium involutum, Distichophyllum maibarae, Duthiella flaccida, Entodon conchophyllus, Eriopus japonicus, Fissidens doii, Floribundaria aurea ssp. nipponica, Homaliodendron exiguum, Glossadelphus ogatae, Lopidium nazeense, Meteorium buchanani ssp. helminthocladulum, M. subpolytrichum, Neckera flexiramea, N. konoi, Neacroporium flagelliferum, Orthomniopsis dilatata, Pogonatum spurio-cirratum, Pseudobarbella levieri, Plagiomnium succulentum, Rhacopilum aristatum, Rhizogonium badakense, Stokesiella arbuscula, Syrrhopodon japonicus, Thamnobryum plicatulum, and Theriotia lorifolia.

N2  - Species composition of oribatid mite communities was investigated at 20 stations in beech forest of Mt. Echizen-dake (st. 1-5), Mt. Banzaburo-dake (st. 6-10), the Amagi Pass (st. 11-15) and Hakone (st. 16-20) in Central Japan. The average number of oribatid species from the twenty stations was 25.1,which was relatively low compared with the species numbers from the other types of forests in cool-temperate zone of Japan. Among 113 species found there Apolohmannia gigantea seems to have a close connection with beech forests. On the other hand, the lack of the following taxa of oribatid mites is noted as an important feature of the beech forests : Fosseremus quadripertitus, Oppia neerlandica, Machuella ventrisetosa, the families Palaeacaridae, Parhypochthoniidae, Microzetidae, Eremaeidae, Mycobatidae, the genera Camisia and Oribatella. It is noteworthy that a species of the genus Dampfiella was newly recorded from Japan, because the distribution of the family Dampfiellidae has been restricted to the tropical areas of Central-South America and Africa.

N2  - The heteropterous fauna of the Izu Peninsula protruding onto the Pacific from central Honshu, Japan, has been rather poorly known up to the present. In this paper, 132 heteropterous species, including 49 previously recorded, belonging to 31 families are listed. Though the faunal research is not sufficient yet, a brief zoogeographic discussion is made on the basis of these data. These 132 species, except for two undetermined ones, are classified into the following five groups according to the difference in their distributional patterns. Group 1 in cludes 27 species, whose ranges are limited within the Oriental Region and Japan, such as Macroscytus subaeneus, Eysarcoris ventralis, Eucorysses grandis, Scotinophara lurida, Cletus punctiger, Physopelta cincticollis, Schidium marcidum, Sirthenea flavipes, Microvelia douglasi and so on. Of these, Eucorysses grandis is the only species whose habitat seems to be closely associated with laurel forests. Most of the other species, excepting predacious ones, are very common in Japan and are more or less injurious to such cultivated crops as rice, beans and citrus. They appear to have secured their superior position in the heteropterous fauna of Japan according to the expansion of acreage under cultivation by continuous human activities. Group 2 contains 52 species distributed within the southern area of the Palaearctic Region extending from China to Japan, such as Megacopta punctatissima, Megymenum gracilicorne, Gonopsis affinis, Halyomorpha mista, Poecilocoris lewisi, Anaxandra gigantea, Urostylis westwoodi, Colpura lativentris, Anacanthocoris striicornis, Plinachtus bicoloripes, Piocoris varius, Acanthaspis cincticrus, Rhinocoris ornatus, Velinus nodipes, Hydrometra albolineata, Metrocoris histrio, Notonecta triguttata, Laccotrephes japonensis, Diplonychus japonicus and so on. Though they occur in various vegetation growing on every altitude from lowlands to the beech zone, none of them seem closely connected with laurel forests. Group 3 consists of 25 species, whose distribution is bounded within the northern part of the Palaearctic Region covering Northern Europe, Siberia, Amurland, Sakhalin and Japan, e. g., Arma custos, Carbula humerigera, Lelia decempunctata, Graphosoma rubrolineatum, Acanthosoma forficula, A. denticauda, Elasmucha putoni, Homoeocerus dilatatus, Galeatus spinifrons, Gorpis brevilineatus, Phytocoris nowickyi, Apolygus hilaris, Saldula soctica, Sigara substriata and so on. Many of them, for example Lelia decempunctata, Acanthosoma spp. and Elasmucha spp., mainly inhabit beech forests. This group seems predominant in the heteropterous fauna of the cold-temperate deciduous broadleaved forests of Japan. Group 4 comprises 23 species endemic to Japan, such as Pylorgus colon, Dimorphopterus japonicus, Geocoris proteus, Metochus abbreviatus, Aradus orientalis, Acalypta miyamnotoi, A. tsurugisana, Anthocoris miyamotoi, Onomaus lautus, Speovelia maritima, Aphelocheirus vittatus and so on. Group 5 includes 3 species, Piezodorus hybneri, Liorhyssus hyalinus and Cimex lectularis, which are either cosmopolitan or widespread. Some faunal characteristics of the Izu Peninsula are pointed out mainly based upon the pentatomoid species belonging to the first three groups in comparison with those of such areas as the Tsushima Islands (MIYAMOTO, 1970), the Kii Peninsula (TOMOKUNI, 1979), Saitama Prefecture (NOZAWA, 1978) and Niigata Prefecture (HASEGAWA, 1960) (Table 1) : A. Species of Group 1,probably the Oriental elements, are not more abundant in the Izu Peninsula than in the other areas, though they are much fewer in Niigata Prefecture. B. Species of Group 2,probably the southern Palaearctic elements, show higher percentage in the Tsushima Islands and the Izu Peninsula than in Saitama and Niigata Prefectures. On the contrary, the percentage of Group 3 species, probably the northern Palaeractic elements, is lower in the Tsushima Islands and the Izu Peninsula than in Saitama and Niigata

N2  - Mt. Fuji, the highest Japanese volcano lying on the Pacific coast of central Honshu, is deeply separated from the Akaishi Mountains (the Southern Japanese Alps) by the Fuji-gawa River, and connected with the Chichibu Mountains through the Misaka Hills (the lowest gap is about 900m in altitude). The moths collected in the subalpine zone (2,000-2,500m in altitude) of the mountain were listed by INOUE (1971,1975), and the following thirteen noctuid moths are added in this paper as new to Mt. Fuji : Acronicta leporina (LINNAEUS), Euxoa sibirica (BOISDUVAL), Agrotis segetum (DENIS et SCHIFFERMULLER), Ochropleura praecurrens (STAUDINGER), Diarsia deparca (BUTLER), Xestia semiherbida (WALKER), Peridroma saucia (HUBNER), Cuculia lucifuga (DENIS et SCHIFFERMULLER), Blepharita dubida SUGI, Feralia montana (SUGI), Apamea hampsoni SUGI, Leucapamea askoldis (OBERTHUR), Autographa nigrisigna (WALKER). Although no alpine lepidopterous insects were recorded from Mt. Fuji, nine subalpine noctuid moths are distributed on this mountain, Acronicta leporina (LINNAEUS), Euxoa islandica rossica (STAUDINGER), Diarsia nipponica OGATA, Heliophobus texturatus (ALPHERAKY), Blepharita dubida SUGI, Feralia montana (SUGI), Syngrapha ain (HOCHENWARTH), Lygephila viciae (HUBNER). It is worth noting that two of these subalpine moths are distinguishable from those occurring on other mountains of central Honshu. Feralia montana (SUGI) is restricted to central Honshu, its range being limited in that of the natural forests of the Japanese Larch, Larix reptorepis (see Fig. 1). This species is divided into two forms, the nominate pale form (Fig. 4) of the Japanese Alps and a meranic form (Fig. 3) of the Asama Mountains (SUGI, 1981). Mt. Fuji is situated much nearer to the Japanese Alps than to the Asama Mountains. However, the specimens (Fig. 2) collected on Mt. Fuji more closely resemble those of the Asama Mountains in wing maculation than those of the Japanese Alps. It is surmised that this phenomenon is due to the environmental difference of larch forests, that is, the natural larch forests on Mt. Fuji and the Asama Mountains grow on volcanic grasslands and their light condition is markedly different from the dark one on the Japanese Alps where the larches grow in deep valleys. Lygephira viciae (HOCHENWARTH) on Mt. Fuji (Fig. 5) is also different from other Japanese populations (Figs. 6&7) in its darker forewing. Heliophobus texturatus (ALPHERAKY) is very common in the subalpine zone of Mt. Fuji, but it has not been recorded from any other parts of Japan and the Far East. Some moths inhabiting dry grasslands exhibit a tendency to become sporadical in distribution in Japan, so that this species will possibly be discovered in other limited places. The noctuid fauna of the subalpine zone of Mt. Fuji closely resembles that of central Honshu. Its constituents may have invaded onto Mt. Fuji through the Misaka Hills in the glacia1 period. Judging from the absence of the alpine Lepidoptera, the Misaka Hills may have been too low to allow their disparsal onto the high volcano.

N2  - One specimen of Acentrogobius hoshinonis (TANAKA) was collected from the coast of Jogasaki, Futo, the Izu Peninsula. As information on this species is not enough, A. hoshinonis has been frequently confused with A. campbelli (JORDAN et SYNDER). Therefore, A. hoshinonis is compared with A. campbelli in such characters as several meristic characters, pit organs and sensory canals on the head. As the results, A. hoshinonis is easily distinguished from A. campbelli by the number of predorsal scales and the number of the second dorsal fin rays. On the other hand, we find that a figure of A. hoshinonis in TOMIYAMA (1936) disagrees with its description on the number of the second dorsal fin rays and that MASUDA et al. (1975) misidentified A. hoshinonis with A. pflaumi (BLEEKER).

N2  - During the collecting trip to the Izu Peninsula, central Japan (Natural History Project of the Japanese Islands) on October 9 to 18,1980,more than 100 specimens of the gobiid fish Luciogobius grandis ARAI were collected from Eno-ura (35°11'N, 139°09'E), Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Kawana (34°57'N, 139°08'E), Harai (34°54'N, 139°08'E) and the coast of Jogasaki (34°53'N, 139°08'E) of the Izu Peninsula. The present collection of such a large number is noteworthy, as the only record of this goby from Pacific coast of Japan was two specimens from Toi, the west coast of the Izu Peninsula, in 1906. Variations of several morphological characters were studied such as total vertebral number (VN), abdominal and caudal vertebral number (AV and CV), number of dorsal and anal rays, and structural morphology of anteriormost pterygiophores of dorsal and anal rays. The findings of specimens of Luciogobius platycephalus SHIOGAKI et DOTSU, L. elongatus REGAN, L. parvulus (SNYDER), L. sp. and Inu koma SNYDER in the fish collection by Mr. H. MASUDA from the coast of Jogasaki were also noteworthy. Luciogobius platycephalus is the first record from Honshu. Both of L. elongatus and L. parvulus are the first record from the Izu Peninsula. Several morphological characters of these specimens are described. Experiments for chromosome observation of L. grandis from Kawana were carried out. The diploid chromosome number of this species is 44. Squamation of Inu koma specimens from the coast of Jogasaki shows intermediate type between those of Inu ama and I. koma described by SNYDER (1909). When characters of Inu koma specimens from the coast of Jogasaki were compared with those of holotypes of Inu koma and I. ama, Inu koma cannot be differentiated from Inu ama in characters such as number of dorsal and anal rays, total vertebral number, abdominal and caudal vertebral number and others (Table 2). From above reasons, Inu ama is synonymized with Inu koma. On the other hand, DOTU (1957) erected a naked goby Luciogobius saikaiensis which is very similar to Inu koma except its scalelessness. This species was classified into Luciogobius for its scalelessness. However, scalelessness is one of the diagnostic characters of Luciogobius, but not the most important character for Luciogobius. Naked specimens have been reported in Clariger cosmurus and C. papillosus. As L. saikaiensis is more similar to Inu koma than to L. guttatus, which is closest to L. saikaiensis among species of Luciogobius, in vertebral character, body color and structural morphology of pterygiophores of dorsal and anal rays. Therefore, generic allocation of L. saikaiensis should be changed into Inu.

N2  - Detailed geological map (Fig. 1) of the Mikasa Group is shown strictly according to the lithological classification. Differing from the previous ones (e.g. MAKIYAMA, 1941; SAITO, 1960), the results well indicate the stratigraphic relationship between the component units and also are more practical for applied geology. The group is composed of the following formations in ascending order : Towata Mudstone, Matsuba Siliceous Shale, Kurami Green Tuff, and Saigo Mudstone. Two adjacent formations almost always show conformable or partly, especially around the boundary, interfingering relation and, therefore, the group comprises a single sedimentary cycle. This idea was proposed by UJIIE (1958 and others) and SAITO (1960) opposedly to MAKIYAMA's opinion. In the western part, however, the Saigo Mudstone covers the Matsuba Siliceous Shale with wavy base, above which cobbles derived from siliceous nodules are contained in muddy matrix. These nodules are characteristic in the uppermost part of the Matsuba Formation. Two benthonic formainiferal sequences are obtained from the typical sections across the northwestern wing of a main syncline. The results are summarized by generic composition change (Fig. 3) and show that the so-called arenaceous forms charcteristically predominate in the Towata, Kurami and particulary Matsuba Formations. On the other hand, the Saigo Formation contains abundant calcareous forms. Generally, however, both the types of fauna suggest similarly outer neritic to bathyal environment; there is no significant change of water depth. In Section 1,a sudden change of faunal composition can be recognized between Samples 13 and 14,which were taken respectively just below and above the mentioned unconformity. Compared with the sequence of Section 2,it seems that an interval equivalent to the lower half of the Kurami Formation was lost there, probably because of some subaqueous erosion and/or under no depositional condition judging from the lithology and the benthonic Foraminifera. SAITO (1960) denied the presence of this unconformity on the basis of his planktonic foraminiferal stratigraphy ranging continuously from N.5 to N.8 in term of BLOW's (1969) zonation scheme through the whole Mikasa Group. Since N.7 is represented only by the Kurami Formation (=Shinzakie Formation of SAITO), it becomes that the Saigo (N.8) contacts directly with the Matsuba (N.6). Re-examination of SAITO's results, therefore, suggests also the present unconformity, although it is limited in the western half of the basin.

N2  - Molluscan fauna of the Kakegawa Group on the Pacific coast of central Japan has been known as the representative of the Pliocene and the early Pleistocene subtropical faunas in the Pacific coast areas of Southwest Japan. Detailed biogeographic and ecologic analyses of the fauna, however, have not been published in spite of the popularity of the fauna. Three different types of species associations of molluscs can be distinguished in find-grained facies based on the horizontal replacement of constituent species along an isochronous T-3 tuff layer (Fig. 1). The T-3 tuff passes in the upper part of the Group through different lithofacies changes along the tuff. They are, from northwest to southeast, the Glycymeris rotunda-Venus foveolata Association in fine-grained sandstone (Ukari Formation), the Nassaria magnifica Association in coarse-grained siltstone, and the Limposis tajimae Association in fine-grained siltstone (both Hijikata Formation). The Nassaria and the Limopsis Associations are found in a siltstone tongue extending from the southeast into the sandstone area below the T-3 tuff (Fig. 2). Molluscan faunas comparable to these three associations are now living in the Pacific coast of central Japan, in the lower sublittoral, shelf edge to uppermost bathyal, and upper bathyal, respectively. A mixed assemblage of allochthonous molluscs is found in the marginal medium to coarse-grained sandstone (Dainichi Formation). It is rich in Glycymeris totomiensis, Suchium suchiense, Turritella perterebra, and other bivalves and gastropods. The assemblage is composed mainly of genera of subtidal sandy bottom dwellers intermingled with those of the intertidal and other habitats. While most of the extinct species in the Kakegawa Fauna are found in this mixed assemblage, which represents the shallowest biofacies of the Group, the constituents of the three offshore associations are mostly the species now living in the waters off central Japan.

N2  - The distribution of three Japanese leaf-mining buprestid beetles, Trachys robusta E. SAUNDERS, 1873,T. dilaticeps GEBHARDT, 1928 (=mixtipilis OBENBERGER, 1929,variolaris robustissima Y. KUROSAWA, 1959) and Habroloma kagosimanum OBENBERGER, 1940 (=shirozui Y. KUROSAWA, 1959) seems to reflect the influence of the Kuroshio Current that flows along the Pacific coast of Southwest Japan. The drifting mechanism of these leaf-mining small buprestids is very peculiar, differing from that in the case of common wood boring beetles spread along the Pacific coast. When large Castanopsis trees with thick evergreen leaves containing larvae or pupace of T. robusta or dilaticeps drift on the sea, a part of the tree, at least, may be carried for a long distance without submargence of the foliated part and may eventually result in the landing of the insects in the leaves on the coast far distant from their native country. Trachys variolaris E. SAUNDERS, 1873 (=clavicornis OBENBERGER, 1919) known from Japan, Korea and China, T.robusta E.SAUNDERS, 1873 from Japan and T. dilaticeps GEBHARDT, 1928 from China, Northern Indochina, Formosa and the Ryukyus from a distinct species-group in the genus Trachys Fabricius, 1801. In this species-group, variolaris can be considered to be the most primitive and the other two more evolved. The common ancestor of robusta and dilaticeps may have occerred somewhere in southern China or Tonkin. Its descendant became evolved to dilaticeps in the Continent, while an offshoot immigrant to western Japan across the sea became differentiated into robusta. The former species secondarily drifted to Formosa and the Ryukyus. The latter islands were, therefore, not included in the original ragne of the genus Trachys. Though the Ryukyus are considered to have been formed at the beginning of the Pleistocene (see KUROSAWA, 1974), the invasion of Trachys species into Japan seems to have taken place in a period after the Middle Pleistocene. On the other hand, in Tropical Asia, the genus Trachys reaches Celebes and Lesser Sunda Islands, whose separation from the main part of Sundaland is said to have effected during the Neogene. Judging from these data, the trend of dispersal of the genus Trachys in Asia was first directed southeastwards from the Himalayas or North Burma to Sundaland, and next eastwards to China and Japan.

N2  - The Kii Peninsula is a massive protrusion of land mass on the Pacific side of southcentral Honshu. The Ohmine Mountain range occupying the central portion of the peninsula contains a dozen of peaks higher than 1,700 m above sea level, the highest peak being Mt. Hakken-san with a hight of 1,915 m altitude. This mountain range is one of most inaccessible palces in Japan owing to the deepness and steepness of the mountains, inconvenience of transportation to their foothills, and great amount of rainfall throughout the year. The existence of a subalpine (coniferous) avifauna on the higher level of the mountains was known, but did not have been investigated until recently. Our knowledge of the birds of this region is still inadequate. We therefore conducted field work form July 20 to 23,1979 and from September 3 to 4,1979,at the highest portion of the mountain range and recorded 28 species of birds in total. Unfortunately, on both occasions, our field work suffered from bad weather and our original itinerary had to be cut short. The bird species we recorded at above 1,600 m altitude (conferous and mixed forests) are as follows : Buteo buteo, Phasianus soemmerringii, Cuculus canorus, C. poliocephalus, C. saturatus, Dendrocopos leucotus, D. kizuki, Anthus hodgsoni, Troglodytes troglodytes, Prunella rubida, Erithacus akahige, E. cyane, Tarsiger cyanurus, Cettia diphone, Phylloscopus borealis, Parus montanus, P. ater, P. major, Sitta europaea, Zosterops japonica, Garrulus glandarius. A comparison of the subalpine avifaunas of the Kii peninsula (Ohmine Mountains), Shikoku (Mt. Tsurugi and Mt. Ishizuchi) and central Honshu (Japan Alps) is give. It is noteworthy that the higher peaks in the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku possess subalpine faunas that are very similer in their species composition, differing from that on the Japan Alps in lacking several typically coniferous and alpine species such as Prunella collaris, Loxia curvirostra, Carduelis spinus, Emberiza variabilis, and Lagopus mutus. Both ecological (vegetation) and geographical (isolation) factors seem to account the impoverished subalpine avifaunas in the Kii Peninsula and Shikoku.

N2  - Thirty-one demes of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (SCHREBER, 1774) from the Kii, the Chugoku, the Tanba and the Suzuka Mountains, Honshu, Japan, were examined. The mean values of the forearm lengths of the Chugoku samples linearly correlate with the latitudes of their collecting sites. The regression line of this Chugoku group is shown by the forms : Y_c=3.28+1.61 X, Sys=0.379,γ=0.862. The mean values of the forearm lengths of the Kii demes are not contained in the range of Y_c±3Sys of the Chugoku group of R.f. nippon TEMMINCK, 1835,being larger than those of the latter. Consequently, the Kii demes remarkably differ from the Chugoku group and probably belong to the larger form of R.f. mikadoi OGNEV, 1927,which is distributed over Shikoku and the central part of Kyushu. The larger form and the Chugoku group of this species seem to occupy different areas, that is, the former is distributed on the southern side of the Median Tectonic Line of Southwest Japan and the latter on its northern side.

N2  - The zoogeography of apogonid fishes along the Coast of Shirahama, the Kii Peninsula, was investigated, with references to distribution of the family Apogonidae from Japan. Twelve genera and 52 species of Apogonidae have been recorded from Japan. The apogonid fishes distributed along the Kii Peninsula are referred to 5 genera and 22 species, occupying 42% of all the Japanese apogonids in number of species. The faunal characteristics of this family were examined at 39 localities in the area extending from Japan to adjacent seas by applying SCHENCK and KEEN's method (Fig. 2). The definition of the central latitude (C.L.) is the mean value of the northern and southern extremes of distribution range of any given species, and the geographical latitude (G.L.) is that of each locality. The biological latitude (B.L.) of each locality is the mean value of C.L. for all species found there (G.L.). The distributional index (D.I.), i.e., D.I.=G.L.-B.L., is used as the faunal characteristics of each locality. Based upon C.L., apogonids from Japan are classified into 3 groups (Table 1). The first, temperate group (Group I), contains one genus and one species, of which C.L. is north of 30°N in the northern sector of the northern Pacific. The second, subtropical group (Group II), contains 4 genera and 11 species, and its C.L. corresponds to the middle sector of the northern Pacific from 20° to 30°N. The third, tropical group (Group III), contains 9 genera, and 40 species and C.L. of this group corresponds to the southern sector of the northern Pacific, south of 20°N. The apogonid species distributed along the Coast of Shirahama, the Kii Peninsula, consist of 41 percent of the subtropical group (Group II) and 59 percent of the tropical group (Group III) (Table 1). As shown in Table 3,we calculated the coefficient of closeness between two localities by applying the method of OTUKA (1936). The coefficients of closeness between the Coast of Shirahama and Miyazaki or Koochi are larger than those between the Coast of Shirahama and the Suruga Bay or Shimoda of the Izu Peninsula. This suggests that the apogonid fauna found along the Coast of Shirahama belongs to the zoogeographical district of the middle sector of the northern Pacific. Northern limits of distribution ranges of following five species are the Coast of Shirahama, i.e., Apogon unicolor and Pseudamia amblyuropterus (GROUP II), and Apogon taeniatus, Fowleria isostigma and Cheilodipterus macrodon (Group III).

N2  - A taxonomic reexamination of the plants generally called Festuca rubra L. var. hondoensis OHWI (=Festuca hondoensis OHWI in Acta Phytotax. et Geobot., 6,p. 151,1937) was made. It was uncovered that this taxon is diploid while F. rubra var. rubra and var. pacifica distributed in Japan are hexaploid (see Table 1). Morphological observations showed that F. hondoensis and F. rubra are different in the features of awns and usually in the manner of appearance of lateral shoots. A conclusion was drawn that F. hondoensis should be revived as an independent species. Cytogeographical significance of this revived species was discussed.

N2  - The species which are distributed in the Pacific side of Japan have been called the "Omote Nihon Element." Some are widely distributed throughout the entire region, but others are usually restricted to limestone or serpentine areas, to rocky places near rivers which often overflow and to poorly nourished or dry mountain ridges. Most of the latter species have usually been called the "Sohayaki Element" which is now regarded as a remnant of one of the most ancient floras of Japan. Data were gathered from field work to observe habitats and habits of the species and from studies of specimens deposited in the herbaria of Institutum Botanicum, Academia Sinica, Peking, China (PE), the University of Tokyo (TI), Tokyo Metropolitan University (Makino Herbarium : MAK), National Science Museum, Tokyo (TNS) and Kyoto University (KYO). Approximately 50 species (cited below) are examined in this paper from taxonomic and phytogeographic points of view. Based on habitat these species can be divided into two categories. 1. Plants growing on the steep cliffs only and/or on the shelf barrens. These species, protected from extinction by the habitat, are considered to have survived for long periods of time in competition with the invaders of both glacial and interglacial periods. Tanakaea radicans FR. & SAV., which grows on steep cliffs only (Fig. 1), is a representative species of this group and has a disjunct distribution on the Pacific side of Japan, eastern Shikoku and the southern part to the Chubu district of Honshu, but absent from the Kii Peninsula. Saussurea amabalis KITAMURA shows a similar disjunct pattern of distribution and grows on shelf barrens on the Pacific side of Japan. The species cited below are also considered to be relict, growing on shelf barrenes on the Pacific side of Japan : Pseudotsuga japonica (SHIRASAWA) BEISSN.; Alectorurus yedoensis (MAXIM.) MAKINO; Tricyrtis macrantha MAXIM. and subsp. macranthopsis (MASAM.) KITAMURA and T. ishiiana (KITAGAWA & T. KOYAMA) OHWI and var. surugensis YAMAZAKI; Hosta shikokiana N. FUJITA; H. hypoleuca MURATA, H. pulchella N. FUJITA; Lilium speciosum THUNBERG; Allium togashii HARA and A. virgunculae F. MAEKAWA & KITAMURA; Saxifraga sendaica MAXIM; Wikstroemia albiflora YATABE and W. kudoii MAKINO; Gentiana yakushimensis MAKINO; Aster komonoensis MAKINO and Saussurea pennata KOIDZ. 2. Plants referred to as "rheophytes" in Japan. Rheophyted was defined by van STEENIS (1932) based on plants in tropical areas. Although the mainland of Japan is located in the warm temperate zone, several species listed here are considered to occupy habitats similar to those of tropical plants which grow on rocky shelves near rivers in the bottoms of gorges which are innundated once to several times a year. They have in common such particular features of habit as follows : perennial or shrub, mostly with slender leaves and narrow branch or branchlet angles; roots which cling to the crevices of rocks anchoring the plant body against rushing water and sprouting immediately after a flood. These plants are resistant to physical damage but grow weakly in shade. Plants of this group are as follows : Osmunda lancea TUNBERG; Allium virgunculae F. MAEKAWA var. kiiense MURATA; Hosta kikutii F. MAEKAWA. var. caput-anis (F. MAEKAWA) F. MAEKAWA and var. polyneuron (F. MAEKAWA) N. FUJITA; Arundinella hirta (THUNBERG) C. TANAKA var. riparia (HONDA) OHWI; Alnus serrulatoides CALL.; Astilbe japonica (MORR. & DECNE.) A. GRAY; Spiraea tosaensis YATABE, S. japonica L. f. var. ripensis KITAMURA and S. thunbergii L.f. ex BLUME; Indigofera decora LINDL.; Angelica tenuisecta (MAKINO) MAKINO and A. shikokiana MAKINO ex YABE; Rhododendron indicum (L.) SWEET and R. ripense MAKINO; Leptodermis pulchella YATABE; Aster sohayakiensis KOIDZ., A. tenuipes MAKINO and A. ageratoides TURCZ. subsp. ripensis (MAKINO) KITAMURA and subsp. microcephalus (MIQ.)

N2  - The results of the radiolarian analytical investigations of the Cretaceous Misakubo and the Tertiary Wada Formations exposed in the southern part of the Akaishi Mountains (Fig. 1) are reported. A radiolarian assemblage of Calocycletta virgnis Zone including such species as Cyrtocapsella cornuta, C. tetrapera, C. japonica, Stichocorys wolffii, S. delmontensis, Lychnocanoma elongata, Carpocanistrum sp., Eucyrtidium sp., and Liriospyris spp., Early Miocene species, was recognized in a part of the shale formerly assigned to the Cretaceous Misakubo Formation in the Misakubo area. By radiolarian analysis a quite similar fossil assemblage of the Early Miocene species such as Cyrtocapsella cornuta, C. tetrapera, Calocycletta virginis, Eucyrtidium sp., Spongodiscus spp., Ommatodiscus sp., and Solenophaera sp., was also confirmed in the Tertiary shale of the type localities of Wada Formation. Therefore, it is clear that a part of the strata which were assigned to the Misakubo Formation should be reasonably regarded as the Wada Formation on the basis of the radiolarian fossil evidence. These Radiolaria are shown on Plate 8. Another interesting fact is that the newly discovered Early Miocene localities are distributed in a zone extending from north to south along the border of Akaishi tectonicline (Fig. 2), although partly interrupted by the Misakubo Formation. Thus, based on the radiolarian species, it is suggested that the Akaishi tectonic-line may have formed at least after the middle of Early Miocene. Newly revised geological map (Fig. 2) is presented. A few Cretaceous radiolarian fossils such as cryoptothoracic Nassellaria were discovered in the type locality of Misakubo Formation, which may be correlated with the Upper A1bian to Lower Cenomanian Middle Formation of Goshonoura Group in Kyushu, as suggested by MATSUMOTO (1954) and MATSUMOTO and TASHIRO (1975).

N2  - The Xenocypridinae is an Asiatic subfamily of cyprinid fishes, having a specialized short dentary with lower lip for shaving substratum and peculiarly develloped massive pharyngeals with large teeth. This group is composed of 4 genera and 10 species, being distributed from Amur Basin, through the wide lowlands of China, southward to Hanoi Basin. It also occurs at Taiwan and Hainan Island, but no representative of this group is known from the Japanese Islands and the Korean Peninsula. It is, however, apparent on the basis of the fossil remains that it was the most dominant freshwater fish in Japan during the Miocene. It must be noticed at present that the Miocene representatives of this subfamily are not the same as the recent ones in their generic level. A well developed pharyngeal organ characteristic for this subfamily were represented already in the Miocene fossil forms, but no specialization is observed in their dentary mechanism. The Miocene representatives of the Xenocypridinae have been found at various lacustrine sediments in Japan, and is supposed to have luxuriantly flourished during the early half of the Miocene. On the other hand, in the continental Asia, the first appearance of Xenocypridinae was recorded from the Pliocene of Shansi, accompanied with various Chinese genera of fishes. A rich East-Asiatic freshwater fish fauna seems to have been developed thereafter in the continental area. A lot of dessociated skeletal remains (mainly of pharyngeals and their teeth) of the Xenocypridinae were discovered from the Higher Terrace deposit (Middle Pleistocene) at Yage district in north to Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture. Furthermore, several pieces of Xenocypridinae fish remains were newly obtained by the author in 1978 from the lower part of the Paleo-Biwa Group (Early to Middle Pliocene) at the east suburb of Ueno City, Mie Prefecture. These two records prove the presence of the Xenocypridinae fishes in younger geologic age in the Japanese Islands. The author described in this paper the details of the fish remains from the Pleistocene Yage and Pliocene Ueno with their occurrences and geologic horizons. The author also gave an account of the origin and developement of freshwater fish fauna in western Japan, in relation to the geological and physiographical history.

N2  - Eighty-seven species of pentatomoid bugs are recorded from the Kii Peninsula as shown in Table 1. They are distinguished into five groups according to the difference in their distributional patterns (Table 1 & Fig. 1). Group 1 contains 15 species, whose ranges are limited within the Oriental Region and Japan. Most species belonging to this group seem to have spread in relation to such cultivated crops as rice and citrus. Group 2 assembles 30 species securing in an area extending from West China to Japan. Group 3 includes 31 species distributed within a northern area covering Europe, Siberia, China and Japan. Most species of this group are not abundant in the Kii Peninsula, probably due to the environmental condition not favourable for their existence. Group 4 consists of 7 species endemic to Japan. The last group, Group 5,comprises such 4 species as are either cosmopolitan or widespread. It can be concluded that the pentatomoid fauna of the Kii Peninsula considerably differs from those of Hokkaido and the Ryukyu Islands, but that it does not show much difference from those of the other parts of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. However, the northern limit of the distributional ranges of the three species, Psamnozetes ater, Nezara viridula and Elasmucha nipponica, is marked by the Kii Peninsula, and the southern limit of those of the four species, Picromerus fuscoannulatus, Eysarcoris fabricii, E. lewisi and Menida scotti, is also marked by this peninsula. This may be the sole characteristics of the Kii Peninsula seem from its pentatomoid fauna, though they are not so conspicuous as can be expected.

N2  - Oribatid communities were investigated qualitatively at 17 stations along the ridge from the top of Mt. Senjo (3,032 m) to the Kitazawa Pass (2,040m) in the South Japanese Alps. The oribatid communities above the forest line (2,710m) were characterized by the presence of Brachychochthonius berlesei, Niphocepheus nivalis, Diapterobates sp. C, Allomycobates lichenis and Neoribates sp. C, while those below the forest line by the presence of Liacarus nitens, Carabodes rimosus, Melanozetes meridianus, Ceratozetes sp. C, etc., though the habitat areas of these 2 groups of mites were somewhat overlapped near the forest line. In spite of the difference in vegetation the oribatid communities above the forest line showed no definite difference from one another. They are however, quite different from the oribatid communities above the forest line of Mt. Fuji, having no species in common. Brachychochthonius berlesei (WILLMANN), Hermannia gibba (C.L. KOCH) and Camisia biverrucata (C.L. KOCH) were found for the first time from Japan.

N2  - By dredging altogether 43 species of 13 families were collected at the sea around Cape Shionomisaki, Kii Peninsula. The stations for dredging are shown in Figure 1,and the species obtained are listed in Table 1. Brief systematic and nomenclatural notes on some species are given. 1) Arcania pulcherrima HASWELL is new to Japan, and a juvenile specimen from the Izu Islands recorded by TAKEDA (1978) as an Arcania species is conspecific with it. 2) Arcania undecimspinosa elongata YOKOYA is elevated to a specific rank following CAMPBELL (1971), since some important differences including the shape of the first male pleopod from A. undecimspinosa DE HAAN are constant. 3) Arcania septemspinosa var. gracilis HENDERSON has the priority against A. quinquespinosa ALCOCK et ANDERSON, and thus A. gracilis HENDERSON must be used. 4) The validity of Leucosia insularis TAKEDA et KURATA is discussed on the direct comparison with the specimen referable to L. sagamiensis SAKAI. As pointed in the original description the contour of the carapace is different from each other in the two species. 5) The true systematic position of Achaeus galatheae GRIFFIN from the Coral Sea may be in Prosphorachaeus erected by TAKFEDA & MIYAKE (1969) to accomodate A. suluensis (RATHBUN) from the Philippines and Japan. The crabs dredged up from the sea west of Cape Schionomisaki made by the staff of the Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, are also recorded. They are enumerated in page 155,being identified as 28 species of 9 families. It is remarkable, but not surprising that the species common to the both collections are only 10,and in the latter collection the swimming crabs are richly represented. This fact may be due to the difference in the type of the gears. It is readily understood that the crabs obtained are distributed in the sea in connection with the substratum. In other words the microhabitat of each species is obviously restricted by the substratum. St. 1-5,11-17 are, represented by fine sand bottom, being dominantly inhabited by the pebble or nut crabs, especially Pseudophilyra tridentata MIERS, and the swimming crabs. St. 12 is chiefly represented by the xanthid crabs, the substratum being the stony or rather rocky. The dredging operation was unfortunately impossible at the stalions nearer the cape. St. 19-21 are in the passage between the cape and O-shima Island. The dredging is also very difficult, but it is fortunate that some interesting spider crabs entangled with sea fan were obtained. St. 6-10,18 are represented by soft muddy bottom, with the inhabitants of the so-called blind crabs of the Goneplacidae.

N2  - From the studies of OKAMURA (1934), YAMADA (1959) and YAMAMOT0 (1957,1966), 375 species of marine benthic algae were known to occur along the coast of Kii Peninsula. Of these algae, 60 species belong to the Chlorophyceae, 79 to the Phaeophyceae and 236 to the Rhodophyceae. The author has made algal collectings at seven points in this region in April, 1978. The growing belts of intertidal benthic algae are observed in Kii Peninsula region as follows, from high tide to low tide water levels : Porphyra spp., Monostroma nitidum, Gloiopeltis furcata, Gloiopeltis tenax, Myelophycus simplex, Carpopeltis flabellata, Sargassum thunbergii, Hizikia fusiformis, Gigartina intermedia and Sargassum nipponicum. On the basis of the floristic similarities examined by the present author for the benthic species of the Chlorophyceae and the Phaeophyceae, the Pacific coast of Japan and the adjacent area may be divided into the following four phytogeographic regions : (1) from Shumushu Island to Tsugaru strait, (2) from Tsugaru strait to Choshi Peninsula, (3) from Boso Peninsula to Bungo strait and (4) Bungo strait to Yonakuni Island. Kii Peninsula belong to the region (3), which is situated in a warm temperate region.

N2  - Sampling of surface sediments were tried at 65 stations in the shallow water west off Chichi-jima, Bonin Islands (Figure 1). The island is located at about 1,000 km south of Tokyo and at the middle of the west Pacific central water. Because of oceanic and subtropical circumstance Chichi-jima is almost fringed with coral reef. Grain-size analysis was carried out on 51 samples utilizing Emery tube and the pipette method. The results are summarized in the relationship between their Mdφ- and αφ-values (Figure 2), where three groups, α, β and γ, can be recognized. Significance of their separation is also ascertained by two ellipses of rejection with 95 percent confidence for α group and β group. α group with very coarse- to coarse-grained Mdφ and with fine skewed mode seems to be located at places under strong turbulence of water so that scouring fractions around 2φ might be expected there. On the other hand, β group is composed of majority of the samples, having Mdφ of medium- to fine-grained sand size and not biased mode of size-frequency distribution. Mdφ of γ group is restricted in very fine-grained sand to silt, and fine skewed mode gives us more muddy impression compared with values of Mdφ. The muddy sediments are exclusively distributed in deep of such an inlet incised as bay of Futami Port. When we treat β and γ groups as a whole, a positive correlation is observed between Mdφ and αφ as suggested by a line drawn through the least square method in Figure 2 or by such a correlation coefficient as 0.719. Sand-grain analysis on 25 samples is based upon the determination and counting of 200-odd total number of grains for each sample under microscope. The grains are separated into six components, i.e. molluscan fragments (m in Figure 3), foraminiferal shells (f), octocoral spicules (c), echinoid spines and fragments (e), ostracod carapaces (o), and rock and mineral fragments (r). The results are summarized as a cumulative percentage diagram and a dendrogram in Figure 3. The dendrogram is obtained by the cluster analysis of the correlation coefficient matrix composed of 300 coefficients between station and station based upon percentages of the above-mentioned six components. Four clusters, A through D, can objectively be identified. As shown in Figure 2 D cluster corresponds to γ group of grain-size analysis, A cluster approximately to β group, and B cluster also approximately to α group, although these corerlations should be ascertained by augmented data of sand-grain analysis. We tentatively conclude that the sediments represented by β group and A cluster are most broadly distributed and most typical in shallow water of this area, whereas the inletdeep sediments in Futami Port bay characterized by γ group and D cluster may have been produced by derivation of non-biogenic clastics from the surrounding land areas and by displacement of molluscan fragments from the surrounding shallower waters. Another type of sediments belonged t γ group and B cluster will sufficiently be interpreted in the near future after analysis of the remained samples, more detailed analysis of size-frequency mode for this group, and benthonic foraminiferal analysis are completed.

N2  - Altogether 52 species of 38 genera of crabs were collected by dredging at the depths of 16-96 m off Nii-jima and O-shima in the Izu Islands. They are listed in Table 1. Most of them are systematically rather well known, but some rare or new species are included in the collection. Of 47 species definitely identified at present 25 are new to Izu Islands, but 41 have hitherto been recorded from Sagami Bay. Most of the species recorded at present are the so-called continenetal species, being known from the Asiatic coast along the Kuroshiwo Current, and in reality no oceanic species was found. It seems to be largely due to the shallow water species not found intertidally. The biogeographical study revealed that 47 species definitely identified are composed of 18 endemic, 8 West Pacific, 19 Indo-West Pacific, and 2 cosmopolitan species.

N2  - A quantitative study of soil macro-arthropod communities and a qualitative study of soil micro-arthropod communities were carried out in the summer of 1977 in the Bonin Islands. The macro-arthropod fauna of the islands is characterized by the great abundancy of the terrestrial crustaceans (83.5%), comprising Isopoda (73.9%) and Amphipoda (9.6%). On the contrary, Chilopoda and Coleoptera are markedly reduced in number, both of them not attaining in number to 1% of total macro-arthropods. Based on the difference in dominant animal groups, the communities of macroarthropods were classified into 9 types, such as the Armadillidiidae type, the Armadillidiidae-Diplopoda type, the Oniscidae type, the Amphipoda-Oniscidae type, the Diplopoda-Formicidae type, etc. No strong relation was found between vegetations and animal abundancy and also between vegetations and the community types mentioned above. Frequencies (1-5) of each micro-arthropod group were studied in each of 10 natural vegetations and 8 substitutional vegetations. The preferences for natural vegetations (P) was calculated on each animal group by the following formula : p=F_n-F_s, where F_n is average frequency in the natural vegetations and F_s is that in the substitutional vegetations. Symphyla, Pauropoda, Embioptera and the 3 other groups showed high value of P (+2.7&acd;+1.4), while Armadillidiidae and Curculionidae were found to be animal groups of the lowest value of P (-1.7&acd;-2.1). The index of naturalness (I_φ) was calculated by the formula I_φ=ΣP_i・F_i, where P_i is a value of P of an animal group i and F_i is frequency (1-5) of an animal group i. As the result of this treatment, the vegetations of the highest I_φ were Pisonia umbellifera forest (Mt. Sekimon) and Schima mertensiana forest (Mt. Chuo and Mt. Kuwanoki), while those of the lowest I_φ were Leucaena glauca forests (Mt. Mikazuki and Miyanohama) and Casuarina litorea forests (Suzaki and Omura).

N2  - In the Bonin Islands, there occur 55 species of aquatic and semiaquatic insects including 23 endemic ones as shown in Table 1. Six of them [Anax guttatus, Hypselosoma sp., Halobates sericeus, Halobates germanus, Microvelia (?) sp., Goera sp.] are newly recorded from the islands in the present paper. The descriptions of some interesting species are also given. Of the 55 species, 11 are of the Indo-Chinese origin, 11 of the Malayan origin and 5 of the Papuan origin, while 15 are either cosmopolitan or widespread species and 13 are of uncertain origin. The endemic species are also discriminated in a similar ratio; 4 Indo-Chinese, 5 Malayan, 4 Papuan and 10 of uncertain origin. Fourteen species of aquatic and semiaquatic insects seem to have invaded the Bonin Islands being carried by air current and 7 by ocean current. Though the fauna of the Bonin Islands is very poor as regards aquatic and semiaquatic insects, it is characterized by the existence of high percentage of endemic species.

N2  - Our knowledge is very insufficient on the staphylinid fauna of the Bonin Islands, lying about 1,000-1,200 km south of Tokyo. Fortunately, the author had two opportunities to make collectings on the islands in the summer of 1972 and the autumn of 1976,and was able to obtain by himself many staphylinid specimens. Besides, the author examined some additional material through the courtesy of Messrs. T. HANATANI, Y. HORI, Y. KUSUI, Y. TANOKUCHI and N. WATANABE. In this paper, 30 species of staphylinid beetles from the Bonins are listed based upon the materials mentioned above; of these, 24 species are newly recorded from the islands and 7 are new to the staphylinid fauna of Japan. It can be said that the staphylinid fauna of the Bonin Islands is characterized by the following points : 1) Mountain species and large ground-living species do not exist in the islands, which are oceanic and considerably distant from any continents. 2) In the Bonin Islands, species belonging to the subfamily Oxytelinae are predominant as compared with the staphylinid faunas of the Islands of Miyaki-jima and Yakushima, the former belonging to the Izu Islands and the latter to the Ryukyus. This phenomenon may have been resulted from the fact that the oxytelines are mostly minute and are readily carried by wind. 3) No endemic species has hitherto been found from the islands. Even though certain endemic forms arc found in future, they will form a very small percentage of the whole staphylinid fauna of the Bonins. 4) A majority of the staphylinid species found in the Bonins are either circumtropical or cosmopolitan.

N2  - In the present paper, the phylogeny and zoogeography of Lucanus gamunus SAWADA et Y. WATANABE, 1960,which was described from the Island of Mikura-jima and is endemic to two small islands of the Izu Islands, Central Japan is delineated. A discussion on the origin of the Izu Islands is also given on the basis of the above accounts. Lucanus gamunus is included in the parryi-group of the genus Lucanus SCOPOLI, 1763. This group consists of the three species, gamunus SAWADA et Y. WATANABE, 1960,parryi BOILEAU, 1899,and laetus ARROW 1943 (=oberthuri PLANET, 1897,nec PLANET, 1896). Of these, gamunus is the most primitive and laetus is the most evolved. The range of individual variation is smallest and rather constant in gamunus and largest in laetus. A similar tendency has been known in the other species-groups of the genus Lucanus SCOPOLI, and also in other lucanid genera. From this, the following two rules may be inferred : in the same group, subgenus, or genus, a species showing smaller individual variation can be regarded as primitive, and on the contrary, a variable species can be considered to be evolved; and in a variable species smaller individuals are closer in appearance to the ancestral form of that species. Based upon the zoogeographic analysis of the parryi-group, the auth or came to the conclusion that gamunus did not originate in the Izu Islands or anywhere else in Japan proper. It must have arisen somewhere in the Continental China, perhaps in the western part, and immigrated into the Izu Islands through Japan proper. In an older glacial age of the Pleistocene, the ancestor of gamunus may have invaded Japan from the Continent, perhaps from Central China, and during the next interglacial age, it was isolated and survived in Japan. The legitimate descendant that had remained in the Continent became evolved into parryi-like psecies. In the last stage, the most evolved species, laetus, arose in the native land of this group, West China, and parryi was expelled from there to the mountains bordering on Fukien and Kiangsi. It can be safely said that in the parryi-group, the most primitive species survives in an area most distant from the centre of dispersal of this group, while the most evolved species occupies the native place. In many groups of the genus Lucanus Scopoli, it is not true that primitive species are found in the centre of dispersal not that the land having many species is the centre of dispersal.

N2  - This paper deals with a part of results of my studies on the Coleoptera fauna of Izu and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands. Marked differences in the Coleoptera fauna between the two island groups are suggested. New distribution records of some species from these islands and descriptions of two new species, Ascetoderes popei and Pentaphyllus izuanus, are given.

N2  - Five families, 29 genera and 43 species of calyptrate muscoid flies were recorded form Ogasawara Islands. Eight endemic species, Pygophora boninensis, Lispe haha, Lispe boninensis Limnophora boninensis, Limnophora haha, Limnophora bracteola, Limnophora setibunda and Limnophora umbra, and 1 each endemic species of Sarcophagidae, Goniophyto boninensis, and Calliphoridae, Lucilia snyderi, were reconfirmed. Almost and species recorded in this paper commonly distribute in Oriental and Palaearctic regions than Australian region. They probably introduced in Ogasawara islands by means of artificial way. Some muscid species, Gymnodia ascendens, Gymnodia nigrogrisea, Stomoxys calcitrans and Haematobosca sanguinolenta, were apparently introduced with cattle or other herbivorous animals, because their larvae are scatophagous, epsecially cow dung.

N2  - Finger and palm prints were obtained from 306 Hachijo Islanders (158 males and 148 females). Digital patterns were classified as whorls, ulnar loops, radial loops, or arches (Tables 1,2). The mean pattern intensity index was calculated for each sex (Table 3). Terminations of main line D were classified, according to CUMMINS & MIDLO (1926), as type 7,type 9,or type 11 (Table 4). The main-line indices (CUMMINS, 1936) were calculated for right and left palms of each sex (Table 5). Courses of line C were classified, according to PLATO (1970), as ulnar, radial, proximal, or absent (Table 6). Combined frequencies of patterns in the hypothenar and thenar areas were recorded (Table 7). The incidences of digital patterns, types of lines D and C, hypothenar patterns, and thenar patterns in Hachijo Islanders are compared with those in the inhabitants of adjacent islands, Hondo (Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu), Ryukyu, the Ainu in Hokkaido, and the Chamorro in Marianas in Tables 8&acd;12. BHATTACHARYYA's measure of angular distance between two multinomial populations was applied to those incidence data and weighted averages of distances in six traits between Hachijo and other population samples were calculated (Table 13). Results show that the closest to Hachijo is Ryukyu, followed by Hondo and O Island, and the remotest are the Ainu and the Chamorro. For calculation of distances between Hachijo and 7 districts in Hondo, only male digital pattern frequencies and line D type frequencies were available. Average distances shown in the last column of Table 14 are much the same for all districts in Hondo and far larger than that between Hachijo and Ryukyu. No district in Hondo was disclosed to be particularly close to or remote from Hachijo. Much more works on other characters and in other disciplines are needed before we can understand the significance of close resemblance between Hachijo and Ryukyu in dermatoglyphic pattern incidences.

N2  - There are found 103 species of hepatics from the Izu Islands, volcanic islands ranging from 30°08′N to 34°40′N and about 139°30′E. The forest vegetation on each island is greatly different according to the difference of volcanic activity and the most well developed hepatic vegetation is found in the Shiia cuspidata-Machilus thunbergii forest developed on the tops of Mt. NISHIYAMA and Mt. HIGASHIYAMA of Hacshijo Island. The 103 species of hepatics can be classified into four floristic elements; i.e., 1) The Southern Japan element which is mainly distributed in the Ryukyu Islands and southern Kyushu extending to southernmost parts of Honshu... 65 spp (ca. 64%), 2) The Honshu element which is mainly distributed in temperate region of Honshu and extended the range to the Izu Islands through Izu Peninsula... 29 spp (ca. 30%), 3) The Bonin element which is extending the range from the Bonin Islands and Micronesia...1 sp. (ca. 1%), and 4) the introduced element which is introduced to the Izu Islands from Honshu by human activity or by migratory birds. Remarkable range extensions were noted for Lejeunea claviflora, Scapania ligulata, Riccardia kodamae, and Lopholejeunea nipponica, all of which were previously known only from southernmost part of Kyushu.

N2  - Fragments of carapaces and chelipeds of the decapod crustaceans found in stomach contents of 30 specimens of Gnathodentex aurolineatus (LACEPEDE) and 5 of Lethrinus variegatus VALENCIENNES were examined. These two fish species of the family Lethrinidae living in rocky shore of shallow water are highly useful for food in the Ogasawara Islands. The results of identification are presented on pages 141-143. The crabs were referred to 18 species, viz., 1 of the Leucosiidae, 4 of the Majidae, 2 of the Parthenopidae, 2 of the Portunidae and 9 of the Xanthidae. Among them Coelocarcinus foliatus EDMONDSON of the Portunidae, which has hitherto been known only from two distant localities in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Hawaii and Madagascar, is of the most importance due to the first finding in Japanese waters. Since it is generally difficult to collect the crabs and to observe the habit of fishes living in rocky shore of shallow water, examination of stomach contents of fishes angled contirubtes to the knowledge of crab fauna in question as well as food habit of these useful fishes.

N2  - According to 'Hand-list of the Japanese Birds' (1942), the Bush Warblers (Cettia diphone) on the Izu-Ogasawara-Iwo chain were divided into 4 forms, i.e., ijimae KURODA (Izu Islands), panafidinicus MOMIYAMAMA (Torishima), diphone KITTLITZ (Ogasawara Islands), and iwootoensis MIOMIYAMA (Iwo Islands). VAURIE (1954) reviewed the forms of this species and synonymized ijimae with the mainland cantans and panafidinicus and iwootoensis with nominate diphone. His toxonomic opinion was adopted by the latest 'Check-list of Japanese Birds' (1974). However, the material available to VAURIE from these islands was very few and doubts have been thrown on the validity of his conclusions. In the present study I have been able to examine more than 150 specimens of adult males. Measurements, all taken by myself, were given in Table 1. An analysis of the measurements (Figs. 1-5) and color variation confirms the VAURIE's general conclusion that only two forms are discernible for the populations of Cettia diphone of the Izu-Ogasawara-Iwo chain. One form (nominate diphone), which consists of the populations of the Ogasawara and Iwo Islands, has the wing and tail shorter and the beak slender and longer than the mainland and Izu Islands populations, and the plumage more rufous on the upper-parts and paler (whitish) on the under-parts. The other form (cantans), which consists of the mainland and Izu Islands populations, has the wing and tail longer and the beak thicker and shorter than nominate diphone, and the plumage more olive on the upperparts and tinged with gray on the flanks, abdomen, and under tail-coverts.VAURIE synonymized panafidinicus with nominate diphone, but these two are different. The pouplation of Torishima (panafidinicus) has all characteristics of cantans mentioned above, except for the beak which is averaging longer than any Izu Islands population. Nevertheless the beak length of the Torishima population overlaps considerably with that of the Hachijo (C.D.=0.86) or Miyake (C.D.=0.46) population. I therefore consider that panafidinicus should be placed among the synonyms of the mainland cantans.

N2  - The Kurusuno Formation distributed widely in the south of the "Nakasuji Graben" was proposed by KATTO and MITUSI (1974). This Formation attains about 8,000 meters in thickness and is composed mainly of fine to medium grained sandstone, black slaty shale and alternation of fine grained sandstone and slaty shale. The general strikes of the Formation change by the faults with NNW-SSE strike from ENE-WSW in the east to NE-SW in the west. The Kurusuno Formation is folded with a wave-length of 1 to 4 kilometers and the upper part of the formation is exposed to the southward. From the lithological and other evidences, the Kurusuno Formation is inferred to have been deposited in the Paleogene.

N2  - In the present paper the hepatic flora of serpentine areas in Shikoku, southern Japan, was discussed. At lower altitudes (usually less than 1000 m. alt.), the serpentine areas are dominated by Pinus densiflora, forming dry , open forest, and there occur only a few species of ubiquitous hepatics. Mt. Higashi-akaishi (1700 m. alt.) and Mt. Shiraga (1400 m. alt.) have very peculiar forest vegetations of Chamaecyparis obtusa-Pinus parviflora on the serpentine rock as edaphis climax, and there are developed very rich vegetation of hepatics dominated by Bazzania spp. and Plagiochila semidecurrens. Several species of hepatics listed as "preferring the serpentine as substrate" by HATTORI (1955,1957) as well as HATTORI and INOUE (1959) were also found both on Mt. Higashi-akaishi and Mt. Shiraga but in small quantity. Acrobolbus ciliatus, Bazzania trilobata, B. pearsonii, and Jungermannia pumila were disjunctively distributed in Shikoku and they were found only at the serpentine areas of Mt. Higashi-akaishi and Mt. Shiraga.

N2  - Cyclogramma flexilis, thus far known only from Continental Asia, has recently been found in Japan. The present paper discusses its nomenclature, external morphology, habitat condition, as well as its relationship with closely allied C. leveillei. A habit sketch and a map showing its range of distribution are attached. The habitat lies on the slope of a small valley at altitude of 200m above sea level, in Kami-Gun, Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku. There the species is growing cohabited with 15 other ferns and 41 flowering plants, most of which are widely spread in Japan. The environment as such suggests its relatively new migration. The Japanese fern in discussion well agrees with the original description given by CHRIST. The identity was further verified by the comparison with Chinese specimens determined by CHING, who had examined the type. Cyclogramma flexilis comes closest to C. leveillei, from which it can easily be segregated by the blackish lanceolate scales and the shape and size of the lowest pinnae. Its range of distribution, spread over the Sino-Japanese region, appears in Japan to be the Sohayaki Type.

N2  - The "Sohayaki element" was defined by the late Dr. Gen-ichi KOIDZUMI in 1931 as one of the important floristic elements of Southwest Japan, and 101 species of vascular plants were enumerated by him as the components of the element (in MAYEBARA, 1931). Since then, several investigations have been attempted to clarify the entity of the present element. It is now regarded as one of the most ancient flora of Japan. No one, however, has reevaluated the species enumerated by KOIDZUMI. Having the specimens deposited in the herbaria of Kyoto University (KYO), University of Tokyo (TI), Tokyo Metropolitan University (Makino Herbarium-MAK) and National Science Museum, Tokyo (TNS), the flowering plants cited by KOIDZUMI as the components of the "Sohayaki element" are studied in this paper from taxonomic and phytogeographic point of view. The phytogeographic significance of the present element is also discussed. As shown in Table 1,the following five groups are recognized in the "Sohayaki element" by the distribution pattern of each species. The distribution maps, based on the specimens kept in the herbaria cited above, are drawn by the KLIPS-C computer system designed by Dr. H. KANAI, National Science Museum, Tokyo. I : The plants are distributed in the Sohayaki region which includes Kii Peninsula, Shikoku and Kyushu (as shown in Fig. 1), though they are divided into 5 subgroups(A-E). The plants belonging to the subgroups of B, C, D, and E are distributed in rather narrow area than those of A. II : The plants are distributed only in the West Japan as shown in Fig. 2. III : The plants are distributed in both West and East Japan, though they are divided into 5 subgroups (A-E). Distribution areas of B and C are shown in Fig. 3 and 4,respectively. IV : The plants are distributed from the Sohayaki region in West Japan to rather north area in central Honshu as shown in Fig. 5. V : The plants are distributed from Japan to Northeast China throughout Korean Peninsula. VI : The plants are widely distributed in both Japan and the Chinese Continent. KOIDZUMI also described the following elements with the enumeration of the species, i.e. , "Central Chinese element : 51 spp.", "Kuma-Kanto element : 22 spp.", "Manchuria-Korean element : 38 spp." and "Chugoku element : 27 spp.". The "Kuma-Kanto element" was considered as the plants endemic to the areas from Kyushu to Kanto district of Honshu, and the "Chugoku element" as those endemic to the Chugoku district of Honshu. Judging from his definition of each element and the distribution patterns summarized in Table 1,B and C of III are considered as the "Kuma-Kanto element", V is recognized as the "Manchuria-Korean element" and VI as the "Central Chinese element". I and II in Table 1 are the Sohayaki elements which are now generally recognized. The Sohayaki elements occur in the area of warm temperate zone from about 200m to 800m in altitude and are minor constituents in the present vegetation. The habitat of the elements is usually restricted within the limestone or serpentine areas, in rocky places near the river which often overflows and in the ill-nourished or dried places of mountain ridges. These facts suggest that the present elements, protected from extinction by the habitat mentioned above, have survived for long time in competition with the invaders of both glacial and interglacial period.

N2  - During two weeks of June, 1975,the decapod crustaceans were extensively collected at the intertidal zone of 8 localities of Tanega-shima Island in the south of Kyushu, and at 22 stations from the depths of about 35 to 95m off the east and west coasts of the siland. Several additional species were obtained by gill-nets for the shallow-water fishes and squids at the fishing ports of Nishino-omote and Shimama, and a pontoniid shrimp was otherwise commonly found in the mantle cavity of a black lip pearl shell, Pinctada margaritifera cultivated in the small bay at Urata. In addition, fortunately, a collection of crabs from off Mage-jima Island was placed at the author's hand for comparative study. All the materials dealt with here were referred to 186 species and 3 subspecies of 124 genera. The numbers of the species and genera collected at the intertidal zone, by the gill-nets and dredging were shown in Table 1. Only some species are common to the littoral and sublittoral collections, and also to the offshore crabs from Tanega-shima and Magejima Islands. It is notable, but not surprising, that none of the littoral and sublittoral species was not comprised in the samples obtained by dredging. Littoral species were collected at the coral reef, the rocky shore, and the muddy flat of the mangrove swamp. The Macrura and Anomura are represented by the rather common species, while in the Brachyura are some rare species such as Atergatis dilatatus (DE HAAN), Pilumnus purpureus A. MILNE EDWARDS, P. habei TAKEDA et MIYAKE, parapilumnus hondai TAKEDA et MIYAKE and Pilumnopeus marginatus (STIMPSON) of the Xanthidae. Inshore species dredged up from the rocky or shelly sand bottom were mostly represented by the rarer species probably with several new ones. There is no definite report on the Japanese decapod crustaceans as a whole except for YOKOYA (1933), but it is well understood that the considerable numbers of the southern-distributed species extend their geographical ranges northwards to the vicinity of Kii Peninsula or Sagami Bay along with the Kuroshio Warm Current. While many species at hand are without doubt fell into this distribution pattern, due to the absence of many xanthid crabs commonly found in the coral reefs of the Ryukyu Islands it is definitely said that the sea in question forms a boundary at considerable content for the southern species. On the other hand, such species as Pachycheles sculptus STIMPSON of the Porcellanidae and Pagurus geminus MCLAUCHLIN of the Paguridae are really northern in their origin. Cancer amphioetus RATHBUN of the Cancridae obtained from off Mage-jima Island is also different from the other inshore species in its distribution pattern, being known from North China, Korea, the Japan Sea, the Pacific coasts of Japan and North America. In conclusion, the present study revealed that the decapod crustacean fauna of the sea in question is mainly composed of the southern tropical and subtropical species transported by the Kuroshio Current, and otherwise of many temperate species restricted to the southwest Japan or the limited West Pacific along the continent and of a few northern species.

N2  - Yakushima is an island situated about 60km south of the sourthernmost point of Kyushu. So far as known, 24 species of birds are residents on the island and 9 more species breed there as summer visitors. The subspecific status of some Yakushima birds is reexamined based partly on new material collected by the author in 1975. Five endemic subspecies, Picus awokera takatsukasae, Troglodytes troglodytes ogawae, Parus varius yakushimensis, Zosterops japonica insularis, and Garrulus glandarius orii, may be recognizable, although the subspecific differences are comparatively slight. It is doubtful at Parus varius sunsunpi is sufficiently distinct from nominate varius on the mainland. The subspecies of Dendrocopos kizuki on Yakushima is nominate kizuki rather than matsudairai as previously claimed by the Japanese Checklist Committee. Garrulus glandarius hiugaensis and Picus awokera horii are considered to be a synonym of G.g. japonicus and of P.a. awokera respectively. The avifauna of Yakushima is relatively poor and the endemism is very low. There is no endemic species. Thirty-three species of residents and summer visitors can be classified as follows : Resident Summer visitor 1) Same subspecies with Kyushu 10 4 2) Same subspecies with Amami Oshima 1 3 3) Endemic or semiendemic 6 1 4) No subspecific differentiation 5 1 5) Subspecific status unknown 2 0 The mainland element is predominant in the Yakushima avifauna with 14 residents (including 4 endemic and semiedemic subspecies) and 5 summer visitors (including 1 semiendemic subspecies). One species of the residents and 3 summer visitors are of the Ryukyu origin, but none of them has been differentiated subspecifically from the Amami Oshima birds. There is little doubt that the Yakushima avifauna has evolved in close relation with the mainland avifauna of Japan. The colonization of the Ryukyu species seems to be very restricted and relatively recent.

N2  - A series of specimens of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, collected for the first time from Yaku-shima Island, were examined by the author. In this series, the forearm and condylobasal lengths are slightly smaller than those in the lesser type from Kyshu and the Tsushima Islands and decisively so than those in the larger type which is distributed from Shikoku to central part of Kyushu along the median tectonic line of southwestern Japan. On the other hand, the zygomatic breadth is fairly large as compared with both the types. The temporal ridge and lambdoid crest are remarkable. Differences in forearm and condylobasal lengths between the Yaku-shima series and twenty demes of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon from Shikoku and Kyushu were analyzed by the weighted variable-group method. As a result, it became evident that non-overlap percent in each pair of demes is not taxonomicaly significant in forearm length. In condylobasal lengty, the value of non-overlap percent between the Yaku-shima and some Kyushu, Shikoku demes are taxonomically significant. Even in this character, however, the Yaku-shima deme is not different from the demes in Japan proper, so that the former is recognized as Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon TEMMINCK, 1835.

As a result of the study, it became clear that many of characters of the skull and antlers are identical with those of Cervus nippon TEMMINCK from Japan proper. But, the deer possesses peculiar jugals strongly constricted at antero-lower corner of the orbit as in C. pulchellus IMAIZUMI from the Tsushima Islands.

N2  - Kurosegawa Cave is located on a limestone cliff overlooking the Kurosegawa river at Oriai, Shirokawa-cho, Higashi-Uwa-gun, Ehime Prefecture, Shikoku. The cave was selected for excavation from palaeoanthropological and palaeoecological points of view, since it had yielded a few artifactual materials on the occasion of previous speleological survey and two early Jomon Period cave sites yielding well-preserved human skeletal remains had been found in its vicinity. The excavation was carried out in the summer of 1975 with the co-operation of local archaeologists and students. Four square meters were excavated and about 2.6 cubic meters of cave deposits were inspected. Although a few pieces of chert and a number of small fragments of non-human animal bones were recovered, unambiguous evidence of human habitation was not detected in the 1975 excavation. The ground plan and cross-sections of the cave and the trenches (Fig. 1), methods of excavation (Fig. 2,3), description of the deposits, results of the soil analysis (Fig. 4), description and discussion of the chert pieces (Fig. 5), and the list of the faunal remains have been recorded in this report.

N2  - Although many kinds of nautiloids have been discovered in the Mesozoic rocks of all parts of the world, only several species of nautiloids were reported from Japan. The present paper deals with the result of the study of a Triassic nautiloid recently collected from the Zohoin Group of Sakawa, Shikoku. The Zohoin Group is subdivided into five formations, i.e. green tuffaceous mudstone, black muddy sandstone, black mudstone, greenish grey fine-grained sandstone, black sandy mudstone, in ascending order. The nautiloid fossil, associated with many individuals of Daonella spp., was found in the upper sandy part of the black mudstone formation. The locality of the specimen obtained is shown in the index map of Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the geological route map and the geological section of the area. The stratigraphic position of the fossil nautiloid is given in the geological columnar section of Figure 3. The Zohoin Group is assigned to the upper Ladinian, because it yields Protrachyceras aff. archelaus and P. cf. pseudoarchelaus, the upper Ladinian indices. The specimen is photographed in Figure 4. The restored figure is demonstrated in Figure 5. From the septated shell preserved, the following morphologic characters are concluded. The individual seems to have grown up to about 60 mm. or more in diameter. The shell has a fairly wide umbilicus, D=60 and U=30 in mm., showing very evolute involution. The umbilicus is rather deep, surrounded by a high wall which is slightly convex and subrounded to subangular at rim. The whorl is subrectangular in section, rather compressed in the proportion of breadth to height, i.e. H=18.7 and B=17.0 in mm. The maximum breadth is at about middle of the flank. Flanks are nearly parallel, gently inflated, and rather abruptly pass into the flattened venter. The ventrolateral edge is rather sharp, forming the subangular to subrounded shoulder. There are numerous spiral lirae on the surface of the shell. The numbers of lirae are counted about forty-five at the height of 18.7mm. The suture is simple, gently concave on the flank, and is slightly prorsiradiate in the ventro-lateral area. It shows a rather convex curvature on the umbilical wall, but on the ventral side it shows a fairly wide and shallow lobe. Thus, in the shell form and the sutural pattern, the present specimen bears some resemblance to the species belonging to the genus Grypoceras. Grypoceras seems to be a cosmopolitan, having been reported from Europe, Himalayas, California, Nevada and Idaho. The fact that this specimen was found in the Zohoin Group is interesting. The occurrence of Grypoceras might be expected in other areas of Japan.

N2  - The Shimantogawa Group of the Outer Zone of Southwest Japan is generally poor in mega-fossils. Ammonites are especially rare, but they are valuable for age-determination of the strata and for interpretation of sedimentary conditions. Therefore, endeavors have been made in the search for ammonoids. As a result, the following five species of Lower Cretaceous ammonites were reported from the Shimantogawa Group; Aptian Cheloniceras aff. minimum CASEY, Aptian C. shimizui NAKAI and HADA (1966), Middle Albian Dipoloceras aff. fredericksburgense SCOTT, Upper Albian(?) Stoliczkaia japonica MATSUMOTO (1952), and Upper Albian (?) Diplasioceras tosaense MATSUMOTO and HIRATA (1969). In about 1935,Mr. Kiyoshi CHIKAZAWA discovered an interesting specimen of ammonite from the debris of a small hill at Yokohama, Kochi City, Ehime Prefecture. Recently the specimen was presented by Mrs. Ichie CHIKAZAWA to one of the present authors for study. This paper is the result of the study which would offer additional information. The lithology of the specimen is balck muddy coarse sandstone, showing abundant quartz grains and partly including angular fragments of shale. Judging from the locality and the lithology of the specimen, the bed that contained the ammonite specimen must belong to the Lower Cretaceous Hanyama Formation, the formation which has lately yielded Orbitolina lenticularis from its eastern extension(Fig. 1.). The ammonite specimen is shown in Figure 2. The flank of the whorl is slightly inflated. The umbilical margin is craterlike. Numerous fine single costae are observed on the flank and umbilical wall. The ribs on the earlier half are nearly rectiradiate and fairly close to each other, whereas those on the later half are extremely rursiradiate, relatively coarse and far apart from one another. Thus the directions of ribs are clearly different between the earlier and later parts on the flank. The difference may be ascribed to a pathological effect of repair of the shell. As the suture is not observed, the preserved part of the whorl is probably a body chamber. The specimen is assigned to Lytoceratina gen. et. sp. indet.

N2  - The first part of this paper deals with Paleozoic land floras in Japan and a major trend in floristic change during the Paleozoic era. The second part records the introduction and distribution of Japanese Mesozoic land floras together with the brief notes on characteristic of each flora, based on the recent paleobotanical knowledges. The third part concerns the paleofloristic provinces of Japan, from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age as proposed previously by the senior author : 1) the Outer Zone Paleofloristic Province that is included in VAKHRAMEEV's Indo-European Paleofloristic Area, and 2) the Inner Zone Paleofloristic Province that closely resembles his Siberian Paleofloristic Area. The Early Neocomian Ryoseki, Late Neocomian Lower Monobegawa and Aptian-Albian Upper Monobegawa Floras in Kochi Prefecture are respectively synchronous with the Oguchi, Akaiwa and Tamodani Floras in the Inner Zone Paleofloristic Province of Japan, but differ in taxonomic detail and more closely resemble the Wealden Flora of Europe. The contemporaneous flora of the Tetori sequence more closely resembles Early Cretaceous floras of northeastem Eurasia, showing the heterogeneous character of the vegetation of the Japanese Islands during the early part of Cretaceous time. The fourth part of this paper concerns the stratigraphical distribution of Early Cretaceous plants in Kochi Prefecture and also in the Tetori Basin of Inner Zone of Japan. The paleobotanical problems of each flora are discussed in the last part.

N2  - A longitudinal ligament found in the dorsal aortae of the trout, the sardine and also the sturgeon has been noticed from the beginning of this century. This structure is notable, particularly from the systematic point of view, however, little has contributed to the comparative anatomy of this structure. After prosecuting the comparative study of this ligament and the vertebral column supporting the one, the author has come to recognize upique developments of these structures in species of the families; Clupeidae and Salmonidae. This seems to reflect a phylogenetical relationship of these families, and it is necessary to prosecute the further study of various forms. The author has recently studied the several kinds of deep-sea species of the lower teleosts collected off Kochi. This paper deals with the gross morphology of ligament and the correlated osteological peculiarities of these fishes. The study is now in progress, and the author wishes to give here only the following preliminary ideas; 1) In the fishes with longitudinal ligaments inside the aortae, their ligaments developed almost unexceptionally in parallel with the enlargement of the dorsal aorta of elliptic cross section. 2) In Diaphus and Hoplostethus, no ligament developed inside the dorsal aorta, and the aorta itself has comparatively small circular cross section as found commonly in fishes. 3) In Neoscopelus, a feebly developed ligament occurs inside the dorsal aorta. 4) In all fishes with the ligament inside the dorsal aorta, the enlarged aorta is held dorsally by the ventral plateau of the vertebral column. Each of these fishes, however, has its own ventral plateau respectively, and their plateau is not directly derived from the typical ones found in clupeid-salmonid vertebrae.

N2  - A fossil shark's tooty, Carcharodon megalodon, discovered in 1967 is inferred here as has been yielded from the Shimajiri Group (upper Miocene or Pliocene) of Miyakojima, Ryukyu Islands. Judging from the size of this tooth, the shark might have been 5m or more in length.

N2  - Considering the taxonomic characters of Viburnum suspensum and V. taitoensis, V. suspensum is clearly distinguished from the latter, though V. taitoensis was treated by HATUSIMA as the synonym of V. suspensum. Lonicera miyaguskiana and Viburnum tashiroi are considered as distinct species from their allies, though they are treated as varieties in the "Flora of the Ryukyus". Thus, there occur three species endemic to the Ryukyu Islands; Viburnum suspensum, Lonicera miyaguskiana, and Viburnum tashiroi. Viburnum suspensum occurs in Amami-shoto and Okinawa-shoto, and V. tashiroi is distributed in Amami-shoto. Both of these two species do not seem to be distributed in Sakishima-shoto, even though some species related to them occur in Formosa. Two species mentioned here have similar pattern of distribution discontinuous in Sakishima-shoto. SAKAGUCHI (1924) reported Lonicera hypoglauca from Okinawa-jima and Ishigaki-shima. Recently, however, HATUSIMA (1971) noted that the occurrence of L.hypoglauca in this area was doubtful. Although I reexamined all the specimens from the Ryukyu Islands preserved in the Herbaria mentioned above, I did not find any specimen of L.hypoglauca collected in this area. During my short trip to the Islands, I observed and collected a climbing shrub of Lonicera on Mt. Yonaha-dake in Okinawa-jima. Mr.NAKEJIMA pointed out that this shrub might be regarded as L.hypoglauca. In the specimen (Koyama, Fukuoka......Kato 460 in TNS), however, the lower surface of leaf is covered with hirsute hairs but without gland. Considering these features of this shrub, the shrub should be determined as L.affinis. Specimens recorded under L.hypoglauca in the Ryukyu Islands, therefore, may be considered to be L.affinis.

N2  - Yonaguni-jima, the southernmost island of the Ryukyu lslands, is situated between Iriomote-jima and Formosa. Compared with those of neighbouring islands, lriomote-jima and lshigaki-shima, the flora of Yonaguni-jima is rather poor in endemism. Only two species, Elatostema yonakuniense and Aster Walkeri are known to be endemic to this island. This paper deals with plants of taxonomic or phytogeographical interest based on collections recently made by the present authors and materials collected by various investigators. Two new forms of Limonium Wrightii are described. Three plants belonging to Asplenium, Ligustrum and Tylophora are mentioned to be noteworthy. The occurrences of Angiopteris palmifolia and Selaginella leptophylla are confirmed. Rubus fraxinifolia, Gymnema alternifolia and Angiopteris lygodiifolia are considered to be elimnated from the flora of this island. Extinction of Potamogeton pectinatus due to destruction of the habitat is reported. Some plants found on Yonaguni-jima are also present in Kashoto (Green Island), Kotosho (Bote1 Tobago or Orchid Island) and Batan Island, but are absent from the mainland of Formosa. This unique pattern of distribution is briefly discussed in this paper from a phytogeographical view point. Among plants showing this type of distribution, two plant groups are recognized. The first group contains warm temperate elements commonly distributed in the Ryukyu Islands and the mainland of Japan. The other group includes locally differenciated plants belonging to genera widespread in tropical region. Most plants belonging to the firt group show the disperasl by bird, while those belonging to the scond group by wind. Sea current can not be regarded to play any role in the dispersal of these plants. The fact mentioned here seems to indicate the presence of an established route of plant migration through these islands.

N2  - At least 42 species of land birds have been known to breed in the Ryukyu Islands excluding the Daito group. Of these, six are endemic species. The remaining 36 species can be classified into 11 non-endemic subspecies (Table 1) and 25 endemic ones (Tables 2 and 3). Their distribution and subspecific differentiation are analyzed. Except for two very significant endemic species (i.e., Sapheopipo noguchii and Garrulus lidthi), the present land bird fauna of the Ryukyus consists mainly of Palearctic species (80 %) The rest (20%) is southern elements that have invaded the islands via Taiwan irrespective of their origins. Both the Palearctic species and southern elements are considered to be relatively recent in origin, possibly colonyzing the Ryukyu Islands after the present conformation of the islands was established. The old Ryukyus may have had a distinct avifauna (SHORT, 1973b), but it appears that the old Ryukyu avifanua has been replaced by recent invaders from Japan and Taiwan on a large scale. The geologic history of the islands probably played an important part in the extinction of the old avifauna, although it seems to have had little significance on the establishment of the present one.

N2  - The stratigraphic succession of rocks constituting Iriomote-jima is established as follows : Tumuru Formation, Miyara Formation, Yubu Volcanics, Yaeyama Group, Sonai Conglomerate, Ryukyu Limestone, and terrace gravel depostits, in ascending order. The Tumuru Formation constitutes the basement of Iriomote-jima and is composed mainly of glaucophane schist accompanied by black schist and crystalline limestone lense. The Formation is developed in the northeast corner of the island, and is unconformably overlain by the Miyara Formation. The Miyara Formation, newly found by the present authors, consists of hard compact limestone containing late Eocene larger foraminifers. Its distribution is limited only to the upper reaches of Yonara-gawa, northwest of Mihara. The Yubu Volcanics, newly proposed by the authors, unconformably covers the pervious two, and consists of pyroclastics of andesitic composition with a minor amount of rhyolite lava flow. The Yaeyama Group begins with conglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, and is succeeded upward by bedded sandstone with thin-bedded siltstone, cross-bedded thick sandstone, alternation of sandstone and carbonaceous siltstone containing plants fossils in the upper part, cross-bedded sandstone, and alternation of sandstone and sandy siltstone. This group makes the bulk of Iriomote-jima. The relation between the group and the underlying formations is considered to be unconformable. The Sonai Conglomerate, which is limited only to the vicinity of Sonai, is composed of cobbles to boulders of sandstone and limestone; the limestone contains many Miocene larger foraminifers. The Sonai Conglomerate lies unconformably on the Yaeyama Group. The Ryukyu Limestone is a reef limestone crop-ping out around the margin of the island. It is most extensive in southeastern Iriomote-jima, and covers the underlying formations with unconformity. The terrace gravel deposits developed on the east side of the island consists of reddish soil and rounded gravels derived from the preceding formations. Its relation to the underlying formations is unconfromable, but the relation with the Sonai Conglomerate is unknown because the conglomerate is not developed on the east side of the island. In geneaal the stratigraphic sequence is well correlated with that of Ishigaki-shima.

N2  - A fossil elephant tooth was discovered from the sea shore about 1.5km southwest of Kyan village, Itoman-shi, Okinawa, by Mr. Kiichi Maja of Ginowan-shi. The specimen was brought to T. NOHARA in October 1972 for study. The specimen is the upper second tooth of six molars. As indicated in figure 3,the specimen is incomplete and very small with the surface worn out. The number of ridges in the present specimen, however, is nearly the same as in Palaeoloxodon naumanni (MAKIYAMA) from the Seto Inland Sea (HASEGAWA, 1972), the lameller frequency being 9 in 50×2mm. And the shape, enamel ridges and other characters are very similar to P. naumanni hitherto found in Japan. The stratigraphic horizon of the occurrence of this fossil is probably Naha limestone, a member of the Ryukyu limestone. This fact is very important and interesting for considering the Paleogeographic situation of the Ryukyu Islands and the Asiatic Continent.

N2  - Although the wild boar of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan, has long been recognized as a local race of Sus scrofa LINNAEUS, 1758,by most of the recent authors, it may be a relict nearly related to the common ancestor of the boars. According to the author's opinion, Sus scrofa itself is a superspecies containing such distinct species as cristatus, scorofa, meridionalis, vittatus, leucomystax and riukiuanus. Each of the last three forms of East Asia undoubtedly belonging to a clade, the vittatus group, is in different stage of phylogenetic sequence and seems to have independent history of expansion of the population in the past. It is most likely that such populations have been reproductively isolated from each other more or less completely and that severe competition for existence may have taken place when they meet in a given area. The present distribution of those species must be a final result of such competitions reflecting the presence of reproductive isolation between them. This is the reason why the author is inclined to erect them as distinct species. The wild boar of the Ryukyu Islands, Sus riukiuanus KURODA, 1924,will be recognized on the following cranial and dental characters : upper length of skull as large as that in a cline of leucomystax TEMMINCK, 1942,from Honshu and Kyushu, Japan, Yc=153.8+4.9Xmm, Sys=15.9mm (X=temperature index), and much smaller than that of vittatus BOIE, 1828,Yc=302.0+2.4Xmm, Sys=19.4mm, which contains populations from Ussuri, Manchuria, Korea, Szechwan, Fukien, Formosa, Johore, Sumatra, Java, etc. Second and third upper molars smaller and simpler, and auditory bulla smaller than those of leucomystax. Naso-premaxillary suture incomplete except in old stage, and condyle and angular portion of mandible less developed. Those characters are most clearly retained in the population of Iriomote Island. The cranial and dental characters of the native domestic pig of Hainan, China, are distinctly in primitive conditions than those of vittatus and leucomystax, but evidently in progressed stage of phylogenetic development than in riukiuanus. The opinion of some authors that riukiuanus may only be a feral domestic pig seems not to be acceptable.

N2  - 1. From seismic profiler records, three reflectors were read in sediments on the island shelf and slope. Layer A, above reflector A, is generally trapped on the indented topographies. Layer B, from reflector A to reflector B, is generally unconformable to Layer C which has itself many reflectors under reflector C. Reflectors B and C undulate fairly parallel. One of the reflectors within Layer C, is assumed to be a boundary between sediments and crystalline rocks (basement) from seismic refractoin data in the adjacent area. On the slope brake, Layer C outcrops and thickness of the sediments above crystalline basement decrease. In the basin area, there is no distinct reflectors in sediments above acoustic basement. As the surface of the basement is generally smooth, it is probably said that thin opaque sediments are covering the oceanic layer 2. On the Shatsky Rise, the boundary between transparent sedimentary layer and the underlying opaque one corresponds to the boundary between Paleogene and upper Cretaceous, chronologically, according to JOIDES. Therefore, it is assumed that age of oceanic crust south of Hokkaido is probably uppermost Cretaceous. 2. In the sea around Hokkaido, topographic, geologic and geomagnetic trends are traced as shown in Figs. 17 and 20. Extension of those trends are traced on land and assumed to be geological trends of pre-Miocene. From those data, geological patterns of Hokkaido are presumably extending to the SSE-direction and approach to the axis of trench. In the Okhotsk Sea, trend α is assumed to be a belt connecting Mesozoic unit of the Naka-Shiretoko Peninsula in Sakhalin and one of the Tokoro belt in Hokkaido. Trend δindicates a southwest boundary of the Okhotsk Basin. 3. From the magnetic and gravity anomaly patterns (Figs. 21 and 22,respectively) a geological boundary is presumed in the area south off Kushiro. Assuming that the boundary coincides with the Kushiro Canyon, the southernmost part of X-Y line in Fig. 22 was drawn. The authors take a hypothesis that the Japanese Islands split from the Asiatic Continent and also the Kurile arc did from the Okhotsk continental shelf. At the time of the splitting, a straight line X-Y in Fig. 2 might be a shear fault which was assumed to have bent as shown in Fig. 20 by the succeeding tectonics of the Kurile Arc. The central part of the curved line X-Y was drawn tentatively in oder to complete the line. The authors wish to call this line "Kushiro Canyon Tectonic Line". 4. As shown in Fig. 21,clear magntic anomaly patterns exist, which trends to run ENE-WSW and are detectable on both the sides of the trench wall. There is no distince differences in amplitude of the magnetic anomaly patterns on both the walls, but on the landside wall the amplitude decreases and becomes undetectable at the distance of 50-60km from the trench axis. If the decrease of amplitude is assumed to be brought by sinking of oceanic plate under the island crust, dip angle of the plate is calculated to be about 10 degrees within the range of 50-60km from the axis. It is important, geophysically, that the oceanic plate is not strongly disturbed near the axis. Along the Kurile Trench, magnetic patterns indicate short waves superposed on the original long waves. Those short waves may have some relations with faults which are frequently found parallel to the trench axis. 5. From patterns of geological trends and presumable tectonic line "Kushiro Canyon Tectonic Line", it may be assumed that a fairly broad area of island crust had existed outside the present trench axis and was brought under the island arc by the process of island arc tectonics. There is such a possibility that the Japanese Islands had a straight form and a geological belt corresponding to the Hidakas had existed on the outermost boundary of the Outer Belt of Japan before the Japanese Islands split from the Asiatic Continent.

N2  - A survey was made on trematodes of the sea fishes at Samani, southern Hidaka District, Hokkaido, during the period August 3 to 19,1970,and September 8 to 11,1971. We examined 213 fishes of 42 species, from which 4 species of 3 families of monogenetic trematodes and 35 species of 8 families of digenetic trematodes were collected (Tables 1 & 2). ZHUKOV (1960) examined the fish parasites in the sea around Putjatin Island in Peter the Great Bay and Shikotan Island of the southern Kuriles. Compared with his survey, many trematodes belonging to the cold current were common among the Hikaka area and above-mentioned two areas. A few trematodes belonging to the warm current, such as Maculifer japonicus, Opechona orientalis and Bianium hemistoma, were detected from the Putjatin area. On the other hand, such trematodes were scarecely seen from the Hidaka and Shikotan areas. Therefore, the Hidaka and Shikotan areas resemble closely each other in this regard. This fact indicates that the coast of the southern Hidaka District is greatly influenced by the cold current.

N2  - The survey on the biomass of the benthonic polychaetes off Samani, Hokkaido, was made in August, 1970. Eleven stations were selected in this area (see Fig.1). The bottom samples were obtained by dredging. The dredge was towed for about ten minutes at speeds of about two knots at each station. The polychaetes were examined and classified into 82 species adding indeterminable ones. The biomass of polychaetes at the area including Sts. 11,14,4 and 12 is dominant than the other stations, Therefore this area seems to be a good fishing-ground for benthic fishes.

N2  - The spider fauna of Mt. Daisetsu was investigated in 1970 as a project of JIBP-CT-S section, and fairly many spiders were brought to light. However, nothing has hitherto been known on the spider fauna of the Hidaka mountain range. Fortunately, the author had an opportunity to examine the spiders collected by Dr. J. AOKI, Dr. S.-I. UENO and other zoologists during the surveys of Mt. Poroshiri-dake and Mt. Petegari-dake. Materials handed over to the author for identification include about 200 individuals, which were classified into 37 species of 25 genera belonging to 13 families. Of these, six species were recognized as being new to science; three others were newly added to the fauna of Hokkaido, i.e. Theridion chikunii YAGINUMA, Prolinyphia marginella OI and Xysticus atrimaculatus BOESENBERG et STRAND. Some species of Micryphantidae and Salticidae are still awaiting further investigation, because many of them are either immature of represented by a single sex. Pellenes ususudi has long been called under the name of Plexippus incognitus, whose real nature is uncertain. The author has carefully re-examined this spider and described it as a new species at this opportunity. Though the spiders taken in this survey are not numerous, most of them are common to Mt. Daisetsu. One-fourth of these species are either Palaearctic of Holarctic, and the remainings are Japanese basic species distributed in the northern parts of Japan.

N2  - According to the investigation executed by the party from the National Science Museum, Tokyo, in the summers of 1970 and 1971,the small mammal fauna of the Hidaka Mountains, Hokkaido, is fairly different from most of the plains but rather similar to that of Rishiri Island, a small island off the northern extremity of the main island, in the combination of important species. They resemble each other not only in the presence of a vole of the Clethrionomys rex group and a tiny shrew nearly related to Sorex gracillimus THOMAS, 1907,but also in the absence of Sorex shinto saevus THOMAS, 1907,one of the two common shrews in the plains of the main island of Hokkaido. Voles of the rex group, containing Clethrionomys rex IMAIZUMI, 1971,of Rishiri Island and C. montanus sp. nov. of the Hidaka Mountains, are evidently more primitive in several external, cranial and dental characters than those of the rufocanus group, which contains C. bedfordiae (THOMAS, 1905) of the main island of Hokkaido and C. sikotanensis (TOKUDA, 1935) of Rishiri I. and Shikotan I. of the Habomai Islands. Moreover, within the respective groups, the forms of small islands are less advanced than those of the main island as shown in Fig. 1. These nearly related forms belonging to the same clade with compete each other when they are in a sympatric condition of distribution, because they are probably poorly differentiated in the ecological niche. In such cases more advanced forms tend to destroy the primitive ones, as clearly seen in three lineages of Japanese moles, Mogera minor, M. wogura and M. kobeae (IMAIZUMI, 1964). A lineage, here used by the author, is a taxon applied not only to good species but also ill-defined hemispecies or even some of subspecies based on the biological species concept, and differs from other lineages by the relative time of emergence or of animated expansion of the distribution. Such competition may be more violent in a combination of nearest two lineages than that of rather remote ones, as the former is less different in physical characters and also in ecological niches than the latter. Evident correlations between the degree of specialization and the relative time of emergence of taxa have been confirmed among the lineages of the glareolus group, of the Japanese moles, etc. If this is acceptable as a general rule, the earliest of the four lineages of the voles that arrived in the Hokkaido district might be Clethrionomys rex, now confined to Rishiri Island (Fig.1). At first probably C. rex and then C. sikotanensis expanded their distribution nearly all over the district. Later, both of the populations were exterminated from the main island of Hokkaido through violent competitions with newly arrived and more advanced lineages, C. montanus of the former group and C. bedfordiae of the latter one. On the other hand, not so violent but rather loose competitions have been carried on between these conquerors, and montanus was gradually exterminated from the plains and finally almost confined to the alpine and subalpine zones of the Hidaka Mountains. Very similar process of emergences and competitions might be carried out between Sorex shinto saevus and a tiny shrew similar to Sorex gracillimus. The former, which has now nearly exterminated tha latter from the plains of the main island, probably failed to invade into Rishiri Island because of its later arrival. Thus, the similarities between the small mammal faunas of Rishiri Island and the high mountain zone of Hidaka Mountains can easily be understood as a result of successive appearances and expansions of slightly advanced lineages in the same clade and violent competitions between them which can be hindered by some topographical factors.

N2  - To obtain a knowledge of the marine flora and the communities along the coast of Hidaka, Hokkaido, intertidal collections of marine plants were made at 8 points in this region in July, 1970 and May, 1971. As a result of the present survey, it is encountered that there are 134 species of marine algae and 2 species of marine grasses. Of these algae, 85 are species belonging to the Rhodophyceae, 33 to the Phaeophyceae, and the rest to the Chlorophyceae. From the viewpoint of the geographical distribution, this area has a marine flora represented by subarctic elements, in co-existence with a few number of temperate species, such as Gelidium amansii, Grateloupia filicina, G. turuturu, Caulacanthus okamurai, Gymnogongrus flabelliformis, Campylaephora crassa, Acrosorium yendoi, Undaria pinnatifida, Bryopsis plumosa and Codium fragile. The vertical distribution of marine plants in the intertidal region in this coast occurs in zones as follows, in descending order : Gloiopeltis furcata, Porphyra spp.-Pelvetia wrightii, Fucus evanescens-Analipus japonicus-Chondrus yendoi-Phyllospadix iwatensis-Laminaria angustata.

Their vertical distribution is shown in Table 2. The features of the following two species were described : 1. Dictyostelium sp. The strains referred to this species seem to be included within the Dictyostelium mucoroides complex. They resemble Dictyostelium delicatum, but differ from the latter in several characters which are shown in the following table. [table] 2. Sappinia sp. The stalked encysted individuals of the present strains are club-like in side vew and apparently have three or four projections when examined from the upper side. The strains may be identical with one (Sappinia sp.-1 in Fig. 2) of the three species which were found in the soil samples obtained at Mt. Daisen, Tottori Pref., in October of 1971.

N2  - The wood structure of Acer mono var. glabrum is similar to those of other varieties of A. mono. However, the number of stand parenchyma is, in general, rather scanty, and it is especially notable that these parenchyma are seldom transformed into chambered parenchyma. We have found only one example of chambered parenchyma including small crystals. Although shape, size and number of crystalliferous parenchyma vary considerably in the same taxon or even with individuals, the rarenes of chambered parenchyma seems to be characteristic of A. mono var. glabrum. When we take this character into consideration, A. mono var. glabrum may be easily distinguished from A. mono var. Savatieri and A. mono var. marmoratum f. heterophyllus. In addition, the ray is sometimes 6-seriate in A. mono var. glabrum, while it is usually less than 5-seriate in the other two taxa.

N2  - A Tertiary bed was newly found at about 23 km upstream the mouth of the Motourakawa river, although its distribution is narrowly limited (Fig. 1). The bed in question is referred to the lower to middle Miocene or upper Oligocene, for the reason that it contains some index fossils of mollusca. The palynological investigation also supports this age determination. In this bed a costa of Cetacea gen. et sp. indet. (Fig. 2) was found in association with marine invertebrates which suggest a shallow muddy sedimentary environment. The present paper briefly describes the observed characteristics of the bone and discusses its geologic age. Another specimen of mammalian bone (Fig. 3) is preserved at the National Science Museum, Tokyo. Its locality was reported as Urakawa-machi, Hokkaido, but no other information is available. The specimen was identified as an atlas of Bison sp. This was the first discovery of bison in Hokkaido and of its atlas Bone in Japan.

N2  - In Hokkaido, the northernmost main island of Japan, the two old mountain ranges called the Hidakas and the Yubaris maintain the trechine faunas that are very similar to each other. They bear a closer faunal relationship to northeastern Honshu than to any other part of Hokkaido, since both of them harbour anophthalmic species of the genus Trechiama but are lacking in Trechus (s. lat.). On the other hand, they share the isolated endemic genus Masuzoa, which seems to be a relict of an old fauna. A rough outline of the trechine fauna of Hokkaido is described to illustrate such faunal situation of the Hidaka and the Yubari mountains. From the distribution of alpine trechines, Hokkaido is divided into four regions. Generally speaking, the two southern regions are zoogeographically closer to Honshu than to the northern ones. Of the southern two, the Hidaka-Yubari area is more directly related to Honshu, though the distance from the northern tip of Honshu is much larger to the Hidaka area than to the southwestern part of Hokkaido. Such an affinity has probably been resulted from a transmarine immigration of the ancestor of the Trechiama species. Of Trechiama, five species and a subspecies have been known from these mountains. They are : Trechiama borealis S. UENO from Mt. Tottabetsu-dake and Mt. Poroshiri-dake (with subsp. petegariensis nov. from Mt. Petegari-dake), T. teradai sp. nov. from Mt. Rakko-dake, T. minutus sp. nov. from Mt. Petegari-dake, T. watanabei sp. nov. from Mt. Tottabetsu-dake, and T. inflexus sp. nov. from Mt. Ashibetsu-dake and Mt. Yubari-dake. Masuzoa is monotypic, but the type-species is distinguished into two subspecies. The nominate subspecies notabilis S. UENO is endemic to Mt. Poroshiri-dake, while subsp. favonius nov. occurs on Mt. Ashibetsu-dake.

N2  - Studies on the vertical distribution of ants was carried out in the southern district of of the Hidaka Mountains, which were lacking in myrmecological data. In this expeditional studies, 26 species of ants were collected from Mts. Petegari, Apoi and Rakko. Most of them were the species widely distributed in Hokkaido; further the typical mountain ants, such as Leptothorax acervorum and Myrmica kurokii, were also discovered on the slopes of relatively high altitude. The vertical distribution of ants would be characterized as mixed or overlapped distribution pattern between mountainous and lowland elements, probably due to the relatively low altitude and the high timber-line.

N2  - In Hokkaido, the northernmost main island of Japan, there lie several distinctive high mountain ranges. Except for Mt. Daisetsu, the highest range on the island, the avifauna of those mountains has not been reported. I conducted field works in the Hidaka mountains in summers of 1960 and 1970,and together with previous reports for Mt. Daisetsu (KOBAYASHI, 1931 a, 1940; YAMASHINA, 1935) the following 34 species are recorded as the alpine avifauna in Hokkaido (asterisks mark regular breeding species).

N2  - Japanese species of the Calypogeia neesiana complex include C. neesiana (var. japonica), C. subalpina, C. granditexta and C. mulleriana. In the present paper, a critical revision on this species complex was made, in relation to the chromosome studies on the materials collected on the Hidaka Mts., Hokkaido. 1. Calypogeia subalpina INOUE has two chromosome races, n=9 and 18. This species should be regarded as a geographical subspecies of C. neesiana by that the leaf-cells always have distinctly punctate-verrucosed cuticle. The oil-body type and other important charactristics of C. subalpina are nearly the same with those of C. neesiana. Calypogeia neesiana (MASS. et CAR.) LOSKE subsp. subalpina (INOUE) INOUE, comb. nov. Basionym : Calypogeia subalpina INOUE, Journ. Jap. Bot. 37 : 103 (1962). Subsp. subalpina is almost restricted to the Pinus pumila forest zone of Hokkaido and Honshu, and its substrata include humus and decaying logs. 2. Japanese "Calypogeia neesiana" or "C. neesiana var. japonica" hitherto reported should be referred to C. integristipula STEPH. This species has n=9 chromosomes. In Japan, this species is distributed in the Fagus crenata forest or subalpine coniferous forest and its substrata include humus, decaying woods, and sometimes soil-containing humus. 3. Calypogeia granditexta STEPH. seems to be differentiated from C. mulleriana in Japan and it is always dioecious having n=9 chromosomes. C. mulleriana hitherto reported from Japan should be referred to C. integristipula, C. granditexta, or C. neesiana subsp. subalpina.

N2  - The Japan-Sea side element has been recognized as one of the important elements that constitute the Japanese flora. Considering the distributional pattern of flowering plants, FUKUOKA (1965,1966) has recognized two groups of different origin in the Japan-Sea side elements. One is temperate plants (=temperate element) which may have dispersed from Central China through Manchuria and Korea, and the other is arctic and northern plants which may have come down from Sakhalin or from further northern regions. Having the new materials at hand, we have attempted to present the distribution maps in this and forthcoming papers for the Japan-Sea side elements and also revised the taxonomic relationship between the species and its allies. Out of the Japan-Sea side elements, the following taxa are reported in this paper as the northern species among the Japan-Sea side elements in the Sympetalae. 1) Artemisia schmidtiana MAXIM. 2) Cacalia auriculata DC. var. kamtschatica (MAXIM.) MATSUM. 3) Pennellianthus frutescens (LAMB.) CROSSWHITE 4) Fauria crista-galli (MENZIES) MAKINO 5) Gentiana nipponica MAXIM. 6) Swertia tetrapetala PALLAS 7) Primula cuneifolia LEDEB. (s. l.) 8) Harrimanella stelleriana (PALL.) Cov. Although Rhododendron albrechtii MAXIM. is cited up in this paper, further studies are necessary as to the taxonomic relationship among this species and its allies. Outside of the above list, Mimulus sessilifolius MAXIM. and Primula jesoana MIQ. have been considered as the northern elements of Japan-Sea side. The allies of these species are not distributed in northern regions. Thus, these two species had better be considered as the temperate elements.

N2  - In this parper the author discusses about the plutonism and metamorphism of the Hidaka metamorphic belt and the period of these activities, the stratigraphic division and geologic age of the strata older than the Yezo group in the axial zone of Hokkaido, the green schists in the upper reaches of the Tokachi River, and the Mesozoic to Paleozoic formations in southern Hokkaido. The axial zone of Hokkaido is marked with two large tectonic zones running parallel in the north-south direction. The one on the east is called the Hidaka belt, centering on the Hidaka metamorphic belt which is characterized by volcanic and plutonic activities. The one on the west is known as the Kamuikotan belt, being composed of the Kamuikotan metamorphic rocks of chiefly dynamo-metamorphic origin. It is often difficult to define the boundary between the two belts. As to the structural significance of the Toyokoro-Kitami belt, the views are divergent. The age of the green schists in the upper reaches of the Tokachi River remains undetermined. Some geologists hold a view that the Hidaka and Kamuikotan metamorphic belts were formed as a pair, but these belts in Saghalien Island are apparently independent of each other. So, further investigations are needed for the belts in Hokkaido. Formation of the Hidaka metamorphic belt began with the forerunning intrusive activity of diabase which gave rise to the deposition of the Sorachi group. However, opinion is divided on the process of formation of fissures that provided a stage for intrusion and effusion of the diabase. Little is known about the status of the basement upon which the Hidaka geosyncline, or the Yezo geosyncline in a broad sense, was developed. Difficulties are experienced in dividing, either lithologically or stratigraphically, the strata developed in the Hidaka belt. Divisions hitherto proposed by various investigators are more or less problematical in some points. In some places the diabase, whose activity is supposed to have an intimate relation with the Sorachi group, is found to cut across the plane of exfoliation of slate that was formed in the portion penetrated by the diabase. Therefore, whether the intrusion of the diabase was contemporaneous with the phyllitization is questionable. The age of the Intra-Sorachi Orogeny which took place during the deposition of the Sorachi group may be late Jurassic or early Cretaceous, although the scale and the character of the movement are not very clear. The metamorphism in the Kamuikotan metamorphic belt may have begun simultaneously with that of the Hidaka metamorphic belt, but it was completed in the period of the Intra-Yezo Orogeny or in the Epi-Sorachi Orogeny at the earliest. In the Hidaka metamorphic belt, however, activity of gabbro and subsequent migmatization took place under a condition of stress which changed free afterwards, followed by intrusion of gabbro-amphibolite and granite. The uprise of the Hidaka metamorphic belt involves many problems. The thrust fault, which marks the western border of the Hidaka metamorphic belt, pushed and folded the Cretaceous system between the Hidaka and the Kamuikotan metamorphic belts. The gabbro-amphibolite exposed along the Cretaceous system is believed to be closely related to the thrust fault. This is the latest gabbroic activity in the Hidaka metamorphic belt, and pebbles of the gabbro-amphibolite are found in the Tertiary formation of the Urahoro coal field. Accordingly, the thrust fault must have been most active in the Epi-Cretaceous orogenic time.

N2  - The sedimentary rocks which constitute the Tsushima Shimo-shima Island, belong to the Lower and Middle Formations of the Taishu Group, probably of the early Tertiary. The Lower Formation, at least 1,600 m thick, consists of gray fine- to medium-grained sandstone, black massive siltstone and shale, and is intruded by eight or more sills and sheets of quartz-porphyry. The Middle Formation, at least 900 m thick, consists of black massive siltstone and shale accompanying thin layers of fine-grained sandstone and three or four intrusive sills and dykes of quartz-porphyry. It seems that the Lower Formation was deposited in the deltaic front whereas the Middle Formation was deposited on the open shelf. The structural framework of this area is composed of the Wakata synclinolium and two anticlinolium; namely, Izuhara-Kamisaka anticlinolium, situated in the eastern part of Shimo-shima Island, and the Komoda anticlinolium, located in the western part.

N2  - In the Taishu Flora (TATEIWA, 1934) the writer recognized four phytozones; namely, Kotsuki, Wakata, Mitsushima and Kushi in ascending order. The Kotsuki phytozone may be one of the early Oligocene floras in Japan. It contains three characteristic species, Equisetites kitamurae, Myrica sp. and Sterculia sp. The Wakata and Mitsushima phytozones accompany the Oligocene fauna which bears some resemblance to the Yoldia zone of the Poronai shale bed in Hokkaido. The characteristic species of these phytozones are Araucaria sp., Sequoia langsdorfii, Taxodium sp., Sabalites taishuensis, Machilus sp., Liquidambar sp. and Mallotus sp. In the writer's judgement, the Kushi phytozone belongs to the Neogene flora in which characteristic species are Cinnamomum sp., Hamamelites cfr. inaequalis and Garrya cfr. axelrodi. As a result, the writer is convinced that the age of the Taishu Group ranges from the Oligocene to the early Miocene.

N2  - A survey was made on the digenetic trematodes of fishes in the sea north of the Tsushima Islands, the gateway of the warm Tsushima Current to the Sea of Japan, during the period July 21 to August 5,1968,and July 25 to August 5,1969. A total of 308 of 83 species of fishes were examined, from which 123 species of 21 families of digenetic trematodes were obtained (Tables 1 & 2). ZHUKOV (1960) examined the fish parasites in the sea around Putjatin Island near Uladivostok and discussed the zoogeography of the fish parasites in the Sea of Japan. According to him, the parasite fauna in the Sea of Japan is divided roughly into two parts, the northwestern and the southeastern parts on account of the influence of the cold Liman and the warm Tsushima Current respectively. Until now, 54 species of digenetic trematodes from the northwestern part and 55 species from the southeastern part have been reported, of which 13 species are common in the two parts. Compared with our survey, the species of digenetic trematodes in the sea near the Tsushima Islands are most abundant. On the other hand, only four species, Opecoelus sphaericus, Derogenes varicus, Lecithocladium excisum and Bianium hemistoma, are common between the sea around Putjatin Island and the sea near the Tsushima Islands. This indicates that the parasite fauna differs in proportion as the difference in latitude becomes greater and the parasites are more abundant as the latitude advances southwards in the Sea of Japan. A defailed report on the digenetic trematodes and other parasites in the sea north of the Tsushima Islands will be published in the future.

N2  - Plankton investigation in the adjacent waters off the Islands of Tsushima was carried out betwen July 25 and August 5,1968. The water temperature in the superficial layer is not uniform horizontally, and it varies from 22.8℃ to 27.5℃. The highest is in the southern waters off Tsushima and decreases towards the nothern parts of the Tsushima and Korea Straits. The water is relatively transparant and its transparency varies between 12 and 25 meters. The stations showing about 15 meters locate at the nothern part of Tsushima, near Iki Island, the Sea of Genkai-nada, where the coastal and offshore waters are mixed together and inshore diatoms are numerous. The settled volume of plankton per m^3 of sea water varies from 0.5 to 8.2 cc. The highest is in the southern waters and it gradually decreases towards the Sea of Genkai-nada and off Iki Island. The total number of plankton per m^3 of sea water varies between 1.8×10^3 and 10.5×10^3,and the highest is at the Sea of Genkai-nada, where coastal and inshore forms are numerous. Forty-one species of Dinoflagellates occur, of which 35 are oceanic warm water form, 4 are widespread form and the other 2 are neritic. Seventeen species of Tintinnida ciliates appear. Nine of them are oceanic, warm water form, and 6 are neritic or inshore forms. There are, however, 2 species which are ordinarily found in Japanese coastal waters during the cold season but are distributed sparsely at the northern stations off Tsushima, where water temperature shows relatively low. A few Foraminifera, Radiolaria and Hydromedusae appear, and these groups are almost oceanic warm water life. Thirty-two of Copepoda occur widely in this area, and these are the most dominant component of pelagic communities. Twenty-three of them are oceanic tropical and subtropical warm water forms, and appear more numerous at the Korea Straits The neritic and inshore forms are found in the southern waters off Tsushima, Iki Island through the Sea of Genkai-nada. Larval forms of benthic animals in these surveyed areas are not more than in the inshore waters, but distributed widely over all the stations. Sixty-five species of pelagic diatoms including chiefly neritic forms are collected. They dominate at the southern part of Tsushima, near Iki Island and the Sea of Genkai-nada. Thus, the plankton communities are composed of the mixed communities of the oceanic and neritic groups, such as diatoms, dinoflagellates, holopelagic animals together with larval forms of benthic lives. The cold water forms existing in the Yellow Sea or the southern coastal waters of Korea are not found at all in both the straits during this survey.

N2  - For the purpose of obtaining an information on the marine algal flora and the communities, both intertidal and sublittoral collections of marine algae were made at 13 localities along the coast of the Tsushima Islands in March and July, 1969. From the results of our present survey, it is found that there are 231 species of marine algae. Of these, 40 are species belonging to the Chlorophyceae, 1 to the Prasinophyceae, 60 to the Phaeophyceae, 1 to the Cyanophyceae, and the rest to the Rhodophyceae. From the viewpoint of the geographical distribution, this area has a marine flora represented in the main by temperate elements, with co-existence of a considerable number of subtropical species, such as Microdictyon japonicum, Dictyosphaeria cavernosa, Halimeda discoidea, Acetabularia mobii, Pockockiella variegata, Liagora japonica, and Bostrichia tenella. It is interesting that among four species of the algae thought by OKAMURA (1931) to be an element characteristic of the Japan Sea, the three, Ecklonia stolonifera, Coccophora langsdorfii, and Grateloupia divaricata, were not found in this area, and only Sargassum confusum was present along the northeastern part of the Islands. The vertical distribution of marine algae in the intertidal region in this coast occurs in zones as follows, in descending order : Monostroma nitidum - Porphyra suborbiculata - Gloiopeltis furcata Ishige sinicola - Ishige okamurai - Myelophycus simplex Hizikia fusiforme - Sargassum thunbergii - Corallina pilulifera Eisenia bicyclis - Sargassum spp. - Laurencia spp. It is fundamentally similar to that found in the central part of Japan facing the Pacific Ocean. However, it should be pointed out that this coast lacks in the intertidal region the Chondrus- and the Gigartina tenella-belt, both occur in common along the Pacific coast of central Japan. The vertical distribution of marine algae at Tojushi, Tsushima, in the intertidal zone is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig.4,comparing with that of the Rikuchu National Park, Sanriku Coast and Shimoda, Izu Peninsula.

N2  - Among thirteen land mammal forms known from the Tsushima Islands, ten are undoubtedly native and three are commensal. Four groups are recognized among the native forms. 1. Korean forms, which are common to Korea but not found in Hondo, the mainland of Japan, in specific level : Crocidura suaveolens shantungensis, Mogera coreana, Mustela sibirica manchurica, Prionailurus bengalensis euptilurus. 2. Forms which are common both to Korea and Hondo in specific level : Micromys minutus aokii, Martes melampus tsuensis. 3. Japanese forms, which are common to Hondo in specific level, but not found in Korea : Apodemus navigator tusimaensis, Apodemus argenteus sagax. 4. Endemic species : Urotrichus adversus, Cervus pulchellus. Any taxonomic differences have never been discovered between specimens of the "Korean forms" and those from Korea. This may suggest that the Tsushimas had a land connection with Korea not in so remote past. The forms belonging to the second group seem to be intermediate between Korean and Japanese forms in subspecific level. "Japanese forms" evidently differ subspecifically or specifically from those of Kyushu, which are in the nearest districts of Hondo from the Tsushima Islands. Lineages, or phylogenetic branches, within Urotrichus were tried to be detected by statistical comparison of relative sizes between several local populations and a cline of well established form, U. hondonis (Figs. 1-5). By those clinal analysis, based on the author's taxonomic principles, at least four lineages were recognized in the group. According to sequence of expansions of forms in the past, which can be estimated by present distributions and degrees of morphological specializations or grades in strength, those lineages can be divided into classes, such as the most recent : lineage A, the next : lineage B, etc. Urotrichus adversus from Tsushima seems to belong to the lineage B, evidently older than U. talpoides of Kyushu belonging to the lineage A. Apodemus navigator tusimaensis is rather similar to navigator of Oki Is. and dorsalis of Yaku and Tane Is., which probably belong to the lineage B and are different from speciosus of Hondo belonging to the lineage A. Thus, most of the "Japanese forms" of Tsushima may not be derived from populations of Kyushu, belonging to the lineage A, but may perhaps be the relics of formerly widespread forms.

Murina tenebrosa YOSHIYUKI, 1970 The above-mentioned species, with the exception of Nyctalus lasiopterus aviator and Murina aurata ussuriensis, were examined by the author. Among them, Murina tenebrosa strikingly differs from the other living forms of the same genus by several important external and cranial characters, and undoubtedly belongs to a new species. Pipistrellus abramus, collected in a mine at Kasayama, Kamiagata-cho, Kamiagata-gun, Tsushima Is., is newly recorded from Tsushima and Pipistrellus savii coreensis, collected at Izuharamachi, Shimoagata-gun, Tsushima Is., on September, 1969,is the second record of the species from the Tsushima Islands. The chiropteran fauna of Tsushima is very complicated. The members constituting the fauna are divided into four distinct groups according to their distribution. 1) The endemic forms : -Murina tenebrosa, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ssp. 2) The forms common to Tsushima and Korea at subspecific level : -Myotis formosus tsuensis, Pipistrellus savii coreensis. 3) The forms common to Tsushima and Japan at subspecific level : -Rhinolophus cornutus cornutus, Myotis macrodactylus. 4) The forms common to Tsushima, Korea and Japan at subspecific level : -Pipistrellus abramus, Miniopterus schreibersi fuliginosus, Nyctalus lasiopterus aviator, Murina aurata ussuriensis.

N2  - The Tsushima Islands lie between the Korean Peninsula and Kyushu, and because of the situation of the islands its biogeographical position has been much in dispute for many years. In birds, KURODA (1925) suggested that the avifauna of Tsushima is a part of the Korean avifauna and included Tsushima in the Korean subregion chiefly because of the presence of the Tristram's Woodpecker and the absence of the Copper Pheasant in both Tsushima and Korea. His view has been followed in the ornithological literature, although some recent authors regarded the Tsushima avifauna as a mixed fauna of the Korean and Japanese avifaunas. The number of the bird species known from the Tsushima Islands has been increased greatly since the KURODA's time. The biogeographical position of the Tsushima avifauna may therefore be reexamined in the light of the information available today. In an analysis of breeding land birds, it is shown that the avifauna of Tsushima is closer to that of southern Japan (Shikoku and Kyushu) than to that of South Korea despite the distribution of the Tristram's Woodpecker and Copper Pheasant. This is largely due to some fifteen species of Korean birds whose distribution is limited by the Straits of Korea. Although a number of the species of southern origin have invaded Korea via Tsushima, the Tristram's Woodpecker is in fact the only Korean bird that has reached Tsushima across the Korea Straits. The avifaunas of South Korea, Tsushima and southern Japan are, however, essentially the same, the difference between them being much less than that between the avifaunas of South and North Korea or that between southern and northern Japan, and no biogeographical line can be drawn either between Kyushu and Tsushima or between Tsushima and Korea. The avifauna of the Japanese Islands consists chiefly of three distributional elements. (a) The northern element which has reached Japan via Sakhalin and the Kuriles and is predominant down to the central part of Honshu, though some species extend their ranges farther south to Taiwan. (b) The southern element which has invaded Japan via the Ryukyu Islands. Korea has also been invaded by this element via Tsushima. (c) Also the southern element, of which the center of distribution is in southern Japan. The species belonging to this element are endemic to Japan or nearly so, and have therefore much older history in Japan than the species of the other two elements. Furthermore, they have no apparent relatives on the Chinese mainland, and their relatives must be sought in western China (Szechwan and Yunnan) or in the Himalalyas. Sapheopipo noguchii of Okinawa and Garrulus lidthi of the Amami Group also belong to this element. The Tristram's Woodpecker, whose closest relative is Dryocopus j. forresti of Yunnan, may be another example of this element. If this is the case, the Tristram's Woodpecker may have originated somewhere in southern Japan, but has been exterminated after part of the population succeeded to colonize Tsushima and Korea. (d) Korea has received the other element which is Chinese or Gobi Desert in origin and extend their ranges to Korea or Ussuriland via southern Manchuria. A dozen of the species of this element have reached South Korea, but few, if any, have been successful in crossing the Korea Straits. The biogeographical position of the Tsushima Islands is discussed in relation to these four elements.

N2  - The reptiles and amphibians of the Islands of Tsushima have repeatedly been studied by previous workers, because of their biogeographic importance as a stepping stone between the Korean Peninsula and West Japan. At least eighteen terrestrial and freshwater species of these animals have been recorded from these islands, but the number was reduced to twelve by GORIS (1965), who himself made a herpetological survey of the islands in the summer of 1965. Two of the twelve species, Bufo bufo japonicus and Rana catesbeiana, were proved to have been artificially introduced from West Japan, so that the number of the native species became ten according to his investigation. On the other hand, the occurrence of Rana chensinensis dybowskii and of Takydromus amurensis in the Tsushimas was subsequently reported by UEDA (1969) and SHIBATA (1966) respectively, and was confirmed by the zoolgists who participated in the collecting trips made in 1968 and 1969 as a part of the Natural History Research Project of the National Science Museum, Tokyo. No specimen of the other problematical species was obtained by the research project, their occurrence in the Tsushimas still remaining to be confirmed in the future. Thus, the number of the reptiles and amphibians native to the Islands of Tsushima amounts to twelve so far as we have confirmed up to the present. Their names are given at page 194 of the present articale. Of these, the four species, Hyla arborea japonica, Geoclemys reevesii, Gekko japonicus and Agkistrodon halys, occur both in the Korean Peninsula and in the Japanese main islands, and seem to have immigrated from the former into the latter through the ancient Tsushimas, with the exception of the gecko which no doubt invaded Tsushima from West Japan and then immigrated into Korea. The two species, Clemmys japonica and Elaphe climacophora, are endemic to the Japanese Islands and show little geographical variation. Their immigration into the Tsushimas seems to have taken place in rather a recent period, since there exists no perceptible difference between the Tsushima and the mainland populations of these species. Both of them are primarily lowland inhabitants, have rather a high tolerance for the change of environmental factors, and can easily cross small barriers. Hynobius tsuensis is the unique salamander endemic to the Islands of Tsushima. Its affinity and derivation were discussed by OYAMA (1930), SATO (1943) and others, though no definite opinion has been established. Morphologically, it is somewhat closer to H. nebulosus of West Japan than to H. leechii of Korea and Manchuria. As all the Japanese salamanders of the nebulosus group seem to have been derived from the mother stock of the Asiatic Mainland, the Tsushima population can be regarded as a relict that was left in that area during the southeastward dispersal of the ancestral forms of the species-group. The remaining five species are common between the Tsushimas and Korea, but do not occur in the Japanese main islands. Most of them become differentiated into geographical races, and though two of the five are much more widely distributed and seemingly older in derivation than the others, all can be regarded as "old" species which are less dominant than newly developed ones. They had probably reached Tsushima at an earlier period, ever since settled there, and in certain cases differentiated into endemic subspecies. Their southward dispersal has been barred by the Tsushima Straits, which have, on the other hand, not constituted an effective barrier against the dispersal of more dominant species.

N2  - A survey of the fly fauna of the Tsushima Islands was made in June, 1969. As the results, 4 families, 35 genera and 60 species of calypterate muscoid flies were obtained and listed in the present paper. The fly fauna of the Islands of Tsushima has been little known taxonomically. SENIOR-WHITE (1924) reported the new species, Sarcophaga tsushimae, from Iki Island in his paper of the Oriental Sarcophagidae. This was the only record of the fly from Iki and the Tsushima Islands. No species endemic to the islands were obtained during this survey. Two new species, Megophyra multisetosa and Muscina nigra, were found; however, they were not endemic but common with Honshu and Amami-oshima Island. Among the collected species, only P. macroauriculata was common with the Korean Peninsula and the other species except newly found species were common with the Japanese Main Islands. It had been supposed that two sarcophagid flies, B. haemorrhoidalis and P. knabi, whose larvae feed on human feces, and which are easily spread out artificially, have entered into the Tsushima Islands, but they were not found in this survey. However, it is possible that they will enter into the Tsushima Islands or into the Japanese Main Islands in future. Six of sarcophagid and two of calliphorid flies which are endemic to Japan, were obtained in the Tsushima Islands, namely B. japonensis HORI, P. tsushimae (SENIOR-WHITE), P. kawayuensis (KANO), P. fieldi KANO, P. kagaensis (HORI), S. musashinensis (KANO et OKAZAKI), P. japonica KANO et SHINONAGA, and I. prasina (BIGOT). Presence of these flies shows that fly fauna of the Islands of Tsushima is similar to that of the western part of Japan. On the contrary, fly fauna of the Korean Peninsula is the Europe-China type, as is indicated by the presence of Ravinia striata, Robineauella pseudoscoparia, Parasarcophaga pingi, Parasarcophaga gigas, Parasarcophaga kanoi, Calliphora vomitoria and Phormia regina. These species have not been found in the Islands of Tsushima. Four species, Limnophora prominens, Gymnodia nigrogrisea, Xenosina pudica rufomarginata, and Phaonia fuscata, were newly recorded from Japan. Dichaetomyia kaga and Isomyia senomera were regarded in this paper as the synonyms of D. bibax and I. prasina respectively.

N2  - The pentatomomorphous Heteroptera of Tsushima are dealt with in the present article, in which are listed 105 species under 82 genera. No endemic genera or species are found among them. From the distributional pattern of pentatomomorphous genera of the four areas, the Korean Peninsula, Quelpart Island, Tsushima and Kyushu Proper, the Tsushima fauna is proved to be composed primarily of the Kyushu elements and secondarily of the peninsular or continental ones. The fauna of Kyushu includes many southern elements and greatly affects to that of Tsuhsima possibly because of the shorter distance. The latter shows the dependence degree of 75.6% on that of Peninsular Korea and 98.9% on that of Kyushu Proper. Of the nine East Asiatic genera (seven of which are restricted to the Japan Sea coasts), Aenaria and Yemma are seen east of the Korea Straits, Acrocorisellus and Okeanos west of the straits, and Prosomoeus east of the Cheju Straits. Of the four remaining genera (common to both the Korean Peninsula and Kyushu), the two, Iodinus and Togo, are found in the Tsushima Islands. This means that the Korea Straits form an important barrier for the distribution of Pentatomomorpha but the Tsushima Straits do not. Some southern elements spread over Japan and Korea. Of the three distinctive genera, Dalpada, Placosternum and Anoplocnemis, known from Korea but not from Japan, the first genus is found in Quelpart Island and the second in the Tsushima Islands, but the third is restricted to the peninsular area. There are more genera of southern elements found east of the Cheju Straits, the Korea Straits and the Tsushima Straits respectively. Each of these straits acts as a barrier for dispersal and the Korea Straits may be more effective than the others. The distribution at species level also shows the presence of barriers between Quelpart Island and Tsushima (Carbula putoni, C. humerigera, Arma tubercula and Tropidothorax hanseni), Tsushima and Kyushu Proper (Pentatoma semiannulata), and the Korean Peninsula and Quelpart Island. Infraspecific variation in some Pentatomomorpha of Tsushima is also considered. The present material indicates that Tsushima plays a role as a step in distribution from the continent to Kyushu (and also Japan) and at the same time forms a bridge from Kyushu over the Tsushima Straits. The present pentatomomorphous fauna of Tsushima almost entirely depends on the fauna of Kyushu Proper (except for a single continental genus and three continental species belonging to three different genera).

N2  - No biospeological works have hitherto been made in the Islands of Tsushima. This is largely due to the lack of natural cavities in these islands, though the occurrence of certain phreaticolous animals has been known in the town of Izuhara. During the collecting trip to the Tsushimas made in the autumn of 1969 as a part of the Natural History Research Project of the National Science Museum, Tokyo, the authors endeavoured to collect subterranean animals at various places of the islands. They examined the waters from twentyeight wells and explored an abandoned mine, obtaining a considerable number of small animals belonging to many groups. Some of them (e. g., turbellarians, archiannelids, freshwater worms, etc.) were not satisfactorily fixed and not useful for taxonomic studies. Most of the specimens of the other groups are, however, in good condition and are now being studied by the specialists of respective animals. It seems premature to delineate at this moment the characteristics of the subterranean fauna of the Tsushimas, since several important groups of animals (e. g., ostracods, cyclopoid copepods, springtails, etc.) have not been identified yet. However, it can safely be said that in the underground domain of the Tsushimas, terrestrial forms are very poor as compared with aquatic ones, and that the fauna as a whole shows a closer relationship with that of Korea than to that of West Japan. The latter phenomenon is especially apparent in malacostracan crustaceans and other animals of archaic type. On the contrary, the forms that are closely related to the West Japanese fauna seem to be relatively recent in their origin. They are usually not much differentiated, with the exception of mideopsid water mites, whose speciation may have been accomplished rather rapidly after the isolation of the Islands of Tsushima.

N2  - Up to the present, about 1100 species of flowering plants have been found in the Islands of Tsushima. The similarity between the floras of Japan (including the Islands of Tsushima) and Korea was emphasized by Y. YABE (1904), though he enumerated only 637 species fromthe Tsushimas. In his study of woody plants of the Islands of Tsushima, T. NAKAI (1922,1928) came to the conclusion that the flora of the Tsushima Islands was more similar to the flora of Japan than to that of Korea. Their opinions are based on the contrast of the number of species concerning the flora of the neigbouring regions. Considering the paleogeography of the Japanese Islands and the Asiatic Continent in addition to the speculation on the origin of species, G. KOIDZUMI (1919,1931) recognized the elements of Manchuria-Korea, Central China and so on in the flora of Japan, though he did not particularly mentioned about the flora of the Islands of Tsushima. Recently, H. HARA (1959) gave the outline of the phytogeography of the Tsushimas. Taxonomic comment on each species, however, has not been given by these authors. Having the new materials at hand, the authors have attempted to analyze in this paper the phytogeography of the flora of Japan and also discussed on the taxonomic relationship between the species and its allies. Out of the flowering plants in the Islands of Tsushima, Compositae, Caprifoliaceae and Leguminosae are studied by H. KOYAMA, N. FUKUOKA and H. OHASHI respectively. The distributional maps are drawn from the localities of the specimens kept in the following herbaria. The indication of those herbaria is in accordance with the general use. KYO Harbarium of Kyoto University, Kyoto. TI Herbarium of Tokyo University, Tokyo. TNS The National Science Museum, Tokyo. E Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. A The Arnold Arboretum, Cambridge. Grateful acknowledgement is herewith made to the directors and curators of these herbaria. Phytogeographically, the flora of the Islands of Tsushima consists of the following three groups which are of different origin. In the following enumeration, the species marked by a single asterisk is endemic to the Tsushimas and those by double ones are endemic to Japan.

N2  - In the early spring of 1969,the author visited the Tsushima Islands located between the main Islands of Kyushu and Korea. A total of 418 packets of mosses, comprising 343 packets collected by the author and 75 packets by Dr. IWATSUKI, were studied through this work. Among them identified 102 species in which 29 species were new addition to the moss flora of the Islands. As reported by AMAKAWA & OSADA (1956), the moss flora of the Islands is composed mainly of the Holarctic and Asiatic-holarctic elements and partially of the tropical and subtropical ones. In this paper, however, twenty-nine species of mosses are reported to be new to the Islands. Of these species, Dicranoloma cylindrothecium, Theriotia lorifolia, Entodon curvatirameus, etc. have been known previously only from Korea and the southern half of the main Islands of Japan and southward. The ranges of the tropical species, such as Orthomniopsis japonica, Homaliadelphus targionianus, etc., were extended so far to the Tsushima Islands from the southern half of the main Islands of Japan. The close relationships between the floras of Korea, main islands of Japan, and the Tsushima Islands reported by AMAKAWA & OSADA (1956) were confirmed by the present data.

N2  - The hepatic flora of the Tsushima Islands (111 species in total) is characterized by high percentage of species distributed mainly in western Japan (66 species; ca. 60%) and in paleotropical region (24 species; ca. 21%); the rest (21 species; ca. 19%) belongs to the temperate holarctic element and/or ubiquitous species. All of the Hepaticae of the Tsushima Islands are very common in lowland of western Japan and 61 species of them (ca. 55%) are also distributed in southern Korea (most of which seem to have the distribution center in western Japan). These percentages in dicate that the hepatic flora of the Tsushima Islands is included in the lowland hepatic flora of western Japan. None of the species can be considered to migrate from subarctic or continental Assia through the Korean Peninsula and Tsushima Islands into the Japanese Islands.

N2  - The epiphytic bryophyte communities of 14 sample trees at three stations on Mt. Tatera and Mt. Ariake were studied. A total of 49 species of bryophytes (24 mosses and 25 hepatics) were recorded on the sample trees. Vertical distribution, degree of cover, constancy, and correlations between phorophytes and epiphytic bryophytes are shown on the tables. The epiphytic bryophyte communities of the islands are poorly-developed in both quantity and number of species, commpared with those in other areas of Kyushu.

N2  - In this paper, seventy-three species of higher fungi are reported from the Islands of Tsushima on the basis of authors' collections in Autumn (October) of 1968,and in the rainy season (July) and in Autumn (November) of 1969. No species characteristic of Korea, China, or China, or Himalayas was found on the Islands. Some species which have heen considered to be endemic to the Japan Archipelago, in contrast, were collected on the Islands. Five species generally distributed in warm temperate or subtropical zones were collected on the Islands. All of them have also been reported from other warmer regions of Japan. Phaeocreopsis hypoxyloides was described from South America. It was recently recorded from two localities in Japan, the Islands of Tsushima and Shikoku. In addition, the species was collected at the foot (about 3,000m above sea level) of Mt. Wilhelm in New Guinea.

N2  - The result of the geological reconnaissance work (Fig. 1), which was performed by KON'NO and MATSUMOTO (1944,unpublished report), is briefly described, since it is essentially correct in the light of up-to-date information. Tsushima consists primarily of the Taishu Group. It is about or over 2500 m thick, consisting of shale and sandstone, with swampy sediments in the lower part, neritic fine-sandy siltstone in the middle, and alternating sandstone and shale, with prominent arenite at several levels, in the upper. The group represents a cycle of sedimentation under deltaic to shallow sea environments. The available evidence of fossils (plants, mollusks, echinoids, etc.) suggests a lower Tertiary age but is not sufficient for further precise age determination. The strata of the Taishu Group show a rather shallow, Jura-type folded structure. Several anticlinoria and synclinoria run en echelon in NE-SW direction, plunging to NE (Fig. 2). The folding is more intense in the northwest. Minor folds, with wave length of 0.5-2 km, show a number of interesting features (Figs. 3-6). The Taishu Group is intruded by sills and dykes of quartz-porphyry and porphyrite and by bosses of granite and smaller bodies of gabbro or diabase. These igneous rocks may be of late Miocene age, as in those of the Goto islands, off northwest Kyushu. Some discussions are extended to the major geological problems related to the islands of Tsushima and surrounding area, such as geological province, geological cycle, basement beneath or under the Taishu Group, younger Tertiary and Quaternary history, petrologic province, and submarine geology.

N2  - As part of the first year survey of the Second Natural History Research Program of the Japanese Islands by our Museum, the writers studied the topography and bottom sediments of the Tsushima Straits, and obtained the general features as reported preliminarily in this paper. These and other features, however, would be elucidated in more detail by many other works, including those of the writers themselves, which are under way and will be reported in the next issue of the Memoirs. As shown in Fig. 2,the bottom relief of the part east of the Tsushima Islands, i.e. Tsushima Straits (s.s.), is rather even except for some weak rises and grooves trending in a NNE-SSW direction, whereas a prominent trough, Tsushima Trough, exists just west of and along the whole length of the Tsushima Islands in the Korea Straits. The eastern wall of the trough is rather straight and so steep that it seems to be a fault scarp or fault-line scarp, in contrast with the western wall which rises gently up to a shallow bench surrounding the southern coast of Korea. The Tsushima Islands are located near the middle of the Tsushima Straits (s.l.) and its topography and geology seem to offer an important key for understanding the nature of the strait. General topographic features of the islands reflect very well the difference of hardness of the constituent rocks as exemplified in a summit-level map (Fig. 3), which shows a plain, about 250 to 200m above the sea-level, covering almost throughout the islands. At the present it is difficult to decide whether the plain was formed by peneplanation or by wave-abrasion. If the peneplanation was existent, its evidence should be found in Kyushu, but no paper has ever reported it. Besides the summit-level, the geologic structure accompanied by folding and many faults with a general trend of NNE-SSW may account for the general shape of the islands with steep and staight cliffs running in the NNW-SSW or N-S direction in many places. Nearly none of the cliffs, however, represents fault scarp differing from the previous opinions (e.g. SATO, 1954; ISHII, 1964). These steep and straight cliffs, no matter whether they are of fault origin or not, may have been formed by uprushing waves and sweep of the Tsushima Current flowing from SSE to NNE in general. As shown in Fig. 2,the islands are completely encircled by a wave-cut bench about 1 to 3km wide and 60m deep at the edge. The sweeping by current, moreover, may have prevented the accumulation of detritus which is expected to occur along the outer side of the bench. The prominent cliffs constituting the major part of the western coast may be defined as fault-line scarps which retreated from the presumable fault or fault-line scarp on the eastern border of the Tsushima Trough. Drowned valleys, another characteristic topography of the islands, can be seen in many places as already pointed out by TAYAMA (1954), though some of them are obscure as their down-stream parts were eroded away. The abrasion seems to advance into submarine valleys or buried valleys, which are supposed to be continuous with the drowned valleys. These drowned valleys cannot be ascribed to a subsidence of land but mainly to a rise of sealevel, because the typical rias coast is observed along the south and west coasts of Korea and the northwestern coast of Kyushu. The maximum invasion of the sea occurred in the prehistoric Jyomon Period of post-glacial age; since then some of the drowned valleys have been buried up as a typical instance was reported from northern Kyushu by YAMAZAKI (1955). It seems that the Tsushima Straits (s.l.), connecting the Sea of Japan with the Pacific, was formed during or a little before the Jyomon Period when the relative subsidence of the region culminated, after the uplifted plain had been remarkably denuded as indicated by the summit-level. According to the charts published by the Hydrographic Office, sand or shell sand covers almost the whole region of the strait, even in the dee

N2  - In late autumn of 1968,seismic reflection measurements were carried out on the continental shelf around the Tsushima Islands. The following results were obtained. 1) A sedimentary basin was discovered on the continental shelf off Shimane Prefecture. The sedimentary basin is assumed to be an extension of the Western Sanin Sedimentary Basin from its geographical situation and thickness of the unconsolidated sediment up to about one kilometer. This area has a possibility to contain mineral resources, particularly petroleum and natural gas. 2) Two sedimentary basins were discovered on the continental shelf SSW and NNE of the Tsushima Islands. The thickness of unconsolidated sediments in these areas exceeds 400 meters. The relation between the two basins failed to be clarified because no survey was made in the west of the islands. However, it is possible that a geosynclinal belt connects these sedimentary basins along the trough running parallel to the west coast of the Tsushima Islands. The geosynclinal belt will be very important geotectonically, if this hypothesis is true and verified by the same writers in the near future after analysis of the seismic data obtained on the continental shelf west of Kyushu, Japan, in 1968 and west of Tsushima in June, 1969.

N2  - Up to the present, five species of trechid beetles have been found in the Islands of Tsushima lying between the Korean Peninsula and the Island of Kyushu, western Japan. They are classified into three different genera, Perileptus, Trechus and Coreoblemus (new genus). The first-named genus comprises three species, P. japonicus, P. laticeps and P. naraensis, all of which have large eyes and well developed hind wings. These species are no doubt of the southern origin and seem to have immigrated into Tsushima from western Japan, where they are widespread. The other two genera contain a single species each, that is, Trechus ephippiatus and Coreoblemus venustus (new species). The former is an oculate and alate species widely distributed in the northern part of the Asian Continent and in the Japanese Islands. Its dispersal must have taken place towards the south and east from the Asian mainland, and the Tsushimas must have served at least as a stepping stone from the Korean Peninsula to western Japan. On the other hand, the latter is apterous, anophthalmic and depigmented, being confined in certain endogean habitats at the heads of glens. Its congeners have hitherto been found only in South Korea, and are highly adapted to subterranean existence. As it has successfully invaded Tsushima but has not crossed the Tsushima Straits, Coreoblemus may be a remnant of an old fauna that existed in the ancient Korean Land, and has probably survived since the preglacial period. The new genus Coreoblemus belongs to the Trechoblemus complex and seems to be closely allied to Stygiotrechus of western Japan. It is, however, easily distinguished from the latter by the glabrous integument and the aberrant chaetotaxy of various parts of body. Since the Tsushima species seems to be a peculiarly modified offshoot, one of the Korean species is selected as the type of this genus and is described under the name C. parvicollis at the end of this paper.

N2  - 1. Dr. Jun-ichi AOKI collected, among others, 57 species of spiders on the Tsushima Islands as a result of his field study of its fauna conducted in October, 1968. Side by side with AOKI's collection, the writer has recently been given an opportunity of identifying the spiders collected by Mr. M. OHNO (1962) and Mr. A. TADA (1967) on the same islands. Concerning the spider fauna of Tsushima, reports were published in the past by Dr. T. UYEMURA (1943), Mr. T. YAMAGUCHI (1955) and YAGINUMA (1966). As a whole, it has now been confirmed that 105 species of spiders can be found on the Tsushima Islands. 2. The new species, Thanatus nipponicus and Coelotes grandivulva, are described in the present report. 3. The species worthy of notice from the view points of their distribution and classification are as follows : 1) Ummidia tsushimensis (KISHIDA) [nom. nud.] The name was reported without description. Presumably the species belongs to U. fragaria (DOENITZ) commonly found in other places. Future confirmation is, therefore, required as to whether spiders referable to this genus can really be found there or not. 2) Araneus bituberculatus (WALCKENAER) This species has an extensive distribution in the Palaearctic region, but its specimens hitherto collected in Japan have been very few and sporadical. The mixed habitation of such a northern species on the islands, is worthy of note. To identify this Japanese species with A. bituberculatus of Europe is problematical, but the author prefers tentatively to regard the former as a Japanese form (one of the geographical variations) of the European species. 3) Paraplectana tsushimensis YAMAGUCHI The type-locality of this species is Tsushima, but its specimens have later been collected in the two prefectures of Ehime and Miyazaki as well as on the islands of Amami-Ohshima and Okinawa. 4) Leucauge blanda (L. KOCH) This species is not particularly rare, but is significant in indicating the occurrence of the southern element in the islands. 5) Synagelides agoriformis STRAND Specimens of this species have been collected in the southern part of the mainland of Japan, Shikoku and Kyushu as well as on the Island of Yakushima, but it is few in the number of individuals. By habit, this species appears to have some relationship with ants. 4. Viewed from the percentage of the specific composition of a family, the mixed habitation of both northern and southern species and various other specific aspects, it is considered that the spider fauna of the Tsushima Islands belongs to the type of warm region. considered that the spider fauna of the Tsushima Islands belongs to the type of warm region. 5. No endemic species has yet been found on the Tsushima Islands. 6. The spider fauna of the Tsushima Islands is of the Japanese type, and no species common exclusively with Korea has yet been found. Consequently, from the zoogeographical view point, the Korea Straits should be considered more important as the barrier for distribution than the Tsushima Straits. 7. The northernmost border line of distribution of southern species of animals and plants, the Honshu southern coastal line, passes near the Tsushima Islands, and therefore, the fauna of the islands bears close resemblance to that of Tokaido Provinces, Central Kinki Area, coastal districts of the Inland Sea of Seto or North Kyushu lying respectively on the same line.

N2  - The Permian and Carboniferous systems distributed in the southern part of the Kitakami Mountainland, Northeast Japan, are summarized on the basis of rock facies as follows : The most striking feature of the geology of the area is the structural difference between the Carboniferous and Permian systems. The Permian System lies unconformably on the inclined older formations separated by an erosion surface. This unconformity, so-called "Pre-Sakamotozawa unconformity", represents the intense disturbance which is known as the "Setamai folding". The erosional surface can be traced over the southern part of the Kitakami Mountainland, and also recognized in the Abukuma Mountainland and the inner zone of Southwest Japan. However, there are many areas where no evidence of the disturbance can be recognized, and if any, the resultant features vary from area to area. Fig.2 shows the distribution of the Carboniferous formations before the deposition of the Permian beds. Distribution of the Hikoroichi, Arisu, and Odaira formations is limited in a N-S extending area of Setamai. The Onimaru Formation is developed on the outerside from the developmental area of these older formations, and the Nagaiwa Formation is widely distributed on the farther [table] outerside. The above-mentioned distributions seem to suggest that before the deposition of the Permian beds the Carboniferous System formed a large anticline or dome with a N-S axis, which extends over the southern part of the Kitakami Mountainland. As a whole, the structure is considered to be the result of a gentle upwarping, although it may have been destroyed and deformed by the older disturbances. The Carboniferous System, accompained by the "Setamai folding", may have been separated into several blocks, and subsidence or uplift of the blocks must have been reflected in the sedimentation of the Permian System. During the "Setamai folding" there must have been a tendency to form the faults of a N-S trend, which is parallel to the long axis of the upwarping structure.

N2  - A seismic profiler survey was undertaken off the Sanriku coast, across the rather wide continental slope with a width 130km and a general dip about one degree. The basement of the major part of the slope is covered with two layers of the younger sediments. The lower transparent layer of the two was deformed concordantly with the rugged surface of the basement, probably due to the same crustal movement, and it is uniform in thickness, while the upper opaque one seems to be a sediment covering the undulated transparent layer, perhaps due to turbidity current. Referring to the data of the seimic refraction survey made by the writers previously (LUDWIG et al., 1966), it may be supposed that the transparent layer has an acoustic velocity of 1.7km/sec, a value corresponding to that of the upper Neogene to Pleistocene sediments, and that the basement possesses the value of 2.5km/sec. At the lower end of the above-mentioned slope at a depth about 2000m, the basement is exposed forming an eroded terrace-like topography with a rather horizontal, though slightly rugged, surface. From the depth below the terrace, i.e., at the points S_1 and S_2 of Fig. 1,IIJIMA and KAGAMI (1961) obtained many pebbles, some of which were regarded to be of the late Miocene or early Pliocene. These rock fragments of the Neogene, therefore, may have been brought from the terrace, not from a distant source, probably by turbidity current.

Hayachine; Hypocrea splendens PHIL. et PLOW. was newly recorded in Japan and Hypocrea subsplendens was described as new to science. H. splendens forms no conidial state in usual media. H. subsplendens has white Trichoderma-type conidial state. These two species are closely related, but they can be distinguished by the characters of ascospores, conidial states, and ecological segregations, especially by the cultural tests of associative effects. In the associated cultures, H. subsplendens grew abnormally under the affections of H. splendens and the hyphae of these species did not anastomose together. I wish to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Y. KOBAYASI for his helpful guidance and suggestions. I also wish to thank to Dr. T. KOBAYASHI of Government Forest Experiment Station for the loan of specimens and for discussions on Hypocrea splendens.

N2  - Mt. Hayachine, 1914m high, is the highest of the Kitakami range, large part of which consists of the Paleozoic rocks. The area from 1100m s.m. up to the summit is composed of serpentine. The mountain is well known for the occurrence of many intercsting higher plants growing on serpentine rocks. On bryophytes of Mt. Hayachine, only one paper has been published (HATTORI, 1957). In the summer of 1959 and also of 1967,the writer collected there about 424 specimens of bryophytes, in which 205 species of mosses were identified. Among them 84 species were collected in the serpentine area. NOGUCHI (1962) reported 45 species of mosses growing on serpentine of Mt. Apoi (810m s.m.) in Hokkaido, and 33 species of them are also found on the same rocks of Mt. Hayachine. Thus close similarity is seen between both floras. The difference in total number of species between the two may be chiefly due to the different altitude. Species listed in text are collected only in the alpine region which consists of serpentine. The species marked with an asterisk are common to those from the same rocks of Mt. Apoi. Except for some species such as Brachythecium populeum, Ceratodon purpureus, Dicranum scoparium, Grimmia apocarpa, Heterophyllium haldanianum, Rhacomitrium carinatum, R. heterostichum and Weissia controversa, which are distributed commonly in the lowland regions, the serpentine moss flora of the present alpine region is dominated by arctic (or alpine) to subarctic (or subalpine) elements, although the total number of these species is very small. HATTORI (1957) pointed out the following facts about the serpentine hepatic flora of this mountain : (1) scarcity of the number and quantity of species, (2) poor representation of arctic or subarctic elements, (3) separated distribution of many temperate or subtropical hepatics, (4) occurrence of some species characteristic to the northern Japanese serpentine hepatic flora, (5) no occurrence of hepatics limited to the serpentine region, (6) close similarity between the serpentine floras of Mt. Hayachine and Mt. Apoi. Of these facts, 1,2,5 and 6 are recognized also in the moss flora of this mountain, but we cannot find any typical example of 3 and 4,so far as the moss flora is concerned. The range of Schistostega pennata in Japan has hitherto been considered to be limited to Hokkaido and Middle Honshu. In the study of distribution of bryophytes in Japan and the adjacent region, HORIKAWA (1955) mentioned that, "it is a strange fact that this plant has never been found in Northeast Honshu which is situated between Hokkaido and Middle Honshu." The present collection of this plant from the north foot (900m s.m., not composed of serpentine) of Mt. Hayachine fills the gap in the known distribution of it. Campylopus schimperi is apparently rare in Japan and has only recorded from the summit of the second highest mountain in our country, Mt. Kitadake (3100m s.m.), which is also composed of the Paleozoic rocks. The summit of Mt. Hayachine is the second station of the present species which was found in a small tuft only on rock crevices.

N2  - Lonicera konoi MAKINO can be distinguished from L. linderifolia MAXIM. only by the presence of smaller (1-3cm) and more sparsely pilose leaves. It is better to be considered as a variety of L. linderifolia. Being variable in the size and form of bract and bracteole, both Sanguisorba hakusanensis var. hakusanensis and var. coreana are apparently related to S. obtusa. Therefore, both varieties should be treated as varieties of S. obtusa.

N2  - Cacalia yatabei is a composite plant well known as a member of the Japanese flora. Although the occurrence of this species in the Rikuchu province was reported by TOBA in 1902,no specimen collected in the province was preserved in any main herbaria in Japan. On the course of my field trip, the considerable growth of this species was observed on Mt. Goyo as well as at the Osaki Peninsula. Having these new materials at hands, the phytogeography of C. yatabei is summarized in this paper and the taxonomica1 relationship between the species and its allied is also discussed. Cacalia yatabei MATSUM. et KOIDZ. in Bot. Mag. Tokyo 24 : 152 (1910) Type : HONSHU, Pref. Tochigi : Utanohama, Nikko, J. Matsumura s.n. (TI); KITAM. in Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 7 : 250 (1938), Comp. Jap. III : 223 (1942); HARA Enum. Sperm. Jap. II : 152 (1952); OHWI FI. Jap. Eng. ed. 885 (1965). In C. yatabei, NAKAI recognized two types concerning the number of florets and involucral scales per head; one with 5 florets and 5-(6) involucral scales per head and another with 3 florets and 3-(4) involucral scales per head. Considering these types and some other characters, NAKAI subdivided C. yatabei into two micro-species. The differences pointed out by NAKAI, however, seem to have no taxo-nomic significance at the species level. In addition, there are some intermediate forms between the two types. These two types, therefore, are better considered as infraspecific variations as treated by KITAMURA. Var. yatabei Miricacalia yatabei (MATSUM. et KOIDZ.) NAKAI in Jour. Jap. Bot. 14 : 641(1938) Five florets and 5-(6) involucral scales per head. Var. occidentalis F. MAEKAWA ex KITAM. in Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 7 : 250(1938), Comp. Jap. III : 224 (1942); HARA Enum. Sperm. Jap. II : 152 (1952); OHWI Fl. Jap. Eng. ed 885 (1965) -Miricacalia maekawae NAKAI 1.c. 642 Type : HONSHU, Pref. Nara : Mt. Ohdaigaharayama, S. Sakaguchi s. n. (TI). Three florets and 3-(4) involucral scales per head. As shown in Fig. 1,this species occurs mainly along the Pacific coast of Japan. The northern limit of the distribution coincides well with the border of the deepest (more than 50cm) snowfall region. The dispersal of the plant seems to be related, at least partly, to thawing. Similar distribution pattern is known in some other Japanese plants (e.g., Veronica Miqueliana, etc.). In his revision of the Japanese composite plants, KITAMURA proposed Sect. Taimingasa including the following species : C. amagiensis, C. peltifolia, C. yatabei, C. firma and C. pseudotaimingasa. Among these species, C. peltifolia is fairly unique by its peculiar peltate leaves and its cellular construction of leaf hairs (Fig. 3-F). Cacalia amagiensis, C. firma and C. pseudotaimingasa are taxonomically related to C. yatabei. These four species have leaves with triple-ribbed venation, but the leaf margin is considerably different in serration one another. In C. firma the leaves are slightly lobed, while in C. yatabei they are deeply lobed. The leaves of C. pseudotaimingasa are intermediate between the two. Leaves of C. amagiensis are almost entire, but are more or less lobed in some specimens. Geographically, both C. firma and C. pseudo-taimingasa occur in Korea (Fig. 2); C. amagiensis is found only from Izu Peninsula; C. yatabei is widely distributed in Japan but limited south of the Kitakami Mountains. Considering this distribution, it can be assumed that the ancestor of C. yatabei may had come from Korea Peninsula across Tsushima Strait and spreads northeastwards along the Pacific side of the Japanese Islands up to the Kitakami Mountains.

N2  - Three hundred specimens of small mammals, belonging to 10 species, were collected in Mt. Goyo (about 15km west of Kamaishi City, Iwate Pref.) and Mt. Hayachine (about 40km southeast of Morioka City, Iwate Pref.) during a short trip in the early summer of 1967. The most interesting mammals among them was Euroscaptor mizura mizura (GUNTHER, 1880) which was collected at the upper part of Tatamiishi (1100m alt.), Mt. Goyo. The subspecies is a rare animal in Japan and the specimen obtained here is the 8th record from the country, and, at the same time, new to the Tohoku district, Honshu. One of the most difficult problems of taxonomy among the Japanese small mammals is the status of Aschizomys andersoni (THOMAS, 1905) from northern Honshu. Twenty-one specimens of this species were collected during the trip to Mt. Goyo and Mt. Hayachine, and studied statistically by a simplified method employing the association coefficient in numerical taxonomy. The dendrogram (Fig. 1) made by the method clearly expresses the similarity of the Goyo-Hayachine populations to the population from Mt. Zao and, onthe other hand, the distinction between them and the other populations of central Honshu. These morphological relationships and the differentiation of the vertical distribution recognized among groups of Aschizomys in Honshu indicate the specific distinction of Aschizomys andersoni, which is represented by the populations of Mt. Goyo, Mt. Hayachine or Mt. Zao, from A. niigatae of central Honshu. The small mammal fauna of Mt. Goyo is peculiar among those of mountains of the Tohoku district in having the combination of Euroscaptor mizura mizura and Aschizomys andersoni, while that of Mt. Hayachine seems to be similar to the latter, although it could not be fully clarified by the present survey.

N2  - Three species of bats were collected in Mt. Goyo and Mt. Hayachine in Iwate Prefecture during the 1967 survey by our Museum. They are Myocis ef. M. hosonoi IMAIZUMI, 1954,Barbastella leucomelas darjelingensis (HODGSON, 1855), both collected from the Akasaka Pass of Mt. Goyo (alt. 700m) in the evening of June 22,and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum mikadoi OGNEV, 1927,from a cave in Mt. Kami-Iwa (alt. 791m) about 3.6km southwest of Hayachine Shrine, Dake, Ohazama-machi, collected on the 30th of June. The Myotis specimen from Mt. Goyo resembles typical M. hosonoi and also but in less extent Myotis mystacinus KUHL, 1819. The Mt. Goyo specimen possesses a peculiar tragus similar to that of M. mystacinus, being widest near the base and convex at the posterior border, but is similar also to that of M. hosonoi in having the concave anterior border. The same specimen, however, has more whitish ventral fur in comparison with the latter two. The length ratio of facial portion to braincase of skull is 93.10%, which is not within the range of M+3 S.D. of M. hosonoi, and the breadth of braincase is evidently larger than that of M. hosonoi. Therefore, this specimen may represent a distinct but hitherto unknown subspecies of M. hosonoi. Barbastella leucomelas darjelingensis. a very rare subspecies, was caught in Mt. Goyo as the seventh record of its occurrence in Japan. Specimens identified as Rhinolophus ferrumequinum mikadoi were collected in Mt. Kami-Iwa. In the color of the upper part of body, however, the Mt. Kami-Iwa materials are slightly but clearly different from the typical subspecies. Their forearm length is evidently longer than that of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon TEMMINCK, 1835.

N2  - A line transect census of birds of Mt. Hayachine was made between June 30th and July 4th, 1967. The north side slope along 8km from Kadoma Village, 600m in altitude, to the alpine rocky top of 1913m is extensively forested with the altitudinal changes of vegetations and bird species. the abrup cliffy south side lacks upper forest zone, but the foot zone forest, different from the north side, spreads down to Dake Village, 500m in altitude, where deforested part was also a distinct bird habitat. Bird species and their distribution were described, comparing those of the north and the south sides in relation to the forest types. A total of 53 species were reported. From the oak forest zone, 500-750m in altitude, 27 species were recorded, represented by Garrulus glandarius, Emberiza cioides, Parus major, Aegithalos caudatus, Turdus cardis, Caprimulgus indicus, Cuculus poliocephalus, etc; from the middle zones (mixed deciduous on the north and beech forest on the south sides), 750-1000m, 23 species, represented by Sitta europaea, Parus montanus, Phylloscopus tenellipes, Erithacus cyane, Dendrocopos major, D. kizuki, Muscicapa cyanomelana and T. troglodyles, the last two being especially plentiful along the valley of the north side; from the upper coniferous zone, 1000-1300m, 24 species, represented by Parus ater, Erithacus akahige, E. cyanurus and also T. troglodytes; Nucifraga caryocatactes, E. cyanurus and Phylloscopus borealis were dominant in the subalpine dwarf forest above 1300m; this forest graded to the Pinus pumila zone, where Prunella rubida was common and P. pyrrhula and others were recorded. The rocky summit was occupied by territories of Anthus hodgsoni. Cettia diphone was not common, though it ranged through up to the dwarf forest. This is the first printed report on the birds of Mt. Hayachine, and details will be published elsewhere. A wren collected here is distinctly darker than usual Honshu specimens.

N2  - Faunistic study was made on the fresh water fishes in the streams flowing through the mountainous land of the Rikuchu district to the Pacific Ocean four times from early August to the end of October, 1967; the water systems studied here are R. Kuji, R. Akka, R. Omoto, and R. Hei; the localities of these rivers are given in a map attached to the introduction of the present Memoir. The collected specimens contain 19 species, 17 of which are supposed to be endemic. Characteristic features of the fish fauna of the district are as follows : (1) Poorness of the ture fresh water fish is noteworthy, and its comparison with other faunas in waters surrounding Rikuchu land may give a clue to the origin of the fauna. (2) All representatives of the genus Cottus in northern Japan, such as C. hilgendorfi STEINDACIINER et DODERLEIN, C. hangiongensis MORI and C. pollux GUNTHER, were collected at least in R. Omoto. This is merely a preliminary study of the fresh water fishes of this district, but the present collection seems to cover about 70% of the whole species which is expected in the district.

N2  - This paper contains records and notes of some remarkable species of beetles collected at Mt. Hayachine in the Kitakami Mountain Range and in Miyako City on the eastern coast of the Rikuchu district. Brief descriptions of a few new forms are also included. (Carabidae) 1. Calosoma inquisitor cyanescens MOTSCHULSKY Miyako 2. Carabus (Limnocarabus) clathratus maacki MORAWITZ Miyako 3. Carabus (Asthenocarabus) opaculus shirahatai NAKANE Mt. Hayachine (Harpalidae) 4. Trechiama oreas (BATES) Mt. Hayachine 5. Pacrobus (Apatrobus) hayachinensis NAKANE, sp. nov. Holotype : ♂, Mt. Hayachine, Iwate Pref., N.E. Honshu, Japan, 7. VIII, 1964 (M. NAKAYA). Body length : 8mm. Black or blackish brown species, with reddish appendages and underside of hind body. Closely related to P. (A.) echigonus HABU et BABA from Niigata Prefecture, but differs from the latter in having the following features : microsculpture of elytra isodiametric and distinctly impressed; apex of median lobe of the male genitalia markedly bent downwards; 3rd interval of elytra bearing 3 pores adjoining to the 3rd stria, and marginal pores 7 or 8 in number; and temporae of head oblique and very slightly tumid. 6. Plerostichus (Bothriopterus) thunbergi michinoku NAKANE, susp. nov. Holotype : ♂, Kadoma, Mt. Hayachine, Iwate Pref., N.E. Honshu, Japan, 6. VII. 1967,T. NAKANE leg. Body length : 11mm. At a glance the present subspecies resembles P. subovatus MOTSCHULSKY or P. yoritomus BATES in size and shape, but its upper surface has no metallic lustre and its pronotum lacks in the longitudinal fold just inside the hind angles. As compared with the typical specimens of P. thunbergi, this race is relatively smaller and less robust, and different in having the distinctly cordate prothorax and the more voal-shaped elytra with more sloped shoulders. Hind angles of pronotum are distinctly angulate. 7. Cymindis (Tarulus) subarcticus KANO Mt. Hayachine The pronotum of our single example (♀) has sharply projected hind angles as in the nominate race. (Ptilodactylidae) 8. Epilichas flabellatus (KIESENWETTER) Miyako The specimens obtained are coloured as the typical form, but relatively smaller and their abdomen is blackish. 9. Epilichas brunneicornis usori NAKANE Mt. Hayachine (Lycidae) 10. Lyponia delicatula (KIESENWETTER) Miyako 11. Cautires nakanei (J. WINKLER) Miyako This species is characterized by having long and slender median lobe of the male genitalia. C. geometricus (KIESENWETTER) and C. incompositus (OHBAYASHI) also occur in Miyako. (Nitidulidae) 12. Meligethes praetermissus EASTON Mt. Hayachine This is the first record from Honshu. (Cryptophagidae) 13. Serratomaria tarsalis NAKANE et HISAMATSU Mt. Hayachine (Alleculidae) 14.

Hayachine A melanistic example (♀) was obtained at Mt. Hayachine (Type, Kadoma, 5. VII. 1967,T. NAKANE leg.). The antennae and legs as well as the body black, with the exception of labrum, maxilla, labium, tibial spurs and claws reddish brown : ab. iwatensis NAKANE nov. (Chrysomelidae) 17. Basilepta balyi yezo NAKANE Mt. Hayachine One of the examples collected is black, as ab. japonicum JACOBY. (Anthribidae) 18.

N2  - Sixty-four species of the Odonata can be enumerated from the area of Rikuchu (Iwate Prefecture) based upon literature and the surveys made in 1965 and 1967. The following four species are of considerable interest from the view point of geographical distribution. 1. Ischnura senegalensis (RAMBUR) Found at a seaside pond, Founakoshi-numa, as the northernmost site of distribution for this wide ranging palaeotropical species. 2. Aeschna mixta (LATREILLE) This Eurosiberian species has been known to be extremely rare in Japan, but it was now supposed to be not scarce in Rikuchu. 3. Somatochlora graeseri aureola OGUMA The Siberian S. graeseri is represented in Hokkaido as a race, aureola, and has been found very sporadically in North Honshu; one locality is Samurai-hama in Rikuchu. 4. Sympetrum striolatum imitoides BARTENEF This Manchurian race is supposed to have invaded the Japanese Islands via Korea on one side and via Sachalin on the other. We now found the southernmost site of the northern route in Rikuchu (Todogasaki and Funakoshi-numa.)

N2  - The present work was carried out in the daytime of the 6th and 7th of July, 1967,to study the plankton fauna and flora in Miyako and Yamada bays on the eastern coast of Tohoku district. The writers examined the whole settled volume of plankton, and the total specimen-number and the composition of zooplankton at every station, and then discussed the relationship between their distributions and the topographic or hydrographic features of the bays. While the inner region of Miyako Bay is predominated by the inshore forms of Protozoa, Medusa, Dinoflagellata, Tintinnoidea, Copepoda, Cladocera, Tunicata and larval forms of other organisms, the neritic and oceanic forms are distributed in a considerable number, in addition to the inshore forms, in the inner inlet of Yamada Bay. The directions of the inflow of the open sea water are deduced from the qualitative distributional pattern of the open sea forms.

N2  - Miyako Bay is one of the representative notches developed along the rias coast of "Sanriku", the Pactific coast of Northeast Japan. Its bottom rises up from the depth about 70m at the mouth rapidly to the exit of the Port of Miyako, and then gently to the innermost corner of the bay. Distribution of the depth gradients is concordant with the shape of an acute-angled triangle, excluding the west coast south of the mouth of the Hei-gawa, where the bottom is relatively shallow probably due to the exceptional accumulation of sand. The inner part of the bay is almost occupied with muddy material, while the mouth region has sandy bottom. On the other hand, Yamada Bay possesses a rather extraordinal shape among many bays along the "Sanriku" coast; it develops as a nearly circular inlet in the interior of a triangle-shaped bay beyond a narrow canal of ca. 1km width and of ca. 50m depth. The depth gradients spread out in fan shape from this deepest area of the canal toward the inside, except for the zone surrounding two islets located a little west of the center of the inlet. The major part of Yamada Bay is also occupied with muddy sediments but the sandy material develops well along almost all coasts. The outside from the canal is buried with sandy sediments similarly to the case of Miyako Bay. The above-mentioned outlines were made by compiling the data obtained from the charts (Sheet Nos. 1094 and 54 of the Hydrographic Office; summarized in Figs. 2 and 3), and those from the new observations undertaken there. The sediment samples, 24 in total number, were taken from July 5 to 9,1967,using the PHLEGER gravity core sampler which could catch the cores of ca. 3cm diameter and of maximum length of 40cm. Every top 1cm of these cores was analyzed by the EMERY Tube Method for the sandy fraction and, at the same time, by the Pippette Method for the muddy one. The results are summarized in Table 1 and Figs. 4 and 5. Md_φ (median size of grains) of every sample, except Nos. 503 and 601,indicates very fine grained sand to silt size and no tendency of geographical differentiation. On the contrary, skewness (aφ) suggests a rough dividing of sediments of Miyako Bay into two types, the inner part and the outer one, boundary of which appears to coincide with the change in depth decreasing. The sediments of the inner part has greater value of skewness, in other words, greater amount of the coarser grains than those of the outer one, despite that their values of median size are similar to one another. It may have been expected before that the skewness of nearly every sample from Yamada Bay falls in the same category as the inner part of Miyako Bay. Besides, sorting coefficients (σφ) observed in Yamada Bay seem to be slightly greater than those of Miyako Bay as a whole; namely, the muddy sediments of the former were slightly less sorted. This tendency is also expectable because Yamada Bay has a more closed shape.

N2  - In July, 1967,17 core samples of the Recent sediments were collected by the PHLEGER gravity coreer from Miyako Bay. Every top 1cm of these cores was prepared for the faunal analysis of living Foraminifera, through the fixation on board by the buffered formalin and the staining by the rose bengal. Thanatocoenoses from the same materials were also analyzed by several quantitative methods. The data and results, however, are so numerous to be given in this Memoir that their details will be published in English on other occasion, probably in Bull. Nat. Sci. Mus., vol. 11.

N2  - The survey of Miyako Bay, Iwate Prefecture, was made in July, 1967,to provide data on benthonic communities. Eighteen stations were selected in this area (see Fig. 1). The bottom samples obtained by dredging were washed through by sieves of 5mm and 1mm standard mesh and animals contained in them were divided into several groups. The polychaetes were examined and classified into 41 species and 7 indeterminable ones. Table 1 shows their occurrences at the stations. About one half of the species dealt with here were found in each of Stations 5,13,14,15 and 16. Ninoe palmata MOORE, 1903,recorded first in Sendai Bay, is distributed widely in the Bay. The PARAONIDAE are first recorded in the Japanese waters; their detailed account will be published later.

N2  - It is well known that the marine molluscan fauna of Japan is composed of two elements, namely the warm Kuroshio current type and the cold Oyashio current type. On the Pacific coast, the northern limit of the warm current elements is around Cape Erimo, Hokkaido (42°N), while the southern limit of the cold current ones is around Choshi, Honshu (35°N). Therefore, the two faunal types overlap in the area from Cape Erimo to Choshi, forming the transitional temperature region between the subtropical and subboreal ones. As the Rikuchu coast is situated just in the transitional temperature area, the molluscan fauna occurring there has features of both warm Kuroshio and cold Oyashio current elements. The total number of molluscan species found on this coast is 259,of which 170 species are common to the southern part of Japan, and 89 species are characteristic of the cold current fauna, that is distributed in Hokkaido and further north. During the course of this survey, 16 species listed above are newly recorded from this area.
