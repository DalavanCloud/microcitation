N2  - The result of survey conducted during the period from July to October 1956 on the composition and seasonal succession of a community of adult mosquitoes resting in the daytime in the grass of Chikugo River-bed at Mamezu, Saga Prefecture is given in the present paper. The method for sampling was to sweep the grass by a net for five minutes and the number of mosquitoes collected in the net was counted. During the period of survey, only five species of mosquitoes, Anopheles sinensis Wiedmann, Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles, Culex pipiens Linnaeus, Culex vishnui Theobald and Culex bitaeniorhynchus Giles were recognized in the grass of the river-bed. The seasonal succession of the mosquito community resting in the daytime is given in Fig.2. In the community A. sinensis occupied of majority of the species, C. tritaeniorhynchus was the next abundant species, and the other species were found in far lesser numbers. Seasonal changes of A. sinensis and C. tritaeniorhynchus are given in Fig.4. Apparently C. tritaenicrhynchus was the dominant species during July in the community, whereas A. sinensis was most prevalent in later period. Although the total number of C. tritaeniorhynchus far exceeded that of A. sinensis in this area, A. sinensis was found in largest numbers in the grass. This indicates that the grass provided the best resting habitat in the daytime for A. sinensis. An analysis of a population of A. sinensis in such a habitat showed that females are more prevalent individuals than males and engorged females are more numerous than unfed ones.

N2  - Two species of mosquitoes, Anopheles sinensis Wiedemann and Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles, are the main species attracted to the mammalian domestic animals in Japan. The diurnal resting habit of these mosquitoes has hitherto been unknown. In this paper, the results of the author's comparative studies on the density of the resting populations of these mosquitoes in the stables and bushes were reported. Between the stables and bushes there is a bank of Chikugo River. The results were summarized in Fig.2 and Table 1. Anopheles sinensis was found in largest numbers in the bushes than the stables, and the reverse was true in the case of Culex tritaeniorhynchus. These facts may indicate that Anopheles sinensis is an outdoor-resting species and Culex tritaeniorhynchus is an indoor-resting species. Anopheles sinensis is the important vector of propagating Setaria spp. in Japan. The temperature and humidity in the bush was higher than those in the stable. Therefore, the bush seems to have a close connection for the epidemics of the filariasis of domestic animals, because the period of development of the larvae of Setaria spp. in the body of mosquuito is short under the conditions of high temperature and humidity. Number of resting individuals in the population of Anopheles sinensis in the bush was changed wtih the distance from the blood-sucking place of this mosquito. At Point 4 where the distance recorded from the blood-sucking place was 400m, this mosquito was found very few in number, and the engorged female could not be taken at Point 3 where the distance recorded from the blood-sucking place was 300m. Therefore the effective flight range of this mosquito must be very narrow. The number of males recorded in the survey was 8 at Point 0, 18 at Point 1, 12 at Point 2, 11 at Point 3, 1 at Psint 4 and 7 at Point 5. According to the number of males and females collected in this survey, the copulation of this mosquito seems to occur within the limits of 100-300m from the blood-sucking place in this area where the breeding place is not far off.

N2  - Recently, several workers have reported on the seasonal occurrence of Culicoides collected by light traps in Japan. Shogaki in 1953 reported "On the seasonal succession of biting midges caught by light trap in Kyoto and the frequency of wing spot variations on Culicoides arakawae (Arakawa)." In 1956 Ueno and others studied the species and seasonal incidence of Culicoides in the Tokyo area from the view point of veterinary medicine. Nagahana and Toyama reported the species and seasonal prevalence of biting midges caught by light trap in Yonago city, Tottori Prefecture, and western Honshu in 1956. Takahashi and others have recently published notes on Culicoides (Diptera : Ceratopogonidae) in Niigata Prefecture, Japan.

N2  - During the course of bionomic studies being conducted on mosquitoes by members of the staff of the Department of Entomology, 406th Medical General Laboratory, a new species of Culicoides was collected from three localities in central Honshu, Japan and one locality in South Korea. This report includes a description of the adults of the new gnat and brief notes on its biology. Morphological interpretations are basically those of Wirth (1952). Measurement of length is the combined length of thorax and abdomen. The costal ratio is the combined length of thorax and abdomen. The costal ratio is obtained by dividing the costal length (from the arculus to the distal edge of the second radial cell) by the wing length (from the arculus to the wing tip). Measurements were made on paratype specimens mounted in either balsam or synthetic resin.

N2  - Clinical observations were made on the bite of horsefly larvae which was seen on hands and feet of farmers working in the paddy-fields mainly in the period from the time of rice-planting to weeding, usually from May to July and biology of the larvae was also studied. Their bites were almost found at the exposed extremities sticking in the mud. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) In all of twenty cases observed in the paddyfield there occurred momentary sharp pain left with small puncture wound at the site of bite, being accompanied with raised hyperemic swelling which was intensely itching. Some of them had to be given medical treatment. 2) Predisposing sites of the lesion were ankle region, fingers, legs and dorsum of the hand, in that order. 3) Hypoesthesia was revealed in the area distal to the wound corresponding to a certain nerve supply in six cases in which sites of bite were lateral surface of fingers or ankle region. 4) Experimental bites using the larvae carried out in six volunteers led the same symptoms produced by natural bites. 5) The poison-pouring mechanism by the bite of the larvae was believed as follow. Puncturing of the skin by mandibles with sawtoothed margins, function as a pair of scissors in snipping the skin, produces a wound through which the saliva is introduced. 6) Differential diagnosis of this entity from other dermatitis caused by the work in paddy-field is easy in typical cases in which sharp pain at the moment of bite followed by the irritating local pruritus is characteristic. 7) Eight species of Tabanidae (six of Tabanus and two of Chrysops) were obtained by individually rearing of the horsefly larvae collected in paddyfields where the bite occured frequently. 8) The larvae were more numerous in the mud of "Nawashiro" (beds for rice-plants) than "Honden" (common paddy-fields) and many moulting pelts of pupae were found in ridges between fields. 9) It was very interesting that many overwintering larvae were left exposed on the mud of paddy-fields just after snow-break in spring.

N2  - 1) During a survey from March, 1955, to November, 1956, five Rattus rattus, eleven R. norvegicus and twenty-six Suncus caeruleus were captured in the Shiroyama area, Kagoshima-city. These animals harboured, in total, sixty-two chiggers, referable to Doloisia okabei. There were also examined another seventy-five S. caeruleus and two pigeons (Columba livia domestica) taken in August and November from Yoron Island, North Ryukyu Islands, and a total of ten D. okabei were found upon them. 2) Doloisia okabei was recognized to appear in a season from March to October, showing a peak of prevalence in July. There were statistically significant difference in the chaetotaxy between the Kagoshima specimens and Yoron Island specimens. The measurements of AW, PW, pl, and s showed significant difference (significance level α=0.1%) and SB and dsa showed significant difference (1.0% level). The numbers of total setae, second-row setae and third-row setae also showed significant difference (2.0% level).

N2  - Experimental infection with tsutsugamushi disease were carried out using albino rats in the noxious area in Niigata Prefecture. Cages containing experimental rats were exposed in the area about 20 hours in each time and these experiments were done from April to October in 1958. Positive results were obtained in a group of 9 rats in August. Two species, 15 individuals of Trombicula i. e. one of T. akamushi and 14 of T. pallida, exclusive of 1 damaged unknown species were found on the rats infected with tsutsugamushi disease.

N2  - Monthly collections of tsutsugamushi (trombiculid mites) were made for the period of one year at two different localities in Hiroshima Prefecture, Aga and Watarikawa. At Aga, a total of 12 species of trombiculid mites were recovered from a single species of hosts, Apodemus speciosus. Seasonal occurrences of these species were more or less Autumn-spring type as the rule, but the period and the total number differed by the species. Trombicula kitasatoi, T. fuji, T. daisen and Gahrliepia saduski were the predominant species and coverd almost all through the year except for the summer season. At Watarikawa where the general fauna was richer and three species of mammal hosts could be collected by the same trapping system, the species of trombiculid mites recovered were only 8 (from Apodemus, only 6), and their seasonal distribution periods were shorter in general, thus showing remarkable differences by the localities. Specific characters in the seasonal distributions of each species compared with data obtained at north Honshu or at Kyushu were also discussed.

N2  - Observations were made on the structure of the experimental population of brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) which had been established in an enclosure. Besides natural populations of brown rats living in an laboratory animal shed were surveyed on their structures, and population dynamics. Experimentally established population of rats has been maintained in an outdoor enclosure of about 1.8×3.6 sq. meter floor space, providing four nest boxed and nesting materials with sufficient daily food materials. This population was originated by introducing one male and several females. Results of daily observations for a long period indicate that the population in such a closed condition could only be composed of a single dominant male and several females, including youngs bred from these adults. No competiens were observed among the dominant male adult and other males of its desendant, while the dominant male attacked the males which were introduced into the colony from other populations. The population of brown rats in a natural environment was observed in a laboratory animal shed. The results of analysis on the amount of consumption of food experimentally distributed at various localities of the shed showed that the population was composed of at least 2 colonies of rats, settled at each side of the building. Mark and release test and observations on scattering of dyed feces after feeding rats with stained food materials were carried out in several occasions during the course of the survey, in order to obtain informations about home ranges of each individuals. Findings indicated that one colony had continued to develop, increasing its size of population and at last suppressed another colony to only a small range of territory at the other end of the building. After an experiment of poisoning with poisonous baits distributed in one half of the shed where the smaller colony maintained its territory, smaller colony was observed to diminish completely. No particularly dominant males could be detected at both colonies. Each colony involved several adult males, however, no remakable copetitions among these males of the same colony were observed, while the fact that preadult and adult males were captured more frequently on the intercolonical border seemed to suggest there might be competitions among males of different colonies, resulting in the movement of the location of border.

N2  - In Japan, many insecticidal formulations are distributed in the market, each of which contains two or more active ingredients. This seems to depend on the reason why a insecticidal mixture has many advantages, i. e. a wide usage to various insect pests, rapidity in the effect, longer residual effect and the expected synergistic action between the component insecticides. While, regarding these problems, especially the synegistic action, few academic reports have been presented in Japan. So, the anthor took up the theme, the synergistic action between a chlorinated-and organic phosphorus insecticides, adopting dieldrin as a former, and DDVP and diazinon as the latter. Experiments were done by the topical application method dropping aceton solutions of insecticides on the dorsal thorax of 3〜5 days old female house flies, Musca vicina Macquart. The date were discussed using the Bliss' formula of independent joint action : p=p_1+p_2 (1-p_1)(1-r) 0<r<1 in the above formula p, p_1, and p_2 shows the mortality of combined chemical, that of one component chemical and that of the other component chmical, respectively, and r shows the correlation coefficient of the susceptibility of the insects to insecticides. The following two conclusions were obtained : 1) The mortality of the formulation which contains 20 parts of dieldrin and 1 part of DDVP was 1.49 times higher than that calculated from the regression equtions of each component chemical : and in the case of the combination of 5 parts of dieldrin to 1 part of DDVP, the mortlity was 1.13 times higher than the calculated value. 2) Diazinon was activated by under-lethal dose of dieldrin and the combination was 1.37 times more effective than the calculated value.

N2  - The effect of six insecticides on German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., was compared by exposing the insects to the residues for 0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 20 minutes. Half cc of WHO DDT (30%), dieldrin (5%), chlordane (5%), lindane (5%), malathion (5%) and diazinon (5%) was applied to a veneer plate of 10cm×10cm. After drying the plates for 1 day, roaches were exposed to them. After exposing for the limitted minutes, the roaches were transfered to clear pots. The knockdown percentage and the mortality were recorded thereafter. The results were as follow : 1) The longer the exposure time was, the higher the knckdown percentage after six days was, except in the case of DDT to female and male roaches and of malathion to male ones. To gain knockdown of 90%, the following exposure time was necessary; in dieldrin, chlordane and diazinon 4-6 minutes to female, 0.5-2 minutes to male; in lindane over 40 minutes to female, 6.3 minutes to male; and in malathion 18 minutes to male. 2) The rapidity of knockdown of the roaches after being exposed to the residues was degraded in the following order : lindane>diazinon, malathion≫chlordane>dieldrin>DDT. Some of the roaches exposed to the residues of lindane, diazinon or malathion were knocked down after 1 to 4 hours, but increase of knockdown percentage from 1 day to 6 days after the exposure was only little by little. On the contrary in the cases of dieldrin and chlordane, few roaches were knocked down within 4 hours, but thereafter the percentage increased remarkable. The action of DDT was slower and the effect was far less than the other chemicals tested. Some of the roaches exposed to lindane residue recovered after knockdown. Such result was remarkable in male roaches and in the case of shorter time of exposure. 3) Male roaches were more susceptible than female ones to all the chemicals tested except malathion to which female was slightly more susceptible. 4) In practical control program of German cockroach by painting the insecticides narrowly on the surface on which roaches would often crawl, dieldrin, chlordane and diazinon were admitted to be suitable and effective.

N2  - In 1957, a test on the control of German cockroaches, Blattella germanica L. was carried out in a hospital in Tokyo to evaluate the effectiveness of diazinon, treating the chemical narrowly around the shelters of roaches. The effect was determined by counting the number of cockroaches in four shelters. The population of the roaches was reduced to half of that of pretreatment in a few days and excellent control was obtained a month after the treatment.

N2  - In this paper, the observations of the ecology of a Limantrid moth, the Far Eastern urticating moth, Euproctis flava Bremer, made throughout the life cycle in laboratory and in field are reported. Overwintering in larval stage, this species has a generation in a year (Table 1). The mean duration of each life stage is shown in Table 2. Pupa, adult and egg are found during summer season, as these stages are rather short, the larvae can be seen almost throughout the year. The female moth usually deposits her eggs in a single mass, preferably on the under surface of a leaf. An egg-mass is covered with the hairs of her anal tuft. Each mass contains 200-1, 000 eggs. A female moth can oviposits 1-3 times during her life, therefore 300-1, 500 eggs are produced by a single female. As shown in Table 3, the hatching ratio are favoured in a higher humidity. After hatching, the young larvae gather to a tight colony, until as late as the late autumn, but after hibernation, they tend to scatter to all parts of the trees and the surroundings, entering into a solitary life. The number of larval moultings varies between eleven to seventeen. The number of instars may be influenced by various environmental factors such as : local distributional factor (probably due to the temperature), seasonal disparity of the oviposition time, suitability of the food plant, and the larval population density; further by the difference of sex and the presence of parasitic natural enemies. The period of each instar duration is shown in Table 4. The larvae on an stage of between 9-13 instars hibernate within a winternest, which is spun on the ground or among dead leaves. The records of the entering to and the awakening from hibernation are shown in Tables 5, 6, and 7 and Figs.2 and 3. A mature larva leaves the food plant to seek the pupating site, where they spin a rather loose cocoon and pupate therein. The moth usually emerges out from pupal skin between the hours of 13 : 00 to 16 : 00 in the afternoon, male moths emerge 5-6 days earlier than the females do. The adult insects take no food. The mating takes place in the night-times immediately after emergence, and about 3 days after the mating, the female begins to deposit eggs. The list of food plants, including previous author's records, is shown in Table 8. But, younger instar larvae show tendency of preference to several plants, for example, Quercus spp., Rhododendron spp., Rosa spp., Polygonum spp. and etc. When breeding parallel crowded cultures on different food-plant, marked differences were observed in the rates of larval development and the larval body colour. The result obtained with four different food plants : Quercus serrata, Rhododendron linearifolium, Prunus yedoensis var. macrosepalum and Celtis sinensis var. japonica, for 100 larvae crowded cultures, are given in Fig.7 and Table 9. The results clearly showed that the food-plant can affect the development and colour composition of larva. Larvae reached maturity on Prunus fewer one instar than Quercus and Rhododendron. Larvae bred on Celtis died all until 10th instar. In order to analyse the variability of larval colour pattern, four colour groups were divided, based on the extent of the dorsal black markings on the third to the seventh abdominal segments (Fig. 6). The result shows that the colour composition and the mean colour are affected by the foodplant; Quercus resulting in the darkest with a group mean of 1.78, whilst Prunus produced the lightest with a mean of 2.38. Some effects of population number in association were determined by the comparing of different cultures under solitary to crowded conditions. Larvae of cultures bred less than 10 larvae in association, died all before 8th instar, the culture of 20 larvae reached maturity in 15th instar, whilst that of 50 and 100 larvae in 16th instar. As regards to the variation of colour pattern, the culture of 100 larvae became the darkest with a group mean of 2.33, whilst that of 20 larvae became the lightest with a mean of 2.94. The effects of population density after the hibernation upon the development were as follows. In the female, the number of moultings was always 5, while it is, in the male, 4 at lower densities and 5 at higher densities. The larvae of lower densities pupated earlier than that of the higher densities. The ratio of pupation and emergence was lower in higher densities. The irritating or poisonous property of this insect originates exclusively from the urticating spicules growing on the dorsal surface of the larva. The injuries of irritation are neverthless caused by the insects in any life stage. This is due to the fact that the urticating spicules can be transferred successively throughout the life cycle. Just after spinning of cocoon, the female larva attaches or smears her urticating spicules making a spicule belt inside the cocoon at the anterior one the third. The belt of a male is only ill defined (Fig 8). While, emerging out from the pupa, the female moth partly appearing from the cocoon turns round and round her abdominal end, rubbing the spicule belt inside the cocoon. The urticating spicules attached on her abdominal end, are finally used to cover the surface of the egg mass, mixed with the anal tuft hairs of the mother moth. Newly hatched larvae "collect" the urticating spicules from the covering of egg mass, they carry the spicules on the posterior segments of the abdomen Larvae of subsequent instar have their own urticating spicules on the dorsal surface abdominal segment, but during the first and the later moulting, newly moulted caterpillars attempt to pick up the old urticating spicules on his own spicules, bending their body back on the old skin.

N2  - In this paper, the author argues the epidemiological character of the Far Eastern urticating moth, Euproctis flava Bremer, and describes the mode of injury caused by the insect, based upon the cases reported in Tokyo. Of the ten species of Japanese Euproctis species examined, it was recognized that E. similis, xanthocampa, piperita, pulverea, kurosawai, pseudoconspersa, staudingeri hold the urticating spicules in the anal tuft, similarly as flava does. But, it has not been proved on E. torasan and curvata, of which each only a male adult specimen was examined. The two species, E. flava and pseudoconspersa, are believed to be considerable pest of medical importance, in this country. Occasionally, E. flava abnormally breaks out in a large area, while E. pseudoconspersa, frequently occurs locally on the yard of residences in the suburbs of larger cities. The cases of injury caused by E. flava in Tokyo, 1956-57, may be summarized as follows. The majority of victims was housewives and followed by the salaried men and students. The majority of the injure-cases took place indoors, between the hours 18 : 00 and 24 : 00. The dermatitis appeared oftener on arm, then neck and breast. The injuries caused by egg, larva and pupe were seldom.

N2  - 1. A series of investigations have been made on the bionomics and life history of the dermatitiscausing beetle, Xanthochroa waterhousei Harold, Collections and observations were made at various localities of Japan. 2. Adults of the present species is distinguished from those of allied species mainly by the structure of the apical part of abdomen. Larvae are characterized by possessing asperated ambullatory ampullae on the dorsum of three thoracic and first two abdominal segments as well as on the venter of 3rd and 4th abdominal segments, though in the first instar they are inconspicuous. Eyes of the last instar larvae absent, but 2 pairs of ocelli are discernible in the first instar. Eggs are subcylindrical, tapering towards both rounded tips, somewhat curved in whole shape, milky white in colour and 1.3 to 1.4mm in length. 3. The seasonal occurence of the adults varied by the localities, but was confined to early summer as the principle. In warmer parts of Japan such as in Kyushu, they could be collected from April to June; in Tokyo and in Kobe from May to July; in the mountains of Honshu as well as in Hokkaido where the climate is colder, they were found to be active until September. In other words, the seasonal distributions of the adult beetle and occurence of the dermatitis seem to be much influenced by the local climate, i. e. they appear earlier in season as climate gets warmer. 4. Diurnal activities of the adult beetle in nature was investigated. In the daytime, they usually stay still beneath leaves of trees. They become active towards evening and often fly around chestnut flowers in swarms. Through field observations, feeding experiments and dissections of the digestive organs, they were found to feed mainly on pollens of various kinds of flowers. 5. The results of light trap collections made repeatedly at Narimasu, Tokyo, showed that activities of the beetle were confined mainly in the first few hours of the darkening or of the premidnight type. 6. Secretions of the poisonous or dermatitiscausing fluid of the adult beetle (determined by the author and Watanabe as cantharidine) take place by compression on any part of the body. The fluid may be secreted from sublateral parts of the anterior and posterior margin of pronotum, longitudinal costae of elytra or the tip of each tarsus. 7. During copulation, a male stays on the back of a female in a parallel position. However, some of the females were often found to ride on other females and protrude their ovipositor, acting as if they were males in mating positions. 8. Females in cage insert their long ovipositor into narrow crevices and deposit eggs in a mass. Eggs are covered with a glutinous substance and are abhesive to each other. The numbers of eggs in a cluster varied from 56 to 221 in five times of observations. The incubation period was 7 to 14 days under the room temperature of 13.9℃ to 31.6℃. 9. Larvae in nature were found to burrow into rotten timbers of Sugi-tree (Japanese ceder) making holes just above or beneath the soil surface. In a laboratory breeding experiment, first instar larvae kept with the rotten timber emerged in May of the following year. The beetle seems to pass one generation in a year. 10. In the daytime collections in nature, the sex ratio of male to female was 43 to 57. In the light trap collections, males were much fewer than females only 2% of the total. Attractiveness towards the light source seem to be much stronger in the female.

N2  - Paederus fuscipes Curtis is the poisonous beetle which frequently causes an acute human dermatitis in Japan as well as in number of foreign countries. The author has made experimental and field observations on the life history, bionomics and distributions of the species in Japan. External structures of each developmental stage have also been fully described. The life cycle of this species comprises egg, larva (two instars), pupa and adult. Adults are about 7mm in length, and look like ants. Free pupae are about 4.5mm in length; body slender and curved ventrally, milky white to orange yellow in colour, with a pair of long seta-like processes on the anterior and posterior margins of pronotum, lateral margins of 1st, 3rd to 7th abdominal segments respectively. The second instar larvae are 4 to 6mm in length; body subcylindrical, white to orange yellow in colour, with a pair of urogomphi. The first instar larvae are 2.2 to 3.4mm in length. Eggs are subspherical, 0.6 to 0.7mm in diameter immediately after the oviposition, but increase in size as the development proceeds. The species is widely distributed throughout Japan, from Hokkaido to Kyushu. It seems to be more abundant in warmer regions. The adults are usually found on soil surface or on grasses in dump places, such as marsh or rice-field. At Narimasu, Tokyo, they could be collected by a light trap during the season from the end of April to the end of October, having the peak in June and July. The nocturnal activity of the adults belongs to the pre-midnight type, i. e. more than half of the total number of a night collection by the light trap was obtained within two and half hours after it had become dark. Eggs are usually laid singly into the crevices on the soil surface. The numbers of eggs deposited by a female were from 18 to 100 with the mean of 52.3. Females which overwintered began to lay eggs from the end of April or from the middle of May to July. Those which emerged in early June continued to lay eggs from July to September. Incubation period of eggs were 3 to 19 days. Hatching rate observed was 96.2%. Larval stage consists of only two instars, the duration being 4 to 22 days for the first instar and 7 to 36 days for the second. Pupation takes place in a chamber constructed beneath the soil surface. Pupae are held up off the wet floor of the chamber by seta-like processes on the pronotum and abdominal segments. Pupal stage was 3 to 12 days. The total development from egg to adult required 22 to 50 days, with an average of 32.5 days. Adults are polyphagous in their food habits, feed mainly on insects, mites and soil nematodes, but also on dacayed vegetables in nature. The food habits of larvae are similar to the adults, mainly carnivorous as a rule, but could experimentally be reared with either beef or cucumber. Adults are eaten by frogs and parasitized by a namatode, a mite (hypopus stage) and Laboulbenia cristata. Eggs and larvae are attacked by various kinds of predacious insects and spiders. The annual life cycle was rather irregular around Tokyo, either one, two or three generations in a year. The adults were the only stage which could be recovered during hibernation. They often form clusters during the overwintering period. The poisonous substance which causes dermatitis could be detected in every part of the body of adults, pupae, larvae and eggs. It is contained in the body fluid, and leaks out only when a part of the body is injured. Among eight species of the genus Paederus found from Japan, four species, i. e. fuscipes, tamulus, poweri and parallelus were found to contain the poisonous substance, but fuscipes seemed to be the only species of practical importance. Out of 68 species of Staphylinidae collected by light traps in Japan, Paederus fuscipes was also found to be the only species of actual importance as the cause of human dermatitis, though a few others were demonstrated to cause slight skin lesions under experimental conditions.

N2  - Recent collections of small mammals in Hokkaido have revealed the presence of four species of fleas not previously reported from this island. Two of these species are recorded from Japan for the first time. Additional collections will probably demonstrate that these species are common elements in the flea fauna of certain regions of Hokkaido, but they may be restricted to special habitats or certain seasons of the year.

N2  - In this article the status of Megabothris asio nakamurai Ono, 1955 is discussed, and the occurrence of this flea is reported from Honshu (the northern part of the Japan Alps, Nagano Prefecture). One pair of this form was collected from Rattus norvegicus and Microtus montebelli on May 31, 1957 by the author. Megabothris asio has been divided into three subspecies : asio, megacolpus, and nakamurai. The first two forms are Nearctic and the last was described from Hokkaido (Rebun Island) from Clethrionomys rufocanus. The relationship of the Japanese form seems closer to Megabothris sokolovi, and should porperly be called Megabothris sokolovi (Gershkovich, 1953). This rocord is another example of the similarity of species of Eastern Asia and Eastern North America.

N2  - In order to explain the variability of the effect due to various application technique of spot treatment using residual insecticides this investigation was carried out against cockroaches. This general method was employed by the author (1957) who used a model method, which seemed to give a condition similar to natural environment to adult German roaches used. Acetone solution of DDVP, γ-BHC, dieldrin and DDT are used in this test. It was experimentally confirmed that the satisfactory effectiveness could obtain so far as a insecticide has been applied on the surface of the shelter of the cockroaches or its adjacent objects. But, as regards the contact effect of spot treatment of DDT, the same fact is not always true. Because the efficiency of DDT against cockroaches is always lower than any of other compounds. However, if untreated concealment of the cockroaches is left, the effectiveness of any of the compounds is strongly influenced.

N2  - Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the effects of several insecticides against two species of cockroaches, Blattella germanica L. and Periplaneta japonica K.. The result are summarized of follows : Topical application method : By the application of 18μg per roach of the toxicants allethrin, DDVP, γ-60% BHC and diazinon, gave higher knockdown effcets than lindane and malathion. Those of dieldrin, aldrin and endrin were inferior to the above insecticides. Crude DDT and p-p' DDT caused no knockdown effect for five hours after treatment. However, in the mortality after 24 hours, dieldrin aldrin, endrin, allethrin and DDVP were almost at the same level and were more effective than the other chemicals. Similar results were obtained by treatment with 1.8μg per roach of toxicants except allethrin, which showed fairly low effect at this doses. Contact method : When Blattella germanica was brought into contact with glass plate of 100cm^2 treated by 0.5cc of 1% aceton solution of the toxicant, the order of knockdown effect was as follows : Allethrin>DDVP>γ-60% BHC>diazinon>lindane, malathion>dieldrin, aldrin, endrin, crude DDT, p-p' DDT. And with filter paper treated by the same amount of toxicant, the order changed as follows : DDVP>γ-60% BHC>allethrin>lindane, diazinon>dieldrin, endrin, crude DDT>malathion, p-p'DDT. During the observations on the mortality at 6 days after the treatments, DDVP, γ-60% BHC, diazinon, lindane and allethrin were only slightly more effective than the other chemicals, and all the chemicals tested showed of mortality over 95%. In the tests on the relationship between the time of exposure and the mortality with different insecticidal residues, dieldrin showed highest effects as 100% kill by 5 minute's exposure, while the similar effects were observed by 1 hour's exposure of diazinon and lindane. DDT was less effective on both B. germanica and P. japonica than the other chemicals through the test method discussed above.

N2  - LC-50s of various insecticides to mosquito larvae of some species collected from Tokyo district in 1952, 1953, 1956 and 1958, from Amami Oshima island in 1958, and from Bangkok in 1957, were obtained and compared with those of other foreign authors. Against Culex pipiens pallens and Aedes aegypti parathion was most effective, dieldrin was the next and the organic phosphorus insecticides, i. e. diazinon, DDVP and dipterex were the third. Aldrin, lindane and p-p'-DDT followed them. Aedes aegypti was three or four times more tolerant than C. pipiens pallens to every kind of larvicides used. While C. pipiens pallens showed stronger tolerance Armigeres subalbatus or Aedes albopictus to p-p'-DDT but they were nearly in the same level in the tolerance to dieldrin and lindane. It attracted the authors attension that A. subalbatus collected from Amami Oshima island where DDT had been heavily applied by U. S. Army was rather susceptible to p-p'-DDT, C. pipiens pallens and A. albopictus collected there were moderately resistant to the chemical, and by the other studies (Suzuki et al., 1958) also showed the same fact that also Musca vicina collected from the same district was resistant in high level. C. pipiens pallens collected from Tokyo district in 1958 was two to four times resistant against p-p'-DDT than the same species collected in 1952 or 1953, and comparing with the data obtained by foreign workers resistance was about ten times than C. pipiens fatigans, two to five times to lindane than collected in 1956 and about ten times than C. p. fatigans, three to twenty times to dieldrin than those collected in 1956, and ten to one hundred times than C. p. fatigans. As no dieldrin had been applied in the district, these increased resistance may be ascribed to the cross-resistance with lindane, which had been often applied for the control of mosquito larvae. To diazinon, one of the so-called organic phosphorus insecticides, the tolerance in C. p. pallens collected from Tokyo district in 1956 and 1958 was nearly in the same level. Aedes albopictus collected in 1958 was also about six times more resistant against p-p'-DDT than those collected in 1952 or 1953. Comparing the data presented here with those reported in foreign countries, A. albopictus collected from Tokyo district in 1958 and A. aegypti collected from Bangkok in 1957 were more tolerant than the same specimens in forign countries, especially on the latter species.

N2  - The protective effect of four repellents on the black fly, Simulium aokii Takahashi, 1941, were observed in the summer of 1958. The skin of calf or forearm of human was evenly covered by diluted repellents, such as diethyltoluamide, dimethylphthalate, MGK No.11 or MGK No.326 solution. Each repellent was diluted in ten times with pure ethylalcohol. Diethyltoluamide was most effective in four chemical tested. Ten percent solution of the chemical was effective throughout eight hours after the treatment. Any significant difference could not be shown in the efficacy between 10% and 20% solution of diethyltoluamide. But 10% cream of the chemical lost it's effect six hours after the treatment.

N2  - The present paper includes a revision of recent advances in the epidemiological studies on yellow fever in the world, and a review of papers dealing with the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, in the territory of Japan. A complete list of papers on Aedes aegypti in Japan is presented. Japan has never experienced an invasion of yellow fever in her territory. This is probably not because of the absence of mosquitoes which transmit the disease, but possibly due to the presence of other virus diseases, such as Japanese B encephalitis, which give rise to a partial immunity against yellow fever, as was suggested by Weissman and others (1957). Although Aedes aegypti is very much restricted in its distribution around this country, that of the related species of the same subgenus Stegomyia, or of other species suspected to transmit the virus, is extensive. The first extensive study on the distribution of Aedes aegypti in Japan was made by Yamada (1917). He could collect the specimens from Okinawa, Saipan and Bonin Islands, but not from the mainland. Previous to this, there appeared a few records on the presence of the species in this country. In the monograph of world mosquites by Theobald (1901), southern half of Honshu including Tokyo is included into the endemic area of Aedes aegypti. Miyajima (1910) also stated that the species is fairly common in Japan. It is obviously doubtflul whether these records were worthy of trust, but the possibility that the species might have established a temporary colony in those days can never completely be excluded. Recently, Oguri and Kobayashi (1947, 48) discovered the mosquito naturally breeding in the town of Ushibuka, Amakusa Island, South Kyushu. This was a home port of fishing boats going to and coming back from the South Pacific, and a colony of Aedes aegypti might have been introduced in these days. The fact was repeatedly verified by other workers, until Omori and others collected the last specimens on 26 Nov., 1956. However, repeated surveys made later by Omori and Sasa in the same area failed to detect the species. Also extensive survey of mosquitoes recently made by these workers covering Amami Islands or other southern districts of Japan to be suspected for its presence has all been negative. Japan has again missed the species from her territory. On the other hand, laboratory studies using Aedes aegypti experimentally introduced and bred in cages have been made since 1943 by Sasa (1944), Nakada (1946, 47, 57) and others. Miyao, Sasa and Hosoya (1944) utilized the species as the experimental vector of the bird malaria, Plasmodium gallinaceum. Laboratory colonies of Aedes aegypti is maintained in the author's laboratory, and studies on its bionomics and the resistance to various insecticides have been proceeded.

N2  - Although local outbreaks of the Far Eastern urticating moth, Euproctis flava Bremer, have frequently occured in various areas of Japan, especially it has been recognized popularly since the year of 1954, as one of the most important pests of public health in this country. Our knowledge concerning the basic biology, the control measures and the treatments of the dermatitis caused by the urticating properties appears still in an insufficient condition. Since 1955, the author and his associates have been engaged in a study on this pest, in particular, concerning entomological, pathological, chemical and clinical aspects. In this first part of a series of entomological works, the morphological observations of the eggs, larvae, pupae and the adults together with features of the urticating spicules have been described. Egg (Fig 1, 2) : The egg is pale green in colour, somewhat mandarin-shaped, and 0.63mm in long diameter, and 0.46mm in short diameter. Somewhat flattened dorso-ventrally, the under side somewhat concave. Egg shell is white in colour, surface with no sculpture. Eggs are deposited as an egg mass, which is thickly covered with the anal tuft hairs of the adult moth. Larva : Before reaching maturity, the larvae moult from 11 to 17 times. The number of moults is very variable with the individual, it seems to be influenced by various environmental factors. It was, therefore, impossible to associate the instar number to the morphological characters. However, based on the numbers and locations of the clusters of urticating spicules, they are divided into five types (Fig.5). Type A : lacking any urticating spicule and reversible gland, this type corresponds the first instar larva. Type B : with a pair of spicule clusters on the first abdominal segment, accompained with a reversible gland on sixth and seventh abdominal segments, respectively. This type is represented by larvae from second to tenth instars. Type C : with a pair of spicule clusters on the first and second abdominal segments. This type is represented from fifth to antepenultimate instar. Type D : with paired spicule tufts on the first, second and eighth segments. Penultimate instar. Type E : with two pairs of spicule clusters on the subdorsal line of first abdominal segment, and each a pair on the subdorsal line of second to eighth, with further addition of the spicule clusters on supraspiracular line of first to eighth, and on subspiracular line of first to sixth. This type corresponds the last instar (Fig 7). The larval hairs and spicules grow on the verrucae on the thoracic and abdominal segment. The shape of the hairs is variable, (they are) ordinary hairs, barbed hairs, slender hairs, and fine hairs, and three kinds of minute setae covering the legs, the verrucae and the other body surfaces. (Fig.3) Only urticating spicules are capable to irritates human skin. One single irritating spicule is needle shaped, the top is divided into 3 to 5 barbs, and there are numerous minute prickles on the surface of the shaft. The length is 0.053mm to 0.227mm, average about 0.118mm. (Fig.3, Table 1) The spicules are on the cup-shaped papilla, 7-8 spicules in average are counted in the unit papilla first to penultimate instar, but it increases up to 12 in the last instar. (Table 2). The number of the cup-papillae per cluster is different in the instar. The total number of the urticating spicules per larva naturally increses as the instar advances; they are, ca. 740 spicules in total in the second instar, ca. 3, 300 on fifth instar, 88, 000 on penultimate instar, 6, 525, 000 on the last instar (Table 3, 4) Pupa : In the female insect, the antenna is slender and the 7-10th abdominal segments are closely fused. In the male, the antenna is broader, and 8-10th abdominal segments united. (Fig.8) Adult : The moth is covered all over with yellow scales and hairs. In the fore wing, two black spots on the apex and a narrow blownish cross band on the median line are characteristic (Fig.9). The female moth is provided with long tuft of hairs at the abdominal end.

N2  - Very little attention has been paid to the human dermatitis caused by Oedemerid beetles. As the results of the author's investigation presented here, however, it has been elucidated that the disease were fairly common in various districts of Japan. In this paper the author intended to list up the species of Oedemerid beetles which cause dermatitis. There were involved some species newly reported as the cause. The mechanism of the occurence of dermatitis and the clinical symptoms were also traced experimentally. The main results are summarized as follows : 1. Except for the previously known species in Japan represented by Xanthochroa atriceps, X. waterhousei, X. hilleri and X. ainu, three more species were found to cause dermatitis in nature, namely Nacerdes melanura, Eobia cinereipennis and Eobia chinensis ambusta. Records of cases of dermatitis caused by Oedemerids in the world were briefly reviewed (Table 1). 2. By means of the patch-test, 24 species of the Japanese Oedemerids belonging to 12 genera were tested for the presence of the dermatitis-producing substances (Table 2). In case of fresh specimens, the materials were crushed and applied on the skin of forearm. In case of dried specimens, an extraction was made wth chloroform and after evaporating chloroform it was applied in a similar way mixed with vaselin. Thus the species, such as Anoncodes sambucea, Xanthochrca wadai, X. katoi, X. caudata, X. luteipennis, X. konoi, X. osawai, X. deformis, Chrysarthia viatica, Oedemerina concolor, Oedemeronia manicata and O. lucidicollis, were proved to cause dermatitis under experimental conditions. The toxic substance was identified as cantharidin in the succeeding experiments and the details of results were presented in another paper by the author and his colleague in this volume (pp.200-201). 3. Skin lesions caused by Oedemerid beetles were described in detail. After a few hours of the application of the toxic substance, bullae or vesicles of characteristic nature appear rather suddenly. They vary in shape and size, and also in number. They are light yellow to yellowish brown in colour, tense and convex as a rule, and apt to rupture by friction. The bullae are surrounded by a very narrow inflammatory halo and accompanied by some pain and itch. It usually takes a week or a little more before the lesions are completely healed, but, when the bullae are broken, pain becomes more intensive and cure is much delayed. They leave a well-defined pigmentation for a long period. 4. Various experiments were made to clarify the modes of occurence of dermatitis by contact with the beetles. Xanthochroa waterhousei, one of the most common species as the cause, was selected as the material in the experiment. The beetle never causes skin lesions when allowed to walk freely on the bare arm. However, it secretes the toxic fluid from the costae of elytra and the anterior and posterior margin of pronotum when irritated by pressure, such as compression with hand, or even when simply swept away with a finger. The toxic substance is contained in practically every part of beetle, as the lesions can be produced experimentally by rubbing the skin with isolated head, antenna, prothorax, meso-metathorax, elytron, wing, leg and abdomen respectively. Even the eggs or larvae were found to contain the toxin, and caused dermatitis by crushing them on the skin. 5. The practical significances of the Oedemerid beetles as the cause of human dermatitis differ in accordance with the species, and depend both on physiological and ecological characters of beetles. Members of the genera Anoncodina, Ezonacerda, Ditylus, Chrysarthia, Asclera, Oedemerina and Oedemernia may be of little significance since they are diurnal in activity and usually stay on wild plants and rarely come in contact with human life. Members of the genera Nacerdes, Xanthochrca, Eobia and Oncomerella are of epidemiological importance as they are habitually attracted by the light and offen crawl on human skin. Among the four genera listed above, at least first three are toxic, and consequently, they should be regarded as medically important groups. 6. Geographical distributions as well as abundance of populations in nature of the main Oedemerid species in Japan are also discussed. Xanthochroa osawai from Hokkaido, Eobia fuscipennis from Honshu (Niigata Pref.), Ezonacerda nigripennis and Xanthochroa asahinai from Shikoku, Xanthochroa konoi, Asclera brunneipennis, Asclera japonica, Eobia florilega and Oedemeronia manicata from Kyushu, and Asclera satana from Yakushima I. are all new records in the respective regions.

N2  - 1) Experimental infestation of the unengorged larvae of Trombicula akamushi, the vector species of the Tsutsugamushi disease, to human skin is presented. 2) The interval from the attachment of these larvae to the happening of prickly feeling was between 11 and 19 hours. And the formation of hyaline-like substance (or stylostome) may affect the role of the happening prickly feeling. 3) The extent of the resolved tissue in the skin by these larvae reached to the cutis.

N2  - 1. The distribution of trombiculid mites, during 1954 and 1957, in Osaka district is reported in this paper. 2. The 181 individuals (6 species of field vole and one species of mole) were captured. Apodemus speciosus was the common species among them. 3. 3 genera and 15 species of trombiculid mites identified, showidg the same fauna of other Kinki prefectures. In all districts, fuji, kitasatoi, japonica, tamiyai, kochiensis, kansai and Gahliepia saduski were common species, and tanaka-ryoi, palpalis, pallida, miyajimai, intermedia, kuroshio and E. ikaoensis were found on the mountain sides, but never in the plain lot. 4. The parasitic ratio of Microtus montebelli on the host role, was at the highest (151.3) and those of the Apodemus geisha and Rattus norvegicus were lower. According to the host species, considerable difference of parasitic features about trombiculid mites was found, which will be thought the presence of some larval association. 5. The variation was found in number of the abdominal dosal setae of species (pallida, palpalis, tanaka-ryoi, intermedia) and the variation was also discussed. 6. Seasonal prevalence of trombiculid mites at the Takayama province of Higashi-Nose village seemed to be two types. Kitasatoi type was formed all over the year but increased in number at spring and autumm, another type decreased at spring and summer, increased again in autumn, and reached to the mode in winter.

N2  - The author made a survey of the trombiculid fauna of Kagoshima district for the period from February, 1955 to March, 1957. No essential differences were seen between the localities of collection. (Fig.1) The localities of collection are Sakamotocho, Yamashitacho, Kamoikecho and Murasakibara of Kagoshima-shi, Kajikicho, Makizonocho and Maruo of Aira-gun, Irikicho and Miyanojocho of Satsumagun, Kushikino-shi and Oura of Kawanabe-gun. The hosts collected during this period are 28 Apodemus speciosus, 25 Microtus montebelli, 7 Rattus rattus, 41 Rattus norvegicus, 26 Suncus caeruleus and 5 Mustela itatsi, with the total of 132, covering 3 genera and 6 species. (Table 1) The species and the number of Tsutsugamushi (trombiculid mites) recovered from these hosts were as follows : Trombicula pallida, 478. T. fuji, 349. T. scutellaris, 292. T. kuroshio, 127. T. kansai, 1. T. japonica, 65. T. kitasatoi, 3. T. miyajimai, 1. T. murotoensis, 100. Gahrliepia saduski, 51. Doloisia okabei, 62. Total, 1, 572. 4 genera 12 species. (Table 2) The average numbers of the mites per host are by the oder of Microtus montebelli, Rattus norvegicus, Apodemus speciosus, Suncus caeruleus and Rattus rattus. Mustella itatsi also harboured fairly large number of trombiculids. No specific relations could be seen between distribution of the mites and temper ature or precipitation. (Fig 3 & 4) As for the correlations to the type of lands, T. pallida and T. murotoensis seemed to prefer culivated fields to meadows, while the relation was reverse in T. fuji, T. kuroshio and T. japonica.

N2  - The author made a survey of the distribution of Tsutsugamushi (trombiculid mites) of Osumi region, Kagoshima, for the period of one year from March, 1955 to March, 1956. Localities of collection are as follows : 1. Kushira-cho, Kagoshima : forests, sweetpotato fields, barley fields, residential areas and sweet-potato pots at Oaza-Kamikobaru and Arisato. 2. Koyama-cho, Kagoshima : Sweet-potato fields at Oaza-Tomiyama. 3. Uchinoura-cho, Kagoshima : Sweet-potato fields and rice-fields along the opposite bank of residential area. 4. Sata-cho, Kagoshima : Sweet-potato fields on a hill-slope. A badger was caught in mountain about 1.5km distant from the sea-side. 5. Nakamachi, Kushima-shi, Miyazaki : Ricefields along a lake, about 50m distant from the residential area. A total of 897 trombiculid mites of 3 genera and 13 species were recovered from 56 small mammals and a badger. Microtus montebelli, Apodemus speciosus and Urotricus talpoides harboured the mites, but all of twelve Rattus norvegicus was free from the trombiculids. Species of the mites were represented by Trombicula fuji, T. kuroshio, T. kansai, T. kitasatoi, T. scutellaris, T. miyajimai, T. murotoensis, T. japonica, T. kochiensis, T. intermedia, T. pallida, Gahrliepia saduski and Shuhsennia tarsalis. It was been demonstrated that region at the south most end of Japan mainland is also very rich in trombiculid fauna. Attension should be paid to the fact that a large number of T. scutellaris, which has been regard as the vector of Tsutsugamushi disease in certain areas of Japan, could be collected from Myctereutes procyonoides viverrinus. Further study is needed to elucidate whether the disease acutually occurs in this area. Among a number of meteological factors which may affect the distribution of trombiculid mites in this region, the temperature seemed to exhibit an effect, while no correlations could be demonstrated with other factors.

N2  - In September, 1952, K. Kitahara collected two larvae of Erythraeidae which lived on the horse-fly in Kuroshima, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan and he described them in 1953. The authors made a cross examination and corrected the errors. Leptus kuroshimaensis n. sp. Description of Larva (Type) : (The value of various measuring described formerly in 1953). Colour in life red. Body ovoid. Dorsal scutum pentagonal; its anterior margin and its posterior point slightly concave. Anterior part of shield is not thin and carries the slender sensillary setae which is finely ciliated on the terminal 1/3; the posterior sensillary setae which is finely ciliated on the terminal half arise at the posterior angle of the shield; 2 pairs of non-sensillary setae, slightly club-liked in shape, short and stiffly ciliated. Eye : 1+1, on a level with the posterior end of the shield. The forms of 60 dorsal setae are similar with scutal non-sensillary ones. Venter : a pair of setae, with many ciliations, between coxae I, II and III, respectively; between coxae II and III a pair of setae. Ventral surface has not urstigmen and anus. Gnathosoma : the terminal half of mandible is very narrow, its tip with very small claw; gnathosomal dorsal surface without galea-setae; hypostom has a pair of anterior very short spine-like setae and a pair of posterior long non-ciliated setae; palpal femur, genu, tibia, tarsus with 1, 1, 3, 8 setae, respectively; palpal claw strong and simple (no accessory teeth). Legs long and thin, with 7 segments : each coxa with one seta, slightly tapering. Each trochanter with one seta. Tarsi long; empodium falciform and simple, most long and thin, overreaching the lateral claws; anterior claw fairly strong, falciform, without ciliations; posterior claw fairly strong, with slightly curved shaft, tapering, with a number of ventral ciliations. Tarsi I and II with one spur on the dorsum, respectively. Tarsus I, tibia I, genu I, tarsus II, tibia II, genu II, tarsus III, tibia III provided with 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1 1, 1, non-ciliated simple setae, respectively. Discussion : a) This species very resembles to genus Achorolophus Oudemans, but is easily distinguished from followings : (1) by the galea of the latter dorsally with setae, (2) the hypostom of the latter with a pair of setae except for Ach. lomani (but Ach. lomani with triangular scutum, its posterior angle pointed) and (3) in what the latter has a anus. b) This species also looks like Leptus anomalus Southcott but is easily distinguished from the latter in the following character : (1) the dorsal scutum pentagonal, its anterior part being not thin and more concave than the latter. (2) between coxae II are only a pair of satae. (3) anterior hypostomal setae non-ciliated, spine-like. (4) gnathosoma without galea-setae. (5) palpal genu has only one seta. (6) posterior claw has only ventral ciliations, without dorsal ones. c) Leptus kyushuensis Ishii which seems almost equal to this species differs considerably from followings : (1) in having the wide branched terminal to the posterior claw, (2) 7 setae to the palpal tarsus and (3) in what all tarsal setae are ciliated except for one spur.

N2  - As the part of the author's study on the oribatoid mites fauna of Japan, identification and description of the species which has been recognized as the intermediate host of the sheep tapeworm, Moniezia expansa, are presented in the present paper. The species was reported by Watanabe (1957) as the natural intermediate host of the tapeworm in Niigata district, but the identification has been left undetermined. Out of some 80 species of oribatoid mites collected by the author from various parts of Japan, it represents one of the most common species, the localities of collection covering from Hokkaido to Kyushu. The specimens have been recovered from various types of lands, such as forests, meadows and even goat-barns. Their habitats were under fallen leaves, stones or rotten woods. The tentative identification of the species is made as Oribatula venusta Berlese, 1908. The diagnostic characters of the species discussed here are as follows : Brilliant brown to yellow in color.

N2  - In the present paper, the influence of temperature upon the abdominal pattern of Aedes vexans var. nipponii was studied with special reference to the taxonomical view point, with the comparison of three varieties, vexans Mg., vexans var. stenoetrus Theo. and vexans var. nipponii Theo. Increassng of individuals possessing the abdominal pattern showing vexans type was recognized in the rearing of larvae coming from nipponii type mosquito under the higher temperature condition, but the original nipponii type pattern was kept strongly by the rearing under the lower temperature condition. Judging from the present experiment it seems questionable from the taxonomical view point that the difference between vexans and vexans var. nipponii described by Edwards is present.

N2  - New species after new species has been discovered of black flies in Japan, adding to the knowledge in this insect. On Mt. Daisen of Tottori Prefecture, we obtained specimen believed to be a new species belonging to the subgenus Eusimulium, and its morphology has been studied. The pupa of this species was discovered in 1955 by Yoshida, Sato and Shogaki. It occurs in very small numbers at limited areas of high mountains. Only pupae having been collected, the characteristics of the adult was unknown until Okamoto in 1957 succeeded in raising adults from pupae he had collected. The morphology of this species has thus been clarified. This new species is now named "Simulium (Eusimulium) kobayashii" after Dr. Harujiro Kobayashi. The writers express their gratitudes to Dr. H. Kobayashi and Prof. Dr. M. Nagahana for their directions on the present studies. Acknowledgement with thanks is also expressed for the assistances given by Mr. K. Kamei, Mr. N. Matsubara, Miss K. Nishio, Mr. Z. Sugihara, and Mr. S. Oda.

N2  - One and a half cc of 0.5% diazinon, malathion, and lindane emulsion or 0.5cc of 0.5% pyrethrins solution in xylene was applied to a filter paper, 11cm of diameter. After drying the filter paper in room temperature for 1 day, 1cc or 2cc of water was added to the paper, and then 10 adult house flies were transferred to a petri dish under which the paper was set. The knockdown percentage of the flies was recorded. The results of the test indicate that the addition of water remarkably increases the effects of malathion, diazinon, or pyrethrins to house flies, but such effect was not so remarkable in lindane. The effect of malathion or lindane applied on glass plate was superior to that applied on filter paper. Malathion was more effective than lindane if applied on glass plate, whereas the latter was more effective than the former when applied on filter paper.

N2  - The present experiment was designed to identify the toxic substance of the dermatitis-causing beetle, Xanthochroa waterhousei Harold (Coleoptera : Oedemeridae). The substance could be extracted from the adults by the modified Dragendorff's method and purified into white chrystals with the melting point of 215-216℃. The molecular formula was C_<10>H_<12>O_4. This substance was identified as cantharidin by the mixed melting point with the authentic specimen and by the infrared absorption spectrum (Fig. 1). 0.12% of the substance could be recovered from the fresh bodies, about 20% of which was estimated to form salt with water-soluble alkaline metal.

N2  - Successive studies on the seasonal prevalences of mosquitoes were carried out during the period of three years from 1954 to 1956 at two or four places in Yonago City using light trap and at a place using exhauster in 1954 especially, and following results were obtained. 1. Number of mosquitoes collected were 4 genera, 12 species, 8, 793 individuals in 1954, 4 genera, 13 species, 16, 514 individuals in 1955, and 3 genera, 11 species, 4, 684 individuals in 1956 respectively. Culex pipiens, C. tritaeniorhynchus, and Anopheles sinensis occupied the great majority of the specimens (approximately 96 to 98% each year). C. pipiens decreased number of specimens collected from 1954 to 1956, i. e. 75, 56, and 19% respectively, while C. tritaeniorhynchus increased percentage gradually (11, 28, and 75%) and became top of the species in 1956. 2. The tendency of decreasing number of individuals was observed in 1956 than 1955, especially C. pipiens decreased remarkably. And number of C. tritaeniorhynchus collected at Nishi Machi also decreased to approximately half of individuals in 1955. These phenomena may be caused by artificial changes of habitats, such as spray of insecticides, etc. 3. The male of C. pipiens collected always more than the female and A. sinensis showed almost similar tendency, but no such fact was observed in C. tritaeniorhynchus. 4. The seasonal prevalences of the species mentioned above were as follows : C. pipiens : First collection of female and male were in the middle of March and at the beginning of May respectively and ended in the middle or the end of November. The peak of population curve was observed from the middle of June to the beginning of July. C. tritaeniorhynchus : Appeared in the middle of June or at the beginning of July, came to the peak at the end of July or the beginning of August, and ended at the end of October. A. sinensis : Appeared at the beginning or in the middle of June, became peak in the middle of July to the end of August, and ended at the end of October. 5. The patients of Japanese B encephalitis appeared 10 to 30 days after the peak of C. tritaeniorhynchus.

N2  - 1) The observation on the seasonal prevalence of mosquitoes has been made at a cow barn in Kamo City, Niigata Prefecture, from March 1956 to May 1957 with the exception of winter season. 2) This collection has been made two or three times in each 10 days during the period using an insect net, and the total number of mosquitoes obtained was 3, 366, consisting of 52.5% Aedes vexans nipponii, 26.6% Anopheles sinensis, 11.6% An. sineroides, 6.8% Culex tritaeniorhynchus, 2.2% C. pipiens pallens, 0.3% Armigeres subalbatus, and 0.0% Aedes albopictus (Table 1). 3) Each of these species had their own seasonal prevalence as shown in Fig. 1 and 2. An. sinensis and An. sineroides appeared early in April and could not collect at the end of November. An. sinensis exhibited two definite peaks in occurrence, on the contrary An. sineroides showed nearly three peaks. Ae. vexans nipponii appeared in the middle of May, and disappeared in the middle of October, exhibiting two distinct peaks, the highest one was formed early in June. C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. pipiens pallens appeared early in July and disappeared late in September. 4) C. tritaeniorhynchus showed a small peak in occurrence early in August, on the contrary C. pipiens pallens did not show any peak.

N2  - Observations were made on the attracting effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to mosquitoes in the field where the population was exclusively composed of Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1859). Types of mosquito traps were deviced with which numbers of the mosquito attracted could be counted under various conditions. Physical and chemical factors, such as carbon dioxide, radiating heat, humidity, which would be generated by a host and might act as the attractant of the mosquitoes, were tested by using the traps. The first type of traps was desinged to count the numbers of mosquitoes flying around or staying on a metal can; as for the source of carbon dioxide, a piece of dry-ice covered with a few layers of gauze set on the can was found to be most satisfactory; the effect of heat was observed by placing a glass bottle containing hot water in the can; effects of the surface materials and of the humidity on the number of mosquitoes rested on the traps were tested by covering the can with two layers of gauze soaked in water. Comparative studies were made using several traps with or without setting the factors mentioned above. The second type of traps was constructed to collect the mosquitoes attracted around the equipments placing dry-ice, warm bottles either exposed or covered with gauze layers in a large box, the opening of which could be closed when an observer wanted to finish the experiment. The number of mosquitoes trapped in the box was counted by narcotising them with ether. The results showed the following conclusions : 1. CO_2 exhibitted a remarkable attracting effect on the mosquitoes. If it applied alone without combining other factors, the mosquitoes in the field were attracted and flew around in the range of a few inches from the dry-ice, but did not rest on the surface. 2. Temperature in itself did not attract the mosquito, but obviously increased the number when applied in combination with carbon dioxide; in other words, it acted as the auxiliary attractant. 3. The numbers of resting mosquitoes found on a surface of equipments after attracted by the above stated factors were much influenced by their characters; metal can or glass bottle did not allow the mosquites to rest on the surface, but if covered by gauze, many of them were found to land on it and exhibit biting actions using their proboscis. No significant differences were seen between the numbers of mosquitoes attracted on dry and on wetted gause. Through the above presented results, it is assumed that the mosquitoes are first attracted towards the source of carbon dioxide, then arrested by a heat source of adequate strength, and further select of the surface to rest on will be made by its external characters. Attraction of the mosquitoes showing their biting actions was thus demonstrated by using a model simulated as human body, and a part of the mechanisms of their parasitic activities were analysed.

N2  - The author found the larvae of Aedes rossicus in the wooden tank at Tsuta-Onsen, Towada, Aomori Prefecture, could rear in the laboratory, and obtained male and female specimens and their associated larval and pupal skins. The condition of adult specimens were not so satisfactory, that the male and female terminalia and larva, together with Stackelberg's description of adult were described. Thus all Palearctic species belonging subgenus Aedes (6 species) have been known from Japan, the keys to male and female terminalia and larvae were presented in this paper. Although the adults are hard to identify, presence of additional hairs on siphon of the larva, seta on the process of claspette, shape and number of submedian setae of 9th tergite are distinguished from known species of Japan.

N2  - Experiments were made to estimate the population size and behaviors of commensal rats, Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus, by the amount of food consumptions experimentally distributed at various localities in certain buildings. In the first experiment made in an animal house with concrete floor, the amount of food consumed per rat was estimated. In an animal house with concrete floor, baits were distributed at about 20 different localities and the amounts of food consumption were weighed every morning for successive days. After that, collection of rats using snap-traps was made until no more rats could be trapped and no more rat signs were observed. The amount of consumptions at each bait-box varied greatly by the localities, and the home ranges of the rats could thus be estimated. The total amounts of food consumption per day were, however, fairly constant and was calculated as 8.1g per day per rat in ricebran, 9.8g in dog biscuit, 8.7g in cerials and 9.4g in the same cerial containing warfarin. Experiments repeated under similar conditions yielded values of related level. In the next stage of experiments made under the environments where it was difficult to trap all of the rats inhabiting the areas, the value of food consumptions per rat was estimated by comparing the differences of the consumed amounts before and after trappings with the number of rats killed by the traps. The results were 14 to 15g in one colony, and 30g in the other. In a laboratory observations made with nine brown rats with the average body weight of 134g, which were kept isolately in cages, the average amount of consumption of dog-food per day was 20g and that of water 27cc. Home ranges as well as the movements of colonies of the brown rats were observed in an laboratory-animal shed by applying the bait method and the trapping methods, under mark-and-release system or snap-trap system. In the first period of observations, the activities of a colony were confined to the east side of the house. After about 45 days, an invasion of a new colony took place in the other side of the building. Comparative studies were made with a number of diets composed of different mixtures of food materials. Maximum values of consumption was seen in the mixture of wheat flour, corn meal and cooking oil. The amounts of food consumption by rats are influenced by their body weights, the kinds of baits and also by the environments. Estimation of the population size as well as its movements may be estimated to certain extent by the above stated bait-method if such factors would be taken into considerations.

N2  - 1) The specimens of the black fly were collected in the city areas of Tottori and Yonago. 2) Eggs, larvae and pupae of the species were identified, and the morphology for all stages of its development was clarified and described. 3) This species was clarified to belong to the subgenus Boophthora Enderlein. 4) This species appears to be new, and Simulium (Boophthora) yonagoense was proposed as the new name. 5) Laboratory rearing of this species from egg to adult could be successfully carried out using the method similar as the rearing method of S. salopiense reported by Yoshida and Nakanishi in 1956. 6) The larval stage reared at 10 to 15℃ was for 26 to 31 days, and at about 20℃ for 13 to 24 days. 7) The pupal stage at about 10℃ was for 9 to 12 days, averaging about 10 days, and at about 20℃ for 2 to 6 days, averaging a little more than 3 days. 8) The size of the adults reared indoors from eggs was not much different from that collected in the nature. The sex ratio of the species generated indoors was also practically the same as that observed in the nature. 9) The present species is distinguished from S. argyreatum, S. heringi, and S. bujakovi of the same subgenus by the absence of spots and the presence of sparse silver-white pubescence on the mesonotum and by blackish brown color all over the femora. The present species is also distinguished from its morphologically similar species of S. tuberosum by the velvet black mesonotum, by the color of the pubescence of the mesonotum, and by the dendriform construction of the respiratory filament.

N2  - The reactions of full grown larvae of S. salopiense and S. aokii to lindane and DDT were studied in the laboratory. The LD_<50> after 30 seconds exposure are 4ppm in lindane emulsion, 54ppm in DDT emulsion and 105ppm in DDT paste, respectively. The LT_<50> in 1ppm lindane emulsion, 10ppm DDT emulsion and 10ppm DDT paste are 1 minute, 1.7 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. On this observations, moreover, considerable numbers of larvae have pupated after 30 seconds exposure in high concentration of insecticides. These results suggest that the Simulium larvae have no small resistance against these insecticides.

N2  - In this paper it is given the result of one year's observation beginning April, 1956 on the prevalence of various Diptera collected from a poultry ranch in Kaida, Hirosima Prefecture, Japan. The poultry ranch and the breeding boxes surveyed are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The flies were bred to the adults from a certain amount (each about 3kg) of chicken excrements. Fifteen species of flies were collected, these are devisible into 11 genera, which are classified into 8 families (Table 1). The dominant species were Tephrochlamys sp., Fannia sp. I, Fannia sp. II and Ptecticus tenebrifer. But, these are, as is shown by their behavior, the fly species of lesser public health importance. However, it is worthy to note from the view point of the fly control program, that there found flies of public health importance such as Musca vicina, Stomoxys calcitrans, Muscina stabulans, Fannia canicularis, Calliphora lata, Sarcophaga peregrina and etc., in a considerable number. The majority of them emerged out during May to September.

In all cases, the killing effects were from 80 to 100 percent. While 0.01% emulsion of malathion, dipterex and dieldrin were sprayed, the effects were only a few percent. One percent malathion emulsion was sprayed against the side walls of pens at the rate of 80cc per square meter and the effect on the house fly population was estimated by counting the number of adults found on hog bodies. The house fly population remarkably dropped for at least in a period of one week after the application. The residual effects, however, could be demonstrated for three weeks.

N2  - The author has collected the oribatid mites in various parts of Japan. Three methods of collection were applied; Modified Berlese's funnel method (drying cone method), Watanabe's wood plate method and Direct collection technic. Berlese's funnel method was one of the best technics for the survey of the fauna of the mites. Direct collection method with badger hair brush was most simple but non-efficient technic. Watanabe's collection technic with wood plate was one of the effective and simple methods of collection for oribatid mites, especially Oribatula sp. (Or. -1). The author also collected this species by the same method. Tested woods were fresh cider and old pine plate. Many mites were collected on pine plate in the morning. Collected mites were kept in plastic vessel, which contained plaster of Paris and charcoal in the bottom. In this medium the adult mites lived for several months to one year. In the early autumn of 1957, the diurnal rhythmic activity of oribatid mites, Oribatula sp. (Or. -1), the intermediate host of Moniezia expansa in Japan was observed in a pine-forest in Kashiwazaki City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The number of the oribatid mites observed on the undersurface of old pine plates, which had been placed on the ground 12 hours before the observations were counted every hour for 26 hours. The number of observed mites on the undersurface of plates was about 70% of the total number counted on both sides of the plates. The ratio was almost constant in the daytime (from 7.00 A.M. to 10.00 A.M.) as well as in the night time (from 6.00 P.M. to 5.00 A.M.). The number of mites observed on cider plates were less in number than on pine plates. The environmental factors as the soil temperature 5cm beneath the ground surface, the air temperature and relative humidity 5cm above the soil surface, were recorded at the each time of observations. It was revealed that the number of the mites observed on the undersurface of pine plates showed significant positive correlation to the air and soil temperature.

N2  - The investigations of the distributions of early stages of black flies in Nasu area, Kanto district, were made by the authors, in October, 1956 and January, 1957. The species collected in the area of about 500km^3, are shown in the list. The majority of the specimens collected were occupied by S. venustum, S. ornatum and S. bidentatum. The phenomenon of the habitat segregation in a stream (River Sabi) was observed. And according to the distribution of black flies, this stream seemed to devide into 3 habitat groups, consisting P. hirtipes+S. japonicum; S. venustum+S. bidentatum+S. ornatum+S. aokii+S. decorum+S. tuberosum+S. subcostatum+S. uchidai; S. bidentatum+S. venustum, respectively.

Four genera, 14 species of adult mosquitoes were collected in the houses and Culex pipiens, C. tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis occupied the great majority of the specimens (80-90%). 2. In 1952, the peak of seasonal population curves of C. pipiens lied on the latter part of July, while in 1953, it lied on the middle or latter part of June. 3. Of C. tritaeniorhynchus and A. sinensis, it lied during the period from the latter part of July to the middle of August.

N2  - The work here reported concerns biting-midges collected during the period from May to October, 1956, in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Culicoides collected are 14 species (See the list of species). C. arakawae has been widely found over the plains and the hilly regions. C. circumscriptus has been prevalent along the seashore and the area of the saline hot-springs. While, C. matsuzawai was prevalent amongst Okutadami, the mountainous district. According to our observations on C. circumscriptus at Matsunoyama-village, the larvae have been abundantly found in the slime of the gutter draining, the water which contains 3% Sod. Chl., 37°, pH 8.5-10.0 and was constantly discharging from the saline hot-spring. And the adults attack violently against human beings and their main biting activity reaches a distinct peak at dusk.

N2  - The effects of larval population density on the body weight, the length of pupae and on the duration of pupation using larvae of the common housefly, Musca domestica vicina MACQ. are presented in this paper. As the culture medium of larvae, mixture of 25g of powdered Oriental Compressed Diet for Experimental Animals (for a mouse, rat and hamster), 25g of wheat bran and 50cc of water kept in a petri dish measuring 9cm in diametar and 6cm in height were prepared. The population of larvae were chosen in twofold steps as 20, 40, 80 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 2560 individuals respectively and some middle scales as 960 and 1920 were added supplementally. Second day's batches of larvae were transferred to dishes and all pupae were served for measurement after 7 days which were cultured at 25℃. Frequency curves of body weight were biassed towards lighter side of the mode in lower population densities. As population densities increase, their forms approached to the normal distribution. The curves moved towards the lighter side in a remarkable degree when densities were 640 or more individuals (Fig. 1). The maximum value of body weight was obtained at the density of 40 individuals, and the body weight decreased gradually as the increase of population density up to 320, but it decreased remarkable when the density rose to 640. It seemed that the lowest level was kept within certain limits of fluctuation in higher population densities. Mean lengths of pupae were longer and their standard deviations were smaller in a range of wider population densities compared with Nagasawa's result using "okara" (residual product of bean-curd) medium (Fig. 2). The pupation was accomplished from 5 to 9 days after the oviposition in the population densities between 20 and 320 individuals, but the duration prolonged from 5 to 16 days when the population density attained over 640. The mass weight as well as the number of pupae recovered at various population densities were plotted on the double logarithmic scales. The value fitted well in linear regression in the range of from 20 to 320 larvae in the former and from 20 to 640 in the latter, but were dislocated from them in higher population densities, suggesting there existed another phase of population effects (Fig. 4). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was seen between the number of pupae recovered and their body weight in the dislocated part. From the ecological concept, the productivity of culture medium will be expressed as density-proportional to the biomass until the population density reaching 320 individuals, as density-independent when over that densiy it sustains constant biomasses for a results of intraspecific competition which would been occurred by the population pressure. The population density of 320 individuals was assumed the optimum for mass culture of the common housefly under this culture condition from the following facts. Under this population density, no distinct decrease in the body weight was demonstrated comparing with those of lower populations. The rate of pupation in the density of 20 to 640 increase in some degree, but 320 group showed the best reproducible results. Until 320 individuals, duration of pupation little varies in the increase of the population density.

N2  - The surveys on larval habitats of flies of medical importance were carried out on July 1957, at the residential quarter of Mitsubishi Kogyo Co. in Ashibetsu City, Hokkaido and the most important habitat of the larva, Fannia canicularis, the dominant species in houses of this district, was found in steeper of 'Takuwan', Japanese pickled garden radishes using rice-bran and salt as media. F. can. was found in steepers of 56 families and Muscina stabulans was found in 28 families out of 112. While, by the general surveys following species of fly larvae were collected.. Garbage box : Phaenicia sericata, Ophyra leucostoma, M. stabulans (these three species occupied the majority number of individuals), F. can., Sarcophaga peregrina and Lucilia illustris.; Lavatory : Calliphora lata, S. pereg., S. similis (those three showed majority number), F. can., F. scalaris and M. stab.; Pig-pen : M. stab. and Lucilidae sp.; Chicken house : F. can. and O. leuc.; Rabbit house : O. leuc.; Vegetable manure heap : Sarcophagidae sp.. Number of individuals collected from animal sheds was few. From the results obtained by the surveys in Ashibetsu, similar surveys on steepers were carried out at several districts in Hokkaido, Akita, Tokyo and Kanagawa on July, August for comparison. High popularized rate of 'Takuwan' was observed in rural and fishery villages than town district and high occurrence rate of F. can. was found in northern part of Japan than the south. The larvae found in Takuwan steepers were swarms of F. can. alone or mixture of F. can. and M. stab. and no swarm of M. stab. alone was found. The occurrences of the two species mentioned above differ by the conditions inside of steeper, i. e. M. stab. seems to like more water content in the media than F. can.. Although the most important habitat of F. can. larvae in Hokkaido is 'Takuwan' steeper, but habitats as lavatory and animal shed may have also importance in town district of Honshu and southern part of Japan. The control method for steeper was discussed in this paper, but the problems of other habitats and their control will be studied and discussed in the future.

N2  - In order to estimate the residual effect of several organic insecticides using adult German roach a model method designed by the author was introduced. The residual effect was judged by the knockdown percentage, at intervals up to six months after the application. It has been shown that the efficient duration of the test insecticides as shown by 95% knockdown, was in the following sequence : 0.5% Dieldrin oil solution, six months; 0.5% Diazinon oil solution and mixed with 5% DDT plus 0.2%γ-BHC oil solution, two months; 0.5% γ-BHC oil solution, fifteen days. 5% DDT oil solution gave no 95% knockdown. Even in the initial toxicity DDT was lower than any of the other compounds, but, throughout the duration of experiment, it showed a residue persistence at about 77.5% knockdown in average.

N2  - For the purpose of estimating the population size and home ranges of the house rat Rattus norvegicus, an investigation was made in a laboratory animal shed. The effects of snap-traps as the control measure on the rat were also observed after the above stated experiments. The mark and release operation were carried on for successive 8 days, untill no unmarked rats could be recovered. The number of total marked rats attained was 41. Estimation of the population size by the graphic method using the linear equation (E)Y=(N-x)P resulted in 40, thus showing a coincidence between the theoretical and actial sizes. (Y : the ratio of marked individuals to the total number captured in a single operation. N : the number captured. x : the cumulated number of captured rats. p : probability of capturing a rat) The real population size, however, was estimated to be larger, because of the presence of individuals not exposed to the cage-traps. During course of the snap-trap collections made later, 13 unmarked rats were trapped besides 19 marked individuals. The probabilities of capture for unmarked (P) and the marked (π) were calculated as 0.357 and 0.196, respectively. It was presumed in this case that rats, once captured, showed the behaviour to be less easily trapped than the unmarked. The average distance between the localities of the successive captures in each individual was calculated as 6.53m for a male and 4.96m for a female. Home ranges of 50% of the males were estimated as less than 36.1 square meters, and as 33.5 square meters in the females. The males seemed to cover more areas than the females.

N2  - Surveys on the ectoparasites of the wood mice, Apodemus speciosus, at several plots in Wakayama Prefecture have been carried out by the authors since 1954. And part of their results were already reported and analysis on the relationship between species of chigger mites distributed in this district and environmental factors were made in this paper. The name of plots surveyed and dates are as follows : Kimi (Hashimoto-Shi, Feb., 1955), Wakayama-Castle (Wakayama-Shi, Nov., 1954), Tsugi (Hirokawa-Cho, Arita-Gun, Feb., 1956), Karao (Hirokawa-Cho, from July, 1954 to June, 1955), Minabe (Minabe-Cho, Hidaka-Gun, March, 1954), Nishitonda (Tanabe-Shi, March, 1954), Ryujin-Mura, Hidaka-Gun, Apr., 1955), Oshima (Oshima-Mura, Higashimuro-Gun, March, 1956), Nachi (Nachi-Katsuura-Cho, Higashimuro-Gun Aug., 1954), Kitayama (Kitayama-Mura, Higashimuro-Gun, March, 1956). Almost similar results were obtained through the surveys except Kimi area, i. e. similar species were observed and dominant species in each plots were T. fuji and T. kitasatoi. While at Karao area where the seasonal occurrences of larval chiggers were recorded, the dominant species in warm season is T. kitasatoi and T. fuji in cold season. No remarkable differences were found in vegitation and agronomical factors in each plots, but climatic factors, such as average temperature and rainfall of each month, affected on the seasonal occurrence of the larval chigger mites. The chiggers in most of all plots form up rainfall type and the species in colder plots, such as Ryujin and Kitayama, correspond to that of colder season in Karao, the plots where no difference in temprature and more rain are observed, such as Oshima and Nachi, correspond to that of warmer season in Karao, and the plots where no remarkable differences in temperature and rainfall are observed, such as Tsugi, Minabe and Nishitonda, correspond to that of similar season in Karao respectively. Differences in climatic and geographical factors may affect on distribution of the species in Kimi, where the species differs to the other plots.

N2  - Observations on the differences in several species of rodents as the host of Trombicula scutellaris were made in February, 1957, at Hachijo Island, south of Tokyo, where Shichito-type Tsutsugamushi disease was prevalent. Four species of rodents, Mus musculus (laboratory white mouse), Rattus norvegicus (laboratory white rat), Microtus montebelli and Meriones unguiculatus were used as the experimental hosts for comparison. As was reported in the previous papers, unengorged larvae of Trombicula scutellaris were found to form clusters on the soil surface, especially on tops of rocks or stones, in very season of the year. Infestation of the mites on the hosts were caused by contacting the rodents directly with the clusters. The hosts were kept separately in cages shown in Fig. 1, and the number of mites dropped off from hosts were counted every 6 hours. From Mus, Rattus and Meriones, considerable numbers of unengorged larvae were recovered during the first 6 hours, and engorged larvae could obtain between 12 to 78 hours, with a peak at 30 hours. In the case of Microtus, the time required for engorgement of larvae was found to be considerably longer than in the former species, and the peak appeared about 24 hours later, some being still attached even after 78 hours. The ratio of number of engorged larvae to the unengorged one was also higher in Microtus than in the other species. The results seem to have solved at least a part of the question why Microtus in the fields harbour more mites than other rodent species collected in the same localities.

N2  - I. During the investigations of the chigger prarasites of the Japanese hares (Lepus timidus brachyurus, L. t. lyoni, L. t. angustidens) in several Prefectures of Japan, such as Shizuoka, Saitama, Tokyo, Chiba, Yamanashi, Kanagawa, Gunma, Niigata and Fukushima, there were found ten species of chiggers, Trombicula scutellaris, T. fuji, T. pallida, T. palpalis, T. kitasatoi, T. sp., T. japonica, T. ngayoi?, Euschongastia miyagawai and Neoschongastia shiraii, and one undescribed species of the genus Gahrliepia (Walchia). Of these, E. miyagawai was the commonest, for example, 5, 000 specimens of this species were examined on a single host in Shizuoka Prefecture in January. The summary of collection records of the chiggers in the surveys are shown in table 4. II. The species of Gahrliepia (Walchia) is described and named G. (W.) masoni in appreciation of the favor extended to the author by Dr. Richard P. Mason, the Director of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, U.S.A. It is characterized by the following features : Galeal seta usually nude, rarely barbed. Palpal femoral, genual, dorsal and ventral tibial setae feathered ; lataral tibial seta usually nude, rarely barbed. Scutum tongue-like, about 1.6 times as long as broad, and much prolonged posteriorly behind the level of posterolateral setae. Usual scutal setae rather slender, with short branches on the entire surface. Sensillary setae capitate, with many fine barbs on the swelled apex. For scutal measurements see table 1. Dorsal setae similar to the usual scutal setae, and arranged typically as 2-6-8-6-6-4-4-2, and about 36 to 38 in number. Sternal setae 2-2. Coxae untisetose. Nude or sensillary setae on legs arranged as in figure 2. It is of interest to note that a microspur is situated proximad of a spur in tarsus I, and tarsus II is absent in a pretarsala, while femur III bears a femorala-like seta having only one or two fine barbs. Types are preservd in the writers' collections which were taken from Lepus timidus brachyurus, L. t. lyoni, L. t. angustidens in Shizuoka, Kanagawa Niigata and Saitama Prefectures. This species is somewhat related to G. (W.) turmalis Gater, 1932, but differs in having branched setae at least on palpal articles II and III. This work is aided in part through a Grant in Aid for Scientific Research under Cont. No. DA-92-557-EFC-23, 611 between Dr. Takeo Tamiya and Office of the Surgeon General, U.S.A.

The material consists of five specimens taken from a Japanese hedge-sparrow, Prunella rubida rubida, at Chichibu district, Saitama Prefecture, Japan, on December 24, 1955. This species is named in honour of Dr. Joseph E. Smadel, Acting Director of the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md., U.S.A., for his encouragement and favor extended to the study of Tsutsugamushi disease in Japan. 2. This new species is easily distinguished from the known species of the genus, M. empodiformis Traub et Evans, 1950 and M. todai Kamo, 1953, by a nude galeal seta, a nude ventral seta of palpal article IV, concave posterior margin of scutum, sensillae situated anteriorly far beyond the level of posterolateral setae, and also by the arrangement of dorsal and sternal setae, 4(5)-6-6(4)-4(6)-2(4)-4(2)-2 and 2-2-2 respectively. 3. Observations are extended to the other Japanese species of this genus, M. todai, which prove the presence of "terminalia" on each of tarsi I and II in opposition to Kamo's original description. On the other hand, it is ratified that the tarsus I is lacking in "parasubterminalia" in M. todai as well as in M. smadeli. 4. In connection with the description of M. smadeli, additional measurement units are proposed here for a previous set of "standard measurements or data of scutum". Those units are devised if possible to clarify the relative positions of scutal setae as follows : AMA-Distance between bases of anteromedian and anterlateral setae AMS-Distance between bases of anteromedian seta and one sensillaly base AMP-Distance between bases of anteromedian and posterolateral setae This work is aided in part through a Grant in Aid for Scientific Research under Cont. No. DA-92-557-FEC-23, 611 between Dr. Takeo Tamiya and Office of the Surgeon General, U.S.A.

N2  - Seasonal prevalence of mosquitoes were studied during the period from June to December, 1951, using three methods (a. Collection of adult invaded houses using exhauster. b. Biting collection using goat and chicken as baits. c. Larval collection around houses) and following results were obtained. 1. 5 genera, 12 species of adult mosquitoes were collected in the houses and Culex pipiens occupied the great majority of the specimens (67.4%). 2. Mosquitoes collected by biting collection using goat as a bait were 4 genera and 7 species and the majority of the specimens were C. tritaeniorhynchns (64.2%). 3. Those of using chicken were 3 genera and 6 species and the majority species were C. pipiens (89.8%). 4. Larval surveys were done in 11 habitats and 2 genera and 5 species were obtained. C. pipiens occupied the great majority of the specimens (97.6%). 5. The peaks of population curves obtained differed with species and collecting methods.

N2  - 1. Cockroaches living in the vessels which entered the port of Kobe were collected over a period of 2 years and 8 months, from April 1953 to November, 1955. 2. Sixkinds of cockroaches were found during the period mentioned above. The species are as follows : Periplaneta americana L., Periplaneta australasiae F., Blattella germanica L., Stylopyga rhombifolia S., Neuphoeta cinerea O., Leucophaea surinamensis L. 3. The number of Blettella germanica L. found dead as the result of HCN-fumigation using for deratting in the vessel was supposed to be the real number of cockroaches living there. 4. 120 vessels were fumigated with HCN and 719, 801 Blattella germanica L. were found dead. 5. Investigation on the incidences of Blattela germanica L. was made each on the seasonal changes of climate (winter-19.13%, spring-28.41%, summer-27.74%, autumn-24.70%), on the classification of compartment (galley-66.94%, pantry & dining-room-17.11%, crew quarters-7.6%, provision store rooms-6.76%, officer's quarters & passenger quarters-1.38%, ) on the description of vessel (cargo boat-42.70%, passenger boat-34.35%, tanker-22.12%), on the age of vessel (within 1 year-3.11%, 1-3 years-23.07%, 3-5 years-27.91%, 5-10 years-16.73%, over 10 years-29.91%), and on the kind of route (Formosan, Okinawa & Korean line-12.53%, North American, European line-30.37%, South-East Asiatic, Middle Near Eastern & African line, Central-South American line-57.09%) 6. This investigation was done on the influence of the last HCN-fumigation effected on Blattella germanica L. (within 6 months-26.32%, 1/2-1 year-34.28%, 1-2 years-24.86%, over 2 years 14.52%).

N2  - 1) It is one of the purposes of the present paper to report the evidence of high level resistance to DDT observed in Japanese houseflies. 2) The large-scale malaria control program in Hikone City, Japan, resulted in such a remarkable success as no patient was reported since 1954. However, DDT resistant houseflies have developed in this city. 3) The result of tests on resistibility of houseflies to DDT and BHC indicates that the field population in this city is consisted of two distinct groups, i. e., the DDT resistant and nonresistant. However, no BHC resistance has developed in this field population. 4) Among the progeny of DDT resistant flies, several morphological mutants have been found. (The full contents of this paper will be translated in English in a publication of World Health Organization, Japanese contributions to the study of insecticide-resistance problem, in press.).

Apanteles conspersae -1) Excepting a few cases, the parasite larva comes out from the body of (n-3)th instar larva of host (the nth instar=the final instar) and pupates on it. 2) The host alives even 17-18 days after the parasite larva escaped from it. 3) The parasitic number per host is from 1 to 11. 4) The parasitic rate is 15% and the emergent rate is 94%. 5) The prepupal and pupal stages were 7-12 days and the adults emerged during the period on May 11. to June 9. 2. Sturmia picta -1) The parasite larva comes out from the body of (n-2)th instar larva of the host and then pupates. 2) The larva of the infested host cocoons in the (n-2)th instar and dies as a result of escape of the parasite 3) The parasitic number per host is one. 4) The parasitic rate is 8% and the emergent rate is 67%. 5) The prepupal and pupal stages are 12-16 days and the adult emerged from May 30. to June 2.

N2  - An ecological study on the compositions of the early stages of black fly associations and their seasonal successions were conducted in Biwataki stream in the suburbs of Tokyo. The observation on fourteen stations in the stream (Fig. 1) was continued from March 1956 to February 1957. The physical characteristics of the stations of the stream is given in Table 1. 2. The aggregate number of studied stations through one year amounted to 119 stations, and on 90 stations of them, the specimens of black flies were found. The species and number collected is given in Table 2. 3. The phenomenon of the spacial habitat segregation in the stream was observed as in Fig. 2. According to the distribution of black flies, Biwataki stream seems to divide into four habitat groups. Namely, the stream is constituted by four zones, which are represented by Simulium bidentatum, S. aokii+S. tuberosum, tub. +S. japonicum and S. subcostatum respectively. And toward the upper part of the stream, five species are arranged in an order of bid., aok., tub., jap. and sub. 4. When the composition of black fly associations was analized, there were 26 types. The types, which amounted the number of collection to above three times, is given in Table 3. 5. If we analize the seasonal prevalence of early stages of black flies in the stream, there were five types showing in Fig. 4. It seemed that tub. is the perennial nucleus, bid. is an vernal-estival, aok. is an estival-autumnal, jap. is an hiemal-vernal and sub. is vernal type respectively. 6. Habitat segregation of early stages of black flies seems to divide into two types. The first type encloses the phenomenon which segregate their habitats as the results of the coaction of each other species. As shown in Fig. 3, bid. is the dominant species occupying 94-100% of the number collected on Station A from April to August, and tub. is the dominant species on the same place during February and March. The two species are equally balanced during October and January. In spring and summer, when bid. occurs on Station A, tub. seems to retrocede toward upper stream, and in winter when bid. is absent, tub. appears at Station A. Moreover, other species seems to shown the second type of habitat segregation which establish the intimate physiological connections to their habitat conditions. 7. Environmental factors concerning the habitat segregation of early stages of black flies were discussed. From point of view based on so-called macro-habitat, the composition of early stages of black flies associations seems to affect mainly by the "Type of Stream" regarded as a complex made of various physical attributes of a stream. The local distribution of habitat of black flies may be determinated mainly by the water temperature, but within a single stream the influence of water temperature may not always be decisive.

N2  - As a part of the quantitative taxonomic studies on the trombiculid mites or Tsutsugamushi of Japan, specimens of Trombicula nagayoi Sasa et al. and the related species collected from three representative districts were measured. The group of mites obviously belongs to the autmnaalis-group, subgenus Neotrombicula, genus Trombicula. Three species have been recorded from Japan, namely Trombicula japonica Tanaka et al., Trombicula nagayoi Sasa et al. and Trombicuia ichikawai Sasa. They could mainly be differentiated by the size of scutum and by the number of dorsal setae rows. As the results of the extensive collections made in these several years at various districts of Japan, groups of specimens showing somewhat intermediate characters have been accumulated. For example, a part of larval specimens of nagayoi collected at Yamanaka were found to have the same dorsal chaetotaxy as that of ichikawai, or those of japonica from Hokkaido showed variations towards the characters in nagayoi. Standard measurements of the scutum (AW, PW, pl) and the classifications of the dorsal chaetotaxy were made with the specimen-groups of questionable taxonomic status. Ecological observations such as the seasonal distributions of larvae and the geographical distributions of each forms, or the comparative morphological studies on the laboratory reared nymphs were also applied to elucidate their specific features. Through these studies, it was almost unequivocally confirmed that the three types represented isolated and independent natural populations, and constituted different species, as were recognized by the original describers. However, it was also shown that they may exhibit different variational ranges in their morphological characters by the localities of collections.

N2  - The knockdown effects of lindane and diazinon on house fly and German cockroach were compared with each other in the forms of kerosene solution, aceton solution or dust using contact and spray tests. In general, the kerosene solution of lidane gave quicker knockdown effect than that of diazinon and, on the contrary, in the form of aceton solution or dust, diazinon proved to give quicker effect than lindane. On the contact tests on house fly, the following results were obtained : The median knockdown time (KT-50) was comparatively longer even in lower concentration of lindane, but of diazinone the KT-50 was rather shorter in lower concentration, or, in other words, the difference of the knockdown effect between the higher and the lower concentrations was smaller in lindane than in diazinon. This seemed to be caused partly by the higher volatility of lindane. From these results, the authors were led to the conclusion that the knockdown effect of chemicals might be estimated differently by using different form of chemicals, different method of application, or different species of test insects. The relationship between dosage and mortality should be persumed to compare the efficacy of chemicals.

N2  - The author has collected three species of fleas from the bodies and the nests of Eurasian small flying-squirrels, Pteromys volans amygdali (Thomas, 1906). They are : 1. Hystrichopsylla microti Scaron, 1950, 2. Rhadinopsylla japonica Sakaguti & Jameson 1956, 3. Monopsyllus argus (Rothschild, 1908). A single specimen of Hystrichopsylla microti was found in the nest but not found on the bodies of mammals. This species has hitherto been found on the wild vole of Microtus montebelli, house rat of Rattus rattus and some insectivora such as Talpa micrura and Urotrichus talpoides. Pteromys volans amygdali seems not the only host of this flea. The last two species, Rhadinopsylla japonica and Monopsyllus argus are found both on the bodies and in the nests of the flying-squirrel, sometimes separately and sometimes together. The former is rather scarce and the latter occurs more abundantly. But both species of fleas are also collected from the bodies and the nests of white-cheeked giant flying-squirrel, Petaurista leucogenys, which is a larger species but has the same habitat as Pteromys volans. Rhadinopsylla japonica is strictly confined to these two flying-squirrels, Monopsyllus argus, however, although found frequently on these two flying-squirrels, also occurs occasionally on a Eurasian squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris together with the allied species, Monopsyllus indages. However, Monopsyllus argus rarely occurs on Martes melampus. Both species of the host, flying-squirrels which are parasitised by both species of fleas, Rhadino-psylla japonica and Monopsyllus argus show closely similar living habits. Sometimes the nest of the small Pteromys volans is occupyed by the large Petaurista leucogenys. It is, therefore, supposed that Pteromys volans amygdali discussed in this paper is the true host of the two species of fleas, Rhadinopsylla jopcnica and Monopsyllus argus, as well as Petaurista leucogenys which is a larger species of Pteromys volans amygdali.

N2  - The bat flea fauna of Japan has not been sufficiently studied. Only two species Ischnopsyllus indicus Jordan, 1931 and I. elongatus (Curtis, 1832) have been reported by Kumada & Saito (1953) and Yamashita & Haga (1954). In the present paper, the third species, Nycteridopsylla galba Dampf, 1910 is reported from Chiba prefecture, central part of Japan, on the body of Oriental Large Noctule, Nyctalus aviator. The species of fles has been described by Dampf (1910) from "bat" of Shanghai and Ischnopsyllus wui, which is synonymous to N. galba, has been reported afterwards by Hsu (1936) from "bat" on Soochow, 60 miles west from Shanghai. The descriptions by Dampf and Hsu, both are based upon the male specimens and the female of the species has not yet been described. Therefore, the writer describe the female sex in this paper. It is thought that a few species of bat fleas have previously been known in Japan, but other species will be added to our native fauna in the future if we examine carefully many specimens of bats from the different parts of Japan.

N2  - Four Geophilids, Prolamnonyx holstii (Pocock) (Geophilomolpha, Mecistocephalidae) were found in the feces excreted by clyster. The infested host was a 6 years old boy and chief symptoms seemed to be caused were slight fever, abdominalgia, headache, vomiting, and discharge of mucous bloody feces. After removal of the parasites, these symptoms recovered and the boy showed good appetite and vitality. The specimens were deposited in the Department of Parasitology, Kurume University School of Medicine.

N2  - One or two percent malathion emulsion with sugar was sprayed in pens and manure heaps, and the effect against the flies was estimated by the change of the population. When 1% emulsion was sprayed in pens at the rate of 80cc per square meter, the population of fly was kept comparatively lower for 4 or 5 days than before the application. But only for 1 or 2 days it was effective by the application of 40cc per square meter. On manure heaps, even the application of 120cc or 240cc of 2% emulsion per square meter did not show distinct decrease of the population of fly.

N2  - We have already outlined a fauna of the ectoparasites of Japanese wood mice (Matsuyama et Ueno, 1955, 1956) : in the present paper the fauna of ectoparasites of the wood mouse, Apodemus speciosus, the wild house mouse, Mus molossimus, and shrew-mole, Urotrichus talpoides, captured during the same survey from July 1954 to June 1955 was described. 1. Five shrew-moles were captured during a period between November 1954 and February 1955. A comparison of their ectoparasites with those of the wood mice captured during same period and the same place is as follows : Trombiculidae : Numerous T. kansai and a single T. kochiensis from shrew-moles. Nine species (containing T. kansai and T. kochiensis) in a considerable numbers of each species from wood mice. Laelaptidae : Only one individual of "Genus B" was collected from shrew-moles, whereas L. jettmari, H. japonicus, and E. stabularis from wood mice. Others : Cheyletidae sp. from shrew-moles, Ixodidae, Haematopinidae, and hypopus of Glycyphagidae from wood mice, each few in numbers. 2. Four wild house mice were captured during a period between Feburuary to April, 1955. A comparison of their ectoparasites with those of the wood mice captured during same period and the same place is as follows : Trombiculidae : From wild house mice, T. fuji, T. kitasatoi, T. daisen, T. kochiensis, T. pallida and T. miyajimai were collected, but T. kansai and G. saduski were not recognized. From wood mice all the species as above were collected. Laelaptidae : From wood mice, L. jettmari, H. japonicus, E. stabularis and "Genus B", whereas even not a single individual of Laelaptidae from wild house mice. Others : Except some hypopus of Glycyphagidae, no mite was found from wild house mice. From wood mice the mites of Ixodidae, hypopus of Glycyphagidae, Haematopinidae, and Cheyletidae were collected. 3. We believe that these differences of the ectoparasites fauna of these three host species due to the difference of the behaviour of each host, or the host selection of the parasites themselves.

N2  - In the present paper, the authors report on the results of field studies on the control of malayan filariasis prevalent among the inhabitants of Hachijo-koshima Island which is located about 360km south of Tokyo. It has been known since old times that a kind of elephantiasis exists in this area, but it was 1951 that the causative parasite was identified as Wuchereria malayi (Brug, 1927) by the authors and their associates. Among the six species of mosquitoes found in this island, Aedes togoi was demonstrated to be naturally infected by the worm and acted as the main vector of the disease, and Culex pipiens pallens was also found to harbour the infective larvae of the parasite in experimental studies. The present study was designed to erradicate the disease from this area both by the treatment of human carriers and by the control of mosquito vectors. The projects started from August 5, 1956 with the examinations of thick blood smears of the inhabitans for the microfilariae. Out of 66 persons 22 or 33.3% were found to be positive. "Supatonin" (diethyl carbamazine compound) was administered to all of the carriers by the ratio of 6mg per kilogram of body weight daily for 14 days. Through previous studies, the drug was certified to be a very effective chemotherapeutic, but to cause febril attacks on the first few days of the course. As for the mosquito control, various measures were adopted simultaneously. DDT residual spray was applied to the total of 25 houses by the ratio of 2g of DDT to 1 square meter of the walls, using water suspension of 40% DDT paste manufactured by Nippon Soda Co. This immediately caused the practical erradication of adult mosquitoes and houseflies from the human dwellings. Breeding places of mosquito larvae were treated in different ways according to the types of water. Concrete rain-water reservoirs were the main source of the vector species, to which a kind of small fresh-water fish, Oryzias latipes (Temminck et Schlegel) carried from Tokyo or naturally bred at Hachijo Island was set free. Through previous experiments, the fish was found to erradicate mosquito larvae from the reservoirs. Miscellaneous water containers scattered in the village were treated by suspensions of DDT paste by the ratio of 1 ppm of DDT to the amount of water. Thousands of rockpools were also found to be scattered along the shore and to harbour large numbers of larvae of Aedes togoi. To this area, DDT dusting by a helicopter Bell-47-G was applied. A total of 180kg of 10% DDT powder was applied to an area of about 80, 000 sqare meters. All of the larvae examined after 24 hours were found to be killed by the insecticide. The island was again surveyed in December of the same year. The radical control of neither the parasite nor the vectors has not yet been attained. It was suggested that repeated applications of such control measures were needed to accomplish the purpose.

N2  - The seasonal prevalence of fleas on Rattus rattus were studied at Fuchu, Tokyo, through consecutive 12 months, from March, 1955, to Feburuary, 1956. The fleas were Nosopsyllus fasciatus, Monopsyllus anisus and Leptopsylla segnis. Xenopsylla cheopis, Paradoxopsyllus curvispinus, Echidnophaga gallinacea and Tunga caecigea were not found during this survey. All the three species showed their top peak of prevalence in May 1955. The fleas are quite seldom during the summer season but after October the flea index gradually increases and showed a second peak in November. Therefore it seems that under the airtemperature between 10℃ and 20℃ the fleas may increase and decrease if the temperature ascend above 20℃.

N2  - 1. The results of the autopsy of mice and rats killed by one or continuous administrations also revealed the frequency of each haemorrhagic lesion observed in the order of lungs, stomach, intestines, heart, thoracic cavity, liver, abdominal cavity, brain, oral cavity, hypodermic lesions, reproductive organs, kidneys and pancreas. 2. The degree of pulmonary haemorrhage with continuous administrations of high dose was larger than the degree of pulmonary haemorrhage with one administration of high dose or continuous admistrations of low dose. 3. In the case the prothrombin time value was less than 300sec., the Benzidin reaction of feces was not always positive but that of urine was negative. In the case, however, the prothrombin time value was more than 300 sec., the Benzidin reaction of feces was positive in all tested mice but that of urine was negative in many mice. 4. In the first stage of warfarin poisoning within 24 hours after the first administration the haematocrit value and the number of erythrocytes increased in some degrees in parallel with prothrombin time value, but both decreased progressively in parallel with the number of administrations and the Benzidin reaction of feces rather than the prothrombin time value, and in the last stage of poisoning the haematocrit value showed about 50 percent (20-80 percent) of the normal value. 5. When haematocrit value became lower than 80 percent of the normal, erythrocyte sedimentation velocity of blood increased considerably independent to the prothrombin time value. But when haematocrit value was higher than 80 percent the normal haematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation velosity of blood did not increase. 6. In the case the prothrombin time value was less than 300 sec., erythrocyte resistance against 0.3-0.5 percent of saline solution and 0.0001-0.1 percent of saponin was normal but when the prothrombin time value was more than 300 sec. a slight decrease of erythrocyte resistance was observed in some mice. The haemolytic action of warfarin was not observed in vitro. 7. In dependent to doses, leucocytes showed the fluctuation of two types as follows : 1) leucocytes of some mice decreased after the increase in the beginning 2) leucocytes of other mice decreased from the beginning of poisoning. And in the last stage of poisoning, leucocytes did not necessarily decrease less than normal value. Eosinophils fluctuated in parallel with prothrombin time value in the first stage of warfarin poisoning but in the last stage of poisoning, it decreased distinguishedly. 8. Blood plateletes showed similar fluctuations as that of leucocytes. 9. Pulmonary capillary resistance decreased distinctively in parallel with the prothrombin time value and the administered doses. And in the case the prothrombin time value was more than 300 sec., a remarkable decrease of pulmonary resistance was observed in the individuals which Benzidin reaction and decrease of erythrocytes were distinguished. In this pulmonary resistance test, capillary resistance of median lobe was most fragile. 10. Skin capillary resistance decreased in parallel with prothrombin time value. 11. Diffusion areas of india ink caused by hyaluronidase in the intracutaneous lesions of poisoned mice was larger than the untreated control.

N2  - To evaluate the effectiveness of chemicals on the acaroid mites, two methods were devised and the effects of several miticides were tested. Ring method : A glass ring 9mm in diameter and 10mm in height was fixed with paste closely on a slide glass on which a piece of filter paper and black blotting paper labeled. In the ring, insecticidal suspension was dropped, and then about 100 mites were released. A cover glass was fixed on the ring with glycerine gelly. After 24 hours or 48 hours, the death rate of the mites was recorded. Petri-dish method : To test the contact effects of miticides, 300 to 500 mites were released on a piece of filter paper soaked with 2 cc of various dilutions of emulsion for 15 minutes. Then, the mites were transfered to anothor petri-dish, which was covered tightly by plastic sheat to prevent the escape of the mites. To test the fumigating effects of chemicals, a piece of filter paper treated by the chemical was hung by a string in deep petri-dish of 6cm in height and 8.5cm in diameter. This was designed to avoid the direct contact of the chemicals with the mites. After 24 hours, the results were recorded. The screening tests of 12 chemicals as the miticides on the acaroid mites, Tyrophagus dimidiatus, were carried out by the petri-dish method. The order of miticidal effect evaluated by the method was as follows; dieldrin>endrin>heptachlor>adrin>lindane, malathion, DDT>chlordane>diazinon>DN. The effects of o-dichlorobenzene and DDT were much lower than the above chemicals. Lindane was proved to be effective to the mites as the fumigant at room temperature (20℃) and as the contact poison, and was recommended in the practical use.

N2  - The residual effects of DDT and dieldrin were observed in three stables and a chicken house in summer of 1956. Interior surface of pens was treated by DDT at the rate of 1g/m^2 or by dieldrin 0.1g/m^2, each three or four times from July to September. In the period the species of mosquitoes observed in the test areas were as follows : Aedes vexans nipponii, Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes albopictus, Armigeres subalbatus and Culex pipiens pallens. The peaks of number of mosquitoes resting on the wall of the stables were 8.00 (A. vexans, C. tritaeniorhynchus) to 10.00p.m. (Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis) and 4.00a.m. (A. v., C. t., An. h. s., ). The mosquitoes resting on the wall in the night time were less in the treated stables than in the untreated ones. In the daytime, no mosquito was observed on the walls treated by the chemicals. But the residual effects of the chemicals observed seem to be lower than those estimated in laboratory.

N2  - The effects of dieldrin emulsion to Sarcophaga peregrina were studied by treating them in larval stage, comparing with that of lindane emulsion. The mortalities of larvae after 24, 48 hours, and those in the total larval stage and in larval and pupal stages, were obtained by treating the 3 rd instar larvae through the rice-husks immersion method, thus obtaining the retarded lethal effect of the chemicals. The lethal efficacy of concentration-mortality regression equation was lower in dieldrin than in that of lindane. The ratio of LC-50 of dieldrin to that of lindance were 1.6 for the larval mortality after 24 hours, 1.9 for after 48 hours, 2.0 for the mortality in total larval stage, and 9.7 for that in larval and pupal stages, so that it was concluded that the retarded lethal effect of dieldrin was higher than that of lindane. It was also recognized that the application of dieldrin or lindane to the larvae would tend to promote their emerging time, though the degree of the promotion was not so remarkable. The number of the flies emerged in the night time was greater than in the daytime, both in the treated and in the untreated by the chemical.

N2  - Dieldrin solution with different solvent was dropped on house flies by a microsyringe, and the insecticidal effects were compared with each other. It was recognized that there exsisted significant difference among the insecticidal efficacy of those solutions, and also exsisted positive corelation between the boiling points of the solvents and the insecticidal efficacy of the solutions.

N2  - The eradication of the cockroaches established in the ships sailing home and abroad is a great concern for the sanitary officers. The result of a survey practised for about two years at Kobe herbour, of the species of the cockroaches taken from 28 steamboats was presented in this paper. The material, each a small example of cockroaches collected by fumigation has been sent for identification to our laboratory. The most prevailing species was the German roach, Blattella germanica, being found in 23 ships; the other two species, the American roach, Periplaneta americana, and our common black roach, P. fuliginosa were taken in five and four cases respectively.

N2  - Rearing of Simuliid larvae in the laboratory is said to be very difficult, for the need of special breeding environment, and a few authors succeeded it : Puri (1925) reared artificially S. aureum and S. erythrocephalum from eggs to adults in the laboratory and Mackerras (1948), too, succeeded in the rearing of S. ornatipes, but no report in Japan : We have attempted it in Japanese species. For the purpose of artificial breeding of the black fly, we constructed a simple and inexpensive rearing apparatus utilising a water current aspirator (see Fig. 1, 2, 3) and succeeded to rear S. (W.) salopiense from eggs to adults in the laboratory with this apparatus. This rearing investigation was done from June to July in 1956 at Kyoto Prefectural Medical University. Rearing aquaria (volum; ca. 500cc) were filled nearly with underground water (chemical analysis is shown in Table 1). Simulium eggs were put in it with some leaves of spinach as larval food. The water and food were changed once or twice in a week, and the temperature of aquaria was kept between 16-17℃. It was bobbling continuously. According to our observations, the duration of larval life of S. (W.) salopiense was 32-47 days and pupal life 2-6 days. Adults thus reared, showed same ratio in male and female approximately (see Fig 4), and attained a normalsize. Further high instar larvae of S. (W.) salopiense and S. (O.) aokii were collected from the natural breeding stream and they were put in the above rearing aquaria; 14.7, 31.1 and 35.6% of them pupated after 24, 48 and 72 hours respectively, but mortality also increased as 0.7, 10.5 and 46.7% respectively (see Table 2). These results, the artificial breeding from eggs and the feeding of high instar larvae, suggest that the larvae which developed to a certain extent in their natural breeding stream can hardly adapt themselves to the new environment of rearing aquaria, while the larvae hatched in the aquaria from the start, can develope better. We could not find any differences in result between underground water and stream water as the rearing water, but if the bobbling was not attempted, any larvae could not pupate and all of them died soon (within 72 hours) (see Table 3). It seems to be unnecessary to change water frequently in the case enough vegetables were bestowed as food. Optimal temperature of water current, plenty of oxygen and food may be all that are essential for the growth of Simulium larvae.

N2  - In the present study an analytical examination was made of the influence of relative humidity on the activity of Oncomelania nosophora. The experiment was conducted in a perfect dark room during the spring and summer months of 1956. The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 1. The snail is amphibious living in an irrigation ditch, in a moist grassland on the beach of a large river, or, in rare cases, in rice field. It appears from its habit as if the snail depends for its activity more or less on the relative humidity of the environment it lives in. However, the experiments showed that the snails were not invariably active when the relative humidity was high (97-100%), and that they were active, irrespective of a change in the relative humidity to some extent, so long as the touched surface of the shell was wet. It may be assumed that in nature the activity of the snail is arrested for want of moisture and is resumed as the touched surface of its shell becomes wet with rain or dew.

N2  - In 1955, with the assistance of 16 health centers in Niigata Prefecture, flies of medical importance were collected by means of a cage or ribbon trap throughout the year. They totalled 30, 751 specimens consisting of 18, 181 outdoor flies (15, 308, collected in an open field, plus 2, 873, trapped in such mountain areas as Kushigatayama, Ginzan-daira and Oze) and 12, 570 indoor ones. As shown in the classification table, they were classified into 10 families, 32 genera and 61 species. To describe the fly fauna, in family Muscidae, Muscina angustifrons held a superiority in every region. In family Anthomyiidae, both Fannia and Qphyra species were omnipresent, while Ophyra nigra was distributed more densely in a piedmont rather than in a plain. In Greenbottle flies of family Calliphoridae, Phaenica sericata ranked first in inhabitation number in most of the regions. A distribution of P. sericata >Lucilia illustris>L. caesar was observed in most of the region and that of P. sericata>L. caesar>L. illustris in some districts. An uncommon distribution of L. caesar>P. sericata was seen in Sanjo and Koide districts, that of P. sericata>L. caesar>P. cuprina, L. illustris in Niitsu district, and that of P. sericata>L. caesar>Hemipyrelia ligurriens>L. illustris in Sado Island. And L. papuensis, which is usually seen in a mountain area only, inhabited as a common species in Sado Island. Phormia regina and Protophormia terae-novae were found to inhibit in Naoetsu district. This may be of some help in the investigations of such an epidemic as polio. Of Sarcophagid flies, 14 species were discovered in Niigata Prefecture and showed a distribution of Sarcophaga peregrina>S. melanura>S. similis common to every district. It was interesting that S. tsushimae was discovered in Sado Island as well as in Tsushima, and S. polystylata originally discovered in Peiping was found out in a coastal plain along the Japan Sea. Concerning the fauna of indoor flies trapped by a ribbon, a distribution of Musca domestica>Fannia canicularis type was seen in some districts and that of the reverse type in others. Other species of flies were also found in small numbers. It, therefore, followed that many species of flies would invade indoors. Generally most of the flies of medical importance made three appearance in large numbers in spring, summer and autumn. Some species of family Calliphoridae, for instance, Calliphorinii, made their appearance in spring and autumn, and hid themselves in summer while Lucilia species are very common chiefly in summer, as flies of Sarcophagid flies did. Scopeuma stercorarium and Stenodryomyza formosa appears in early spring and late autumn, while Helomyza modesta in late autumn and early winter. Any summer mountains abunded with flies, but a fly fauna in them was fairly different from that in a plain. To enter into details, in both Kushigata-yama and Ginzan-daira, Chrysomya pinguis predominated in numbers; P. sericata hardly made its appearance; L. caesar was relatively numerous; L. papuensis was active as a common species in a mountain as its name suggests, and Calliphora lata and Aldrichina grahami, which, in a plain, do not usually make their appearance during summer, led an active life. Of family Muscidae, Muscina angustifrons was seen most frequently as a common species in a mountain region, and also M. assimilis and M. pabulorum were found easily. Of family Anthomyiidae, Ophyra nigra was distributed comparatively densely, and Hylemyia platura, which is distributed all over the country, was also discovered in the mountain areas. Scopeuma stercorarium and Stenodryomyza formosa were not trapped in those places. As for Sarcophagid flies, a distribution of S. peregrina>S. melanura>S. similis commonly observable in a plain, did not stand for the mountain areas, that is, a distribution of S. peregrina>S. albiceps>S. similis>S. melanura was seen in Kushigata-yama, that of S. similis>S. peregrina>S. albiceps>S. melanura>S. harpax in Ginzan-daira, and that of S. similis>S. albiceps in Oze. In these districts, so many species of flies as those in the plains were not discovered, and S. similis, S. albiceps and S. melanura each made their appearances in nearly the same number as that of S. peregrina. It was worthy of notice that two kinds of eye-flies, i. e., Stegana sp. and Amiota variegata, were discovered in Ginzan-daira and Oku-Nikko. We not pass this fact unnoticed from the standpoints of labour and prevention of an Eye-Disease.

N2  - Bats (Pipistrellus abramus) were artificially reared on a bait of water and flies of medical importance. 1) Bats captured alive in spring were very poor in vitality and could only survive for ten or more days on that bait. 2) Of bats captured alive in summer and early autumn, about 80% maintained their existence until the next spring, and some could survive for more than one year on the bait. 3) The rearing of female bats was more difficult than that of male ones. 4) The propagation of bats ended in failure by this method of rearing. 5) The most unfavorable factor in the artificial rearing of bats was found to be an anaemia by blood-sucking ectoparasites.

N2  - In the present paper, results of the experimental studies on the growth of the sugar mite, Carpoglyphus lactis (Linnaeus) under various environmental conditions are presented. The mite has been known to breed abundantly in sugar and in "miso" (fermented bean paste) in Japan, and has called attention as the economic and sanitary pest in these several years. Among various sugar samples in the market, the mite was demonstrated to breed only in crude surgar called as "black", "san-on" and "chujiro", but not in refined sugar. Under optimum temperature and humidity, the number of mites recovered from 1 gram of such crude sugar attained up to 900 after about a month of culture. The humidity requirements of the mite under adequate temperature and food were investigated by cultivating them in "san-on" at 25℃ in glass vials. The humidity in each vial was conditioned by using saturated solutions of KNO_3 (about 92% R. H.), KCl (about 84% R. H.), NaCl (about 75% R. H.), K_2CO_3 (about 42% R. H.) and by water (about 100% R. H.). The breedings of the mite in the sugar were seen only in the vials containing saturated solution of NaCl. In those with higher humidities, the sugar soon began to ferment and resulted in the death of the mites in a few weeks. Under lower humidities, the mites died in a few days by desiccation. The relationship between temperature and the growth of the mite populations was also investigated. At 37℃, the mite seemed to die in a few days. At 28℃, the increase of the mite population was found to in the optimum condition, attaining up to 900 per gram of sugar after 40 days of cultivation. The population density declined rapidly thereafter, when the mite consumed the nutration. At lower temperatures of 25℃, 20℃ or 15℃, the increase of the mite population occurred slower, and the level of the maximum growth density was found to be lower, but the growth of the mites in the sugar sample lasted for longer periods. The construction of the mite populations was analysed by counting the ratio of developmental stages in the life cycle of the mite under various conditions. In earlier stages of the growth, the percentage of larva exceeded those of the other stages, thus showing that the populations were "young." In later phases of cultivations, the ratio of deutonymph increased with the decline of the population densities.

N2  - In this paper, we report on the outline of the ectoparasites of the wood mice, Apodemus speciosus, according to the field survey of KARAO-valley, HIROKAWA-cho, ARITA-gun, WAKAYAMA-ken, Japan, from July 1954 to June 1955. Chiefly, we deal in the seasonal fluctuations of each species and their interrelationship. We collected the considerable numbers of species, but as a part of this survey, we already reported on the chigger mites, Trombiculidae, so we don't describe in detail on each species of the chigger mites. The results are as follows; I. Taxonomical data : following species were collected (see Table I) Trombiculidae 2 genera, 9 species. (already reported 1955) Laelaptidae 4 genera, 4 species. Laelaps jettmari, Genus B (Asanuma 1955), Haemogamasus japonicus, Eulaelaps stabularis. Ixodidae 1 genus, 3 species. Ixodes sp.2, sp.6, sp.54 (Asanuma 1952, 1953.) Glycyphagidae sp. hypopal stage. Cheyletidae sp. Dermoglyphidae sp. Haematopinidae 2 genera, 2 species. Polyplax serrata, Hoplopleura akanezumi. II. Seasonal fluctuations 1. Trombiculidae group As a family, the most influent group in autumn, winter and spring, but decrease in numbers of species and collected specimens in summer. 2. Laelaptidae group Without L. jettmari, other three species are few. L. jettmari is the most influent species in summer, but in other seasons scarce. Except larvae, all stages of L. jettmari can be collected in every season, but female adults deposit always highly in percentage, male adults and deutonymphs lowly except in summer, and protonymphs always keep on about 20%. 3. Ixodidae group Can be collected few throughut one year. 4. Glycyphagidae group From spring to summer considerably increase in numbers, but in other seasons scarce. 5. Dermoglyphidae group Collected from only two hosts which trapped at July and August. 6. Cheyletidae group few. 7. Haematopinidae group Both species collected considerably in summer, but in other seasons few. III. For one group, abundance or scarce in numbers of the other groups effect neither attractive nor repellent. IV. The sexuality of hosts is not significant for the population numbers of the exoparasite.

N2  - 1. Little has been known of the Japanese psocid insects as stored products pest, although the names of ca. 104 psocid species have been enumerated by taxonomists. 2. In the general part of the present paper is described an account of the family Liposcelidae and of the genus Liposcelis, together with an outline of the order Psocoptera and the other major representatives of the psocid insects as household pest. 3. Based upon the specimens collected in Japan, the taxonomic characters, the life history, the bionomics and the habitats of Liposcelis bostrychophilus, one of these psocids, are recorded. It was indicated, that the preoviposition period was 2 to 7 days, the incubation period and the duration of nymphal instars were each 9 to 13 days; the average length from egg to adult was about 20 days, if the temperature, the humidity and the used food were favourable. 4. A comparison of the morphological dfferences was made between the specimens from England and those from several places of Japan (Table I, II).

N2  - The studies on the control of blackflies or Simuliidae were carried out in Myoko Mountain Area, a part of the National Park of North Honshu. Fifty percent DDT wettable powder and 40% DDT paste containing 1.6% lindane were used in these experiments. The larvae of Simulium aokii and S. uchidai were found to be erradicated for the distances of 800 to 1, 000 meters along the stream when 1.2ppm of DDT was applied for 10 minutes. The time required for the detachment of larvae from their habitats were found to be shorter in the cases of DDT paste, and was correlated with amount of DDT applied. Third and 4th stage larvae of S. aokii resisted for longer periods to the insecticide than in younger or older stages. Larvae of S. japonicum were found to be more resistant than other species. A total of 11 species of Simuliidae were collected from this area. Their areal and seasonal distributions were observed through extensive surveys made over a year's period. The control of blackflies was made on the resort area of 24 square kilometers covering about 50 streams which bred the larvae. DDT paste and wettable powder were applied to the streams by the ratio of 10ppm of the effective agents against the water amount flowing in a minute. The applications of the insecticides were made by the interval of a month, seven times from May to December. A total of about 76kg of paste and 4.8kg of wettable powder was consumed during this period. Remarkable decrease of the larvae as well as the adults of blackflies could be attained through these control works. Almost all of the streams running through this area became free from larvae, and the damages caused by the biting of adults in the summer season were found to be much lower than in the preceding year.

N2  - 1. From the determined results of prothrombin time of its mixtures that constant volume (0.1cc) of prothrombin was added an equal volume of labile factor progressively diluted with saline, diluted labile factor more than 12.5% not showed almost prothrombin conversion factor accelerated action. 2. When 0.1cc of prothrombin was mixed with 0.03-0.90cc of labile factor, in the case of the mixture of both equal volumes the prothrombin time showed shortest value. 3. When diluted prothrombin (with saline) was mixed with an equal volume of labile factor, clot forming of its mixtures was exceedinglv bad. Moreover, when normal plasma was diluted with labile factor, the prothrombin time was prolonged progressively according as the increase of the dilution rates. Also, the activity of labile factor in serum almost diminished. 4. When 10% plasma (0.1cc) diluted with saline was mixed with an equal volume of diluted labile factor (5-50% with saline), the prothrombin time showed the constant value until labile factor is diluted 40%. But in the case of more than 30% diluted labile factor, the prothrombin time prolonged more than the constant value. Accordingly, the limitation concentration of labile factor in mice is between 30 and 40%. 5. In poisoned mice which the prothrombin time prolonged less than 300sec., labile factor dose not almost affected by coumarin rodenticides (Warfarin, Neo Cumaran, Pival, Fumarin). But some poisoned mice which the prothrombin time prolonged more than 300sec. indicated the slight decreases of labile factor. 6. In poisoned mice (Warfarin), serum prothrombin consumption was normal. 7. There was a tendency that the activity of stable factor was more or less decreased according as the prolongation of the prothrombin time by Warfarin. 8. In poisoned mice caused by Yellow Phosphorus and Chloroform, in the first stage of poisoning the prothrombin time prolonged and this prolongation of the prothrombin time caused by the decreases of prothrombin, labile factor and stable factor.

N2  - 1. The durations of death day in mice caused by Warfarin is 1-17 days and after the administration of 4-8 doses every 24 hour continuously, 70% of tested mice died. 2. In 18-48 hours after one administration of Warfarin (2.5mg), prothrombin time prolonged the greatest (24 hours : 39/41, 36 hours : 2/41) and prolonged prothrombin time recovered the normal value in 48-96 hours after administration of Warfarin (48 hours : 12/41, 72 hours : 18/41, 96 hours : 10/41). 3. When Warfarin (0.25mg) was given every 24 hour continuously (3-6), the fluctuation of the prothrombin time can be divided three types as follows : 1) the I type (71/92) that prothrombin time prolongs progressively and prolongs more than 300sec., 2) the II types (7/92) that prothrombin time does not prolong remarkably in the case of administrations of 8-15 doses continuously every 24 hour, 3) the III type (14/92) that in the first stage prothrombin time prolongs in some degrees but afterward prothrombin time reduces and again prolongs remarkably more than 300sec.. 4. V. K_3 (0.5-5mg), V. K_4 (0.5-4mg), V. P (1mg), V. C (2mg), V. P (1-2mg)+V. C (2.5-4mg), V. P (1mg)+V. C (2.5mg)+V. K_3 (2mg), Chlorophyll (0.5-1mg), Methionine (2mg), Nicotin Amide (5mg), Glucuronic Acid (5-10mg), and Na-Salicylic Acid (1-20mg) did not exert an antagonistic effect toward the prothrombin reducing action of Warfarin in mice and its death days was same with administration of Warfarin singly. But from the results of autopsy, haemorrhagic degrees in mice given these antidotes lowered somewhat than control (Warfarin singly).

N2  - The author made three years' studies on trombiculid mites and Tsutsugamushi disease of Hachijo Island, about 350km south of Tokyo. A total of 10 species of the mites were recovered from this island, and their seasonal and areal distributions were investigated. Two species were found to be epidemiologically important. Trombicula scutellaris which appears in winter and probably transmits Shichito-type Tsutsugamushi disease prevalent in this area, and Trombicula wichmanni which appears in summer and causes severe itches. Tsutsugamushi disease in this island was also investigated from clinical as well as from epidemiological points of view. This was characterised with its appearance in the winter season and with the extremely low mortality, differing from that in the classical endemic foci of northwest Honshu.

N2  - The work here reported concerns Tabanids taken in catches made during the period 1953-55, mainly in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Tabanidae collected are 5 species of Pangoniinae and 12 species of Tabaninae. Tabanus iyoensis Shiraki has been prevalent along the mountain streams, where the working men are frequently attacked by the swarm of this horse-fly during the summer. On the other hand, T. mandarinus Schiner is very common along the foot of hills and the most violent bloodsucker of cattle. Tabanus rufldens, T. chrysurus and T. sapporoensis have been widely found in the hilly countries, while T. horvathi recorded in the plains only. Biting collections of T. iyoensis have shown that its main biting activity begins before sunset and reaches a distinct peak at dusk, thereafter the number taken diminish rapidly.

N2  - Since the outbreak of Tsutsugamushi disease among the American troops in the fall of 1948, Mt. Fuji Area has called attention of the scientists and a number of works have been made on the trombiculid fauna of this area. In the present paper, the authors present the results of a whole year study on the seasonal and host distributions of the mites at two different stations on the northern slope, where have so far been made under ecological and epidemiological points of view. As the results of the monthly collections from December, 1954 to December, 1955 at Oshino Iriguchi (C-Area) about 900m high and at Kagosaka (D-Area) about 1104m high, a total of 5, 915 larval trombiculid mites classified into 14 species were collected from 193 small mammal hosts belonging to 5 species of rodents or insectivores, as are shown in the tables 2 to 4. The host-parasite relationships are presented in tables 5 and 6, and the monthly distributions of each species are as in figure 2. It should be noted here that trombiculid fauna of areas C and D exhibit remarkable divergencies (Table 5). Species like kit, fuji or mz were found exclusively in C, whereas such species as int, pall, palp and nag were collected mainly in D. The fauna of the latter area was similar to that of northern Japan or of Hokkaido, whereas the former represented the common features to other low-land forest areas of Honshu. The seasonal distributions of each species of Tsutsugamushi were observed by the monthly collection records expressed as Tsutsugamushi index or mean number of the mites found on th host. Nag was found exclusively in the summer, and palp in the winter season : fuji were collected in the seasons through autumn, winter and summer, whereas kit were distributed from spring, summer to winter and int in the long periods except for May and June with its peak in September : jap was definitely a autumn species attaining its maximum in September, and the appearance of mit was observed in later season around December. The host distributions of the mites also exhibited notable differences by species. As the total, Microtus montebelli and Antelicmys smithii or the members of Microtinae harboured more mites than Apodemus speciosus and the parasite index of Apodemus geisha or Urotrichus talpoides was found to be extremely low. Species like palp, int, kit, mz, Gsa or nag were found to show preferences to the former two species, but no essential differences were seen in fuji or mz and in the case of jap higher index were observed on Ap. spec. than in Micr. or Ant. Three of the species, him, mit, Pha were again demonstrated to prefer Urotrichus as their host. The remarkable differences demonstrated here in the areal, seasonal or host distributions of each species of the mites are, however, not simply caused by the influences of a single facter, but should be interpreted as the results of the composition of these and other effects. The matter of chance or error caused by the uneven distributions of the mites and the hosts on the soil surface should also be taken into consideration. In these types of works, a careful analysis of each effects is required before a conclusion drawn.

N2  - Whilst engaged in the rearing of the tea tussock-moth, Euproctis pseudoconspersa Strand, the following facts were observed and appeared to be worth noting : 1. This species breeds twice a year in Japan, but under a constant temperature, 22-25℃, it can be bred successively throughout the year under captivity. 2. Eggs are laid in batches, each contains about 120 eggs. The diameter of the egg 0.6-0.7mm, the duration of the egg development 20-22 days under above mentioned condition. 3. The number of the larval instars is usually 6-7, often 8, 9, or 10. the duration of the larval period was 46 days in average. 4. The prepupal stage takes 2 days, the pupal stage 18-23 days. The male insect pupates and emerges about two or three days prior to that of the female. 5. The length of the survival of the adult insects was 5-7 days : pairing takes place within 24 hours and in an advanced case the oviposition was observed within two days after emergence. 6. The first instar larva has no urticating spicules excepting a few ones transmitted from the egg covering. In the second instar the larva is provided with the spicule bundles on the first and second abdominal segments, each pair is arranged on the subdorsal line. Another bundles appear in the penultimate instar on the eighth segment, and in the ultimate instar there are spicule bundles throughout from the first to the eighth segment, and further each on the lateral lines. The length of an urticating spicule is from 0.03 to 0.207mm, it becomes longer in a later instar. 7. Inside the cocoon there is a brownish circular band at its anterior one third. This band is composed of numerous urticating spicules, and is more distinct of a female insect. The female moth emerges out carrying the spicules on her abdominal tuft hairs. 8. The larvae show a very strong gregarious habit. The length of the larval period as well as the number of the ecdysis seems to be evidently increased by the decrease of the number of the caterpillers fed together. 9. In the final instar the size of the larvae, as measured by the cranium, does not differ regardless the number of the ecdysis.

N2  - Technical DDT is known to be a mixture of more than ten other compounds such as p, p'-DDT, o, p'-DDT, etc., and it is believed that p, p'-DDT is most effective for various pests than any other related compounds. It has also been decided by the WHO Expert Committee of Insecticides that the content of the p, p' isomer shall not be less than 70 per cent by weight. During a series of experiments as regard the efficacy of DDT and its related compounds using resistant as well as non-resistant strains of house-fly and human body louse the present author found the following rather remarkable facts. 1. p, p'-DDT was slightly more toxic than o, p'-DDT to house-fly and to the susceptible strain of body louse, but was less effective than o, p'-DDT to the resistant strains of body louse. 2. Pure p, p'-DDT did not kill our resistant strains of house-fly as well as the resistant strains of body louse, whereas the technical DDT containing only 76.5-82.4 per cent p, p-' isomer kills both resistant and non-resistant strains. 3. A synergistic effect can be assumed when p, p'-DDT is applied in a mixture with, o, p'-DDT, or any other related compound. 4. The waste part of DDT production, which is viscous liquid and contains up to only 32% p, p'-isomrs was revealed to be much more effective than pure p, p'-DDT against resistant and non-resistant test-insects. The native Hikone-strains of house-fly which is known to be strongly resistant to p, p'-DDT can be readily killed in laboratory by the waste material of DDT. 5. Thus, it can be said that so far at least our resistatant and non-resistant strains of house-fly and body louse are concerned there is no positive correlation between the efficacy and the amont of p, p' isomer in technical DDT.

N2  - 1. Several species, which are presumed to be aberrant form (flavism) of Prosimulium yezoense Shiraki, 1935, were collected together with normal individuals at the mountains on Nagano and Yamanasi Pref., Japan. 2. This species was named P. yezoense ab. alpium n. ab.. 3. P. yezoense is a typical mountain breeding species in Japan. The early stages are found in swift mountain streams, and the adults attack man and animal from March to July. 4. The aberrant form is distinguished in the following points from the normal form : (a.) Antenna is blackish brown, with basal two segments and basal half of the third segment is yellowish brown. The latter is black. (b.) Mesonotum, pleurae, scutellum and basal scale is yellow or yellowish brown, with the bright golden pubescence or hairs. The latter is black, with the bright golden pubescence or hairs. (c.) Abdomen is yellowish brown, and becomes blackish brown gradually to posterior end. The latter is blackish brown or black.

N2  - There has been very scanty findings about the natural infection of mosquitoes with Wuchereria bancrofti which are accountable for the role of the mosquitoes found in an area playing upon the dissemination of filariasis. To inquire into the above subject, the author dissected in search of filariae all the mosquitoes collected from 15 filarious villages by different methods described below. I. 14 catches were made early in the morning within the mosquito-net where at least one microfilaria carrier sleeped. II. 47 catches were made early in the morning inside of infested households, and one in a house which is just close to infested ones. III. 34 catches were made at night for about 30 minutes from 8-10 p.m. when the mosquitoes entered infested houses to bite the inmates. IV. 11 out of 16 catches were made at night by human-baited-trap being set up at the front-yard of infested households, while two catches in village No.26, each one in villages Nos. 21, 22 and 23 were made setting up the trap at school yard locating at 300-500m distance from infested households. V. 19 catches in cow-sheds. 2 in goat-sheds were made at night for about 20 minutes from 7-11 p.m.. These cattle-sheds were connected with or just close to the houses having carriers, excepting two cases in which the cow-sheds were at about 500m from an infested village. Another 3 catches were made by goat-baited-trap at night in the front-yard of infested households. VI. One catch (five females of C. pipiens pallens) was made inside of a cave which is apart by 150m from an infested households. The numbers of mosquitoes collected at these villages showing a variation of microfilarial incidence, with those harboring filariae are tabulated in Table 1. The total numbers of individuals of 15 species collected and dissected and the natural infection rates of them are given in Table 2, together with the findings on the suitability of them summarized from the data of Mochizuki (1913), Hu (1940), Yamada (1927) and Omori (1952, 53, 54). The full account of the natural infection of C. pipiens pallens collected by different methods are indicated in Table 3. In Table 4, the inferable developmental stages of filarial larvae in mosquitoes at the time of capture and the dates on supposition of having taken infective meal are given, which are taken from that whether the mosquitoes were engorged with blood or unfed when captured and from the advance in development during the elapsed days from capture to dissection supposing that the larvae have just reached the stage found at the time of dissection according to the temperature condition of the days. The feeding habits of mosquitoes captured in the areas are illustrated in Fig.1. The seasonal distribution of natural infection rate of C. pipiens pallens is illustrated in Fig.2. From these tables and figures the general results are summarized as follows. 1) This is a report dealing with the result of examination on the natural infection of mosquitoes collected by various methods during from 1951 to 1954 at 15 filarious villages in Western Kyushu, Japan. 2) Of 15 species of mosquitoes collected in human dwellings or by human-baited-trap and in cattle-sheds, or by goat-trap at or near infested households, two species, Culex pipiens pallens and Aedes togoi were only found infected with filariae (Table 1 & 2). 3) C. pipiens pallens is the most predominant and is fond of humans to feed (Fig.1) and moreover its natural infection rate is the highest, thus showing that this species is the most dangerous in these districts. A. togoi is common especially in villages located in rocky coastal region but the number of its comming into houses or cattle-sheds is rather less numerous than the next predominant several species and is no more attracted to humans than to cattles and is very low in the natural infection rate (an infected female was captured early in the morning at the inside of a house having two carriers). Therefore this mosquito must be accepted to be a minor important species in spite of the high experimental infection rates having been reported by the other authors. 4) The other species of mosquitoes were negative in natural infection. However, the following species may come into question as they proved to be suitable, though a little, for filariae to mature. A. hyrcanus sinensis and C. tritaeniorhynchus are rather fond of feeding on cattle. C. vishnui appears to be fond of humans especially in foot-hill region. C. bitaeniorhynchus and C. sinensis are rather rare in houses or cattle-sheds. C. pallidothorax is commonly found in larval stage in Western Kyushu but the adults rarely enter houses and don't seem to feed on humans. These mosquitoes must be investigated futhermore on their experimental and natural infection rate in future. 5) It is of interest to find out that the nearer is the site of the mosquito (C. pipiens pallens) being captured to the sleeping quarter of microfilaria carrier, the higher is the rate of natural infection in them (Table 3). Among the infection rates obtained by the different methods of examination, significant differences are obtained by about 4% level. 6) Although the number of filariae found in a pallens female is small and the number of the mosquitoes harboring infective stage larvae in nature is apparently very few, it is noteworthy that the infected females appear to be liable to visit habitually the same or nearby houses to bite humans after spending several days in the very close vicinity of the houses where they took their preceding infective blood meal. Natural infection rate of this mosquito is significantly the highest in August, next highest in September, while it is low in July and the rate is zero in the other months. 7) In filarious villages in Western Kyushu, the most important vector of the disease is bound to be Culex pipiens pallens, judging from its highest suitability to filariae and from its feeding and house-frequenting habits (cf. the last 3 columns in Table 4) as described above. Indeed, it is domestic in hahits breeding in close vicinity of households, feeding preferably on humans and hiding in bush, thicket or wood and whereby surrounded houses, barns and cattle-sheds. The above seems to be accountable for such states of distribution of filariasis in the area having been examined, that the family infections are usually high, the infested houses are often found in groups and the filarial incidences often vary markedly even among just nearby villages.

N2  - Observations were conducted on the seasonal incidence of biting midges, which flew into light traps in the barns of this laboratory, and on the nematodes were detected from their bodies, from June 1954 to July 1955, at Kodaira, in the suburb of Tokyo. Seven species of Culicoides were collected. Of these, C. sigaensis, C. oxystoma and C. arakawae are known but C. odibilis is unknown in Japan, and the rest were new species. The new species will be described in the near future by Dr. M. Tokunaga as C. nipponense (C. sp. II) and C. kitaokai (C. sp. III). The prevalence of these species are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. In 1954, C. sigaensis was exceedingly dominant, C. oxystoma, C. arakawae were next in numbers and other species were rare. In 1955, the constitution of the species populations differed from that of the preceding year and C. oxystoma was the most dominant in August and C. sp. II was common. Engorgement of these biting midges was observed only in C. sigaensis, C. oxystoma, and C. sp. II. A parallelism between the percentage of blood sucking of the biting midges and the number collected was not noticed, but a correlation between the ratios of blood sucking of C. sigaensis and C. oxystoma was significant. A microfilaria-like nematode (0.31%) was found in the engorged C. sigaensis, but two types of nematode (2.2%) were found in a larger percentage from the non-sucking ones. The microfilaria-like nematode may be the microfilaria of Onchocerca cervicalis, but further studies and observations will be necessary to make any conclusion. The writers would regard C. sigaensis as an unsuitable intermediate host for O. cervicalis based on these results.

N2  - Mass rearing of Tyrophagus dimidiatus under the laboratory condition has been succeeded by the author and during his studies on the relations of breeding or longevity to environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, some new notes were observed. These notes are summarized as follows : 1. Relations between breeding and temperature or humidity were studied using chocolate, cheese, and rice as food of mites. The most suitable relative humidity range is 75 to 84% under 25℃. The range is thus limited, even taking differences of results obtained by state or water contents of foods into consideration. 2. The results obtained by the experiment using microscopic-heater and thermo-couple shows that the resistance of the mites against high temperature is relatively weak, i. e. temperature range over 35℃ is fatal and temperature of 47° and of 50℃ kills them immediately. 3. Influences of low temperature were observed on breeding rate and longevity. Neither breeding nor activity are observed under 1° to 5℃, 76% R. H., and survival rate after 5 weeks is 25% and 67.6% of those are deutonymphs. Thus resistance of deutonymph against low temperature is remarkablly strong and this stage may be suitable one overwintering of this mite. 4. Experiment using glass capillary with several saturated salts in both ends to keep several humidity needed was carried out. The results show that most of mites chooses 75 to 80% R. H. 5. From the result obtained by the observations on breeding and development stages using cheese as food under 75 R. H., the phenomena in which colony under new environment increased in number of young stages after 3 weeks, formed matured colony after 25 days. reached under equivalent state after one month, and then gradually became infirm were observed. 6. Weight of one gram matured colony contains 104, 947 individuals.

N2  - 1) Simulium (Gnus) nacojapi is the most predominant species in the northern suburbs of Kyoto-city and this species bites chiefly men and domestic animals violently. 2) The biting collections of S. (G.) nacojapi that attacked on human, cattle and goat were carried out in August and September, 1955, and the relations between the diurnal rhythm of biting activity of this species and the meteorological factors were observed. After the observations it was known that the biting activity of this black fly is influenced by illumination chiefly, while the air temperature and wind velocity were favorable usually all day long during the observations. 3) The optimum intensity of illumination seemed to lie between 1, 000 to 20, 000 lux in this species, but not a few flies were active even under the direct sunshine of midsummer (more over 100, 000 lux).

N2  - 1) It has been already known, as an actual phenomenon, that the residual effectiveness of insecticide is influenced by the kind of surface to which it is applied. In this paper, the relationship between the nature of applied surface and the persistence of residue was investigated under laboratory condition using house fly. 2) The amount of residue was considered from knockdown percentage of the test insect exposed for a certain period to the residue, at intervals up to one year after preparation. 3) The general tendency of insecticide persistence is as follows : γ-BHC : drawing paper>concrete plate>non lacquered veneer plate>glass plate DDT : glass plate>non lacquered veneer plate>drawing paper>concrete plate mixed insecticide DDT+γ-BHC : shows no recognizable difference of persistence 4) The difference of persistence due to the formulation of insecticide in each surface was shown in the following approximate sequence : suspension>emulsion>oil solution 5) A consideration of the above mentioned tendency was given.

N2  - The effects of the mixed emulsion of 50% o-dichlorobenzene and 10%, 7.5%, 5% or 2.5% lindane against 3rd instar larvae of Sarcophaga peregrina R. D. were examined comparing with those of the sole emulsion of 10% lindane or of 50% o-dichlorobenzene. The retarded lethal effects of the mixed emulsions were larger than that of the sole emulsion of o-dichlorobenzene, and among the four kinds of mixed emulsions, it was observed that the larger the amount of lindane in the emulsion, the stronger the retarded lethal effects. As was already reported by the authors, the use of o-dichlorobenzene aparently induced the immediate appearance of intoxication signs of the larvae which lacked in the simple lindane emulsions. Here, it was ascertained that the lethal time was shortened by the order of the increased contents of lindane in the mixtures. According to summarizing the results obtained by the "rice-husks method" and by the other methods in the laboratory and in the field, the authors were led to the conclusion that the effects of the mixed emulsion of 50% o-dichlorobenzene and 7.5% or 5% lindane and that of the sole emulsion of 10% lindane were nearly the same level against the larvae of S. peregrina.

N2  - The poisoning effect of agricultural insecticides on domestic animals has been brought to light quite recently throughout Japan. It is generally believed that the marked recent decrease in mosquito population is largely due to the use of insecticides. In this connection we carried out experiments on larval mosquitoes, freshwater fishes and snails with 2-4D, BHC, Folidol, Endrin, D-N emulsion, Neo-Gikulon, etc. Folidol killed larval mosquitoes (4th instars) in 2 days at a dilution of 0.1 p.p.m., which is in general use in this area. Endrin was selectively destructive on fishes though believed harmless to man and domestic animals.

N2  - An outbreak of Japanese B encephlitis took place in 1953 at an unusual early date (June) in a limited area in the city of Kurashiki. Our observation which we have been conducting since 1950 on the seasonal occurrence of mosquitoes in Okayama City has shown that the increase of population of mosquitoes, especially of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, would have some correlation with the outbreak of B encephalitis. Based on this finding we expected that there might be a certain correlation between the early outbreak of the encephalitis and early activity of this mosquito in this particular area, but so far as our investigation by light-trap is concerned no definite conclusion has been reached.

N2  - Many studies on the substances that control the insect metamorphosis have done recently and Butenandt has successed to obtein the "verpuppungshormon" in the crystall form from silkworm pupa in 1954. However, the progress of the body constituents in insect tissue during metamorphosis is not yet enoughly explained. In this paper the investigations about the relation between tissue prctein and free aminoacid during metamorphosis of Cu'ex pipiens were carried out to explain certain parts of above question. The result is shown on the Fig. I. The results can be summarized as follows : Free amino-acids in tissues are much aboundant in 3 and 4-instar larvae and they decrease rapidly just after pupation. Although the free amino-acids content increases slightly in pupal stage, it is relatively constant during this stage and similarly it does not show any notable changes after emergence. On the other hand the tissue protein is most scant in 3-instar larvae and it increases rapidly in accordance with their developement to the 4-instar larvae and pupation. During pupal stage the tissue protein content is constant generally and it is also similar after emergence. Such rapid decrease of free amino acids and the rapid increase of protein in tissues during pupation suggest the vigorous histogenesis for producing the new tissues in this stage. And during the pupal stage contents of free amino-acids and protein are both constant in general. This constancy seems to show the histolysis and histogenesis progress in this stage relatively constant or may utilize chiefly the free amino acids during pupation and glycogen and fat substances during pupal stage. Quality of free amino acids in each stages of 4-instar larvae, pupae (initial stadium), pupae (end stadium), adults (initial stadium) are shown on Table I, estimated by paper chromatography. It shows the presence of : in 4 instar larvae 18 free amino-acids (α-alanine, glutamic acid, leucine & isoleucine, proline, histidine, serine, valine, methionine, lysine, arginine, aspartic acid, glycine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, cystine, hydroxyglutamic acid, methionine sulfoxide), in pupae of initial stadium 11 (α-alanine, glutamic acid, leucine & isoleucine, histidine, valine, elysin, arginine, aspartic acid, glycine, tyrosine), in pupae of end stadium 8 (α-alanine, glutamic acid, leucine & isoleucine, valine, arginine, glycine, tyrosine), and in adults 10 (α-alanine, glutamic acid, leucine & isoleucine, proline, histidine, valine, lysine, arginine, glycine) respectively. These results seem to indicate also that the free amino acids content in 4-instar larvae is much predominant as compared with them in the pupal or adult stages.

N2  - Questioned as differently among species of the Culex pipiens strains had for long been repeated or scrutinized, but in the year of 1951 the questionables as such became scrutinized by Mattingly et al. Viewing from the world map of districts, it proved to cross with each other between pipiens in the North Temperate and fatigans (quinquefusciatus) in the South, so some of the intermediate type of both species as above mentioned were known as C. p. var. pallens being able to see in Japan and China which can be made unautogenous on the one hand, and as C. molestus together with C. comitatus and other being distributed in various parts of Europe and America which can be made autogenous on the others. These were scrutinized to have been different to that of Culex pipiens strains. Since C. p. var. pallens on the hand to be seen in Japan was made known as a subspecies by Edwards in 1921, the autogenous species of this strains has not been reported in Japan, but it was possible to find out at the subway or basement of ironcon-creted buildings in Osaka City and so I intend to make a bid for some data acquired from morphological and ecological point of view on the foregoing question of the difference. I collected this autogenous pipiens got from a water-lodged basement in the form of larvae and fed them in our laboratory and completed the third generation in succession for experimentation. In addition to that, I conducted to study of whether or not there has been different among C. p. var. pallens, C. molestus and others morphologically and ecologically in their comparison. Compared to pallens as morphological, the species (autogenous) in the form of adult was a little smaller in size, body is pale brown in color, palps short, indistinctive of yellowish fleck on each one of bases of the abdominal segments, not having of the white belt in the respective end of femur and tibia of hind legs, the ratio of length of cell R_2, M_2 in its wing petiole is large in size, male hypopygial phallosome flatly more or less, in larva length of siphon long, siphonalhairs, pectens, and lateral scales in number more than that of pallens and these characters have been suggested as an intermediate form between pipiens and pallens, anal gill is comparatively shorter. Morphological type of view in both of the adult and larva is appeared near to C. moleslus, but as there are many variations in each one of population, it is seen to be involved in the range of pallens. The adult, ecologically speaking, under-ground spot to live can be active all the year round in case of more than 70 per cent of humidity, around 28 Centigrade in Summer season and 14C. in Winter but it makes no hibernation at all. In Winter, it was seen that the adult species could do well to bite and to suck blood in natural state of affairs and larvae of this strains were also seen in such clean water-lodged place as being comprised in its water quality, with a lot of chlorine, which indicated of alkaline pH 9.5 in the highest. To speak of the water temperature there was little change of phenomonon throughout the year but some 12 Centigrade in Winter and some 28 C. in Summer. In respect to an influence of the salinity, it was less changeable in comparison with pallens as the result of having done experiments on the change of the consistency in divers manner by function of the anal gill which is regarded as its taking-in organ and showed a value being between pipiens and pallens. As for the fnfluence of the larvae towards temperature conditions, they were comparatively fast in its growth at a low point of thermometer and slow in the high point, but more than 30 Centigrade brought them to a standstill on the way of growth and to death without pupalization in the end. Even adult of this strains in the case of over 30 Centigrade went down its reproductive function and was known near to pallens judging from the morphological side of view. Although there was no explanation to be sure to decide yet in regard to the exact mechanism of the autogeny, this species in the form of adult was possible to make stenogamy, without hibernation, thus being active even in Winter, and live in a place of low temperature if anything. In the meantime, larvae of this strains were able to live in a clean waterside not to make sunshine, so it is thought that there were things as being based npon a condition of the living environments as well as nutrients in minute quantities rather than ovarian follicles' development which has been regarded as an accumulation of organic substances at the times of the larva. Though the species of this strains is seen about the same with molestus. it is neared to pallens because of being made so much in variation ecologically, it seems to be an ecological variation (seasonal form), which is subjected to the environmental adaptation. In this connection. the species of this strains together with intermediate type of species comprising molestus in Europe and America likewise pallens are regarded as the subspecies of C. pipiens. As Mattingly et al said in the above, the species of this strains is considered to get in the range of Culex pipiens complex.

N2  - Field surveys were made on the ectoparasite of the wood mice at KARAO-valley, HIROKAWA-cho, ARITA-gun, WAKAYAMA-ken, JAPAN, through a year from July 1954 to June 1955. In the present paper, as a part of these surveys, we report on the seasonal fluctuations of the population of chigger mites and their species complex. The results are as follows; 1. Throughout these surveys, 59 individuals of mice as host and 5281 individuals of chiggers of 9 different species as ectoparasites are captured. 2. We can divide following three types in the seasonal fluctuations of their populations which are represented by the mean numbers of the collected chiggers per one host. A. During the all seasons can be caught, but few. Trombicula kansai, Gahrliepia suduski. B. The mode of population appeares in November or December. T. kitasatoi, T. pallida, T. miyajimai. T. japonica. C. The mode of population appears in January or February. T. fuji, T. kochiensis, T. daisen. 3. Chigger fauna at the different area does not differ significantly. 4. Average number of the rankings of abundance of each species on the whole individuals of captured mice (Ranking index), does not always change in parallel with the mean of population density of each species. 5. By the difference of fluctuation of the rankings of abundance of each chigger, the species complex of mites on each mouse can be divided into following three types; A. Standard deviation of the ranking is always smaller than 1 T. fuji, T. kochiensis. B. Standard deviation of the ranking varies from 0 to 2 T. kitasatoi, T. pallida, G. suduski. C. Standard deviation of the ranking is always larger than 1 T. daisen, T. kansai, T. miyajimai, T. japonica. 6. The correlation between the body weight of the host and collected number of the chiggers is highly significant, and its correlation coefficient is +0.602.

N2  - A study of the control has been made on Warfarin for house-rats in specified area. The chemical is consumed most by animals 3-4 days later, and dead animals are found most 6-7 days later baiting. Graphically the curve of consumption is parallel with that of the number of fatality. It implies that the baiting of this chemical must be carried out over rather a long period.

N2  - 1. Mosquitoes were collected by a New Jersey type light trap throughout a whole year from May, 1952 to April, 1953 at the backyard of Yasui Primary School, Uzumasa, Ukyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan. 2. The station where the trap was set locates on the boundary zone between the town area and the cultivated land, and is surrounded by rice-fields except on the north side which is crowded with houses. 3. The whole night sampling which was made 41 times during the period mentioned above yielded 8, 655 individuals classified into 5 genera including 19 species. 4. Of the species obtained, Culex pipiens (32.6%), Culex tritaeniorhynchus (29.0%) and Anopheles sinensis (26.0%) are outstandingly large in individual number, while such species as Culex vishnui (9.0%), Culex bitaeniorhynchus (1.4%), Culex rubithoracis (0.7%) and Armigeres subalbatus (0.4%) constitute, though rather small in number, components which cannot be ignored. The other species are less than 0.1%. 5. Culex pipiens : Wintering females are captured scatteringly in March and April and males appear from about the middle of May. Then mosquitoes are captured almost continuously till the end of November. This species has, therefore, the longest interval of activity, the maximum occuring towards the end of June. 6. Culex tritaeniorhyncus : Females first appear towards the end of May and males in the middle of June. There is the maximum about the end of July and sudden disappearance late in September. 7. Anopheles sinensis : Females are captured scatteringly in March and April and males first appear in the middle of May. An abrupt increase in number is seen early in July and disappearance early in October, the maximum being attained towards the end of July. 8. Culex vishnui : Females appear late in June and males early in July. There is the maximum in the middle of August and disappearance about the end of September. 9. Culex bitaeniorhynchus : Females are captured first early in June but not for about a month that follows. This species is seen almost continuously from the middle of July to the end of September, the maximum being attained toward the end of July. 10. Culex rubithoracis : This species is captured by small numbers almost continuously from the middle of July to the middle of September. Males become considerably large in number during the later part of October. 11. Armigeres subalbatus : This species is captured from the end of August to the middle of October. The largest numbers were obtained about September 20. 12. The other species were obtained only discretely by small numbers and it is difficult to describe definitely the general modes of seasonal variation. 13. There are appreciable differences among the periods of maximal appearance of various species, and, on the whole, there seems to be a tendency of species to segregate seasonally their appearance. 14. Comparing the present results with those that have been hitherto published, it is concluded that the seasonal variation of appearance in the adult mosquitoes may differ under different environmental conditions around the station and by different methods of sampling, and that it cannot be interpreted in terms of the latitude or climate. 15. Since investigating the seasonal variation of the mosquito population aims ultimately at finding out the causal relation between it and the seasonal variation of the environmental factors, the latter should be approached not through summarizing the common aspects but through analysing the different features of succession obtained of each species by different methods and at stations of different environmental conditions. 16. In addition, general methodological consideration was made on the light trap sampling.

N2  - In the summer of 1954, the observation on the diurnal rhythmic activity of the unattached larvae of Trombicula akamushi (Brumpt, 1910), the vector of Tsutsugamushi disease, was made in a certain wood along the Omono River in northwestern Honshu, Japan. The number of the mites crawled up on nine black bakelite-plates, which had been set on the ground surface two days before the observation, was counted every hour for 37 and 11 consecutive hours. Four counts were made in each hourly observation at intervals of five minutes. According to the results, the mite count was the highest at 3 : 00 or 4 : 00 P.M. and a less inconspicious increase was seen at 11.00 A.M. In the night time from 7 : 00 P.M. to 6 : 00 A.M., the mites seemed to be much less active than in the daytime. Such environmental factors as the air temperature and the relative humidity 2cm above the plate, the soil temperature 10cm beneath the soil surface and the light intensity on the plates were measured at each time of the counts. It was revealed that the number of the mites observed on the plates showed significant positive correlation to the soil temperature or the light intensity, and significant negative correlation to the relative humidity, but that between the number of the mites and the air temperature was not significant. Among the numbers of the mites in four counts at each observation, the first counts were usually the lowest, and was the highest the last counts. The difference between average numbers of the first and the second, and that between the second and the third were statistically significant, but that between the third and the fourth was not significant.

N2  - To make investigations on the repellents against rats (Rattus norvegicus var. albinus), we tried to experimental repellents of rats with several chemicals : 1. γ-BHC (crystal)-Ortho-DichloroBenzene mixed solvent has made the most effective to their repellents in the case of using trial chemicals this time (after solving γ-BHC of 20g. into acetone of 70g., 20cc. ortho-dichlorobenzene together with 1cc. eugenol added to the above and it was made of 100cc. in total quantities). 2. Mixed chemicals composed of 1.8l. creosote, 400g. naphthaline and 180cc. gasoline, being used for hare's repellents in general are shown effectivelly against to the most.

N2  - The murine lice in Japan known untill May, 1955 were composed of nine species belonging to two genera; they were Polyplax spinulosa, P. serrata, P. abscisa, P. reclinata, Hoplopleura affinis, H. acanthopus, H. oenomydis, H. longula and H. intermedia. As for the hosts of these lice, ten species of rodents and Suncus murinus, which belonged to the family Soricidae, were recorded. Host-parasite relationships, records of specimens and brief differential descriptions, together with a key to these Japanese lice were given in this paper. Although the characters of paratergal plates were fairly different among the three groups of specimens collected each from Microtus montebelli, Eothenomys smithii smithii and Clethrionomys rufocanus bedfordiae, the author, for the time being, identified all these speicmens as Hoplopleura acanthopus. Hoplopleura oenomydis collected from Rattus rattus in Honson, Nijima-island, Honshu, provided with the very larger spiracles on paratergal plate than those of the specimens collected from other places in Japan. Hoplopleura akanezumi Sasa, 1950 was included in Haplopleura affinis in this report, because these two species related very closely in many respects except for the slight difference of convexity on the process of sternal plate. Pending problems described above will be cleared in future when the author is able to obtain more specimens.

N2  - Using small model pots, the effect of various insecticides was observed against the fly-maggots which are the main pest in the excrement-pot of our native-type lavatories. The result agrees rather well with the one obtained by a careful practical test which is an extremely laborious work. The obtained dorsage-mortality regression line was examined to be satisfactory by x^2 test. The effective concentration for ortho-dichlorobenzene emulsion was revealed to be 50-100 times dilution of the original emulsion, and for lindane 200-1000 times. If the dosage is sufficiently high, o-dichlorobenzene emulsion, lindane emolsion, lindane-o-dichlorobenzene mixed emulsion and linda ne powder have nearly equal efficiency. In a highly diluted concentration lindane emulsion still shows a high efficiency. It was also confirmed that the effectiveness is strongly influenced by the condition of the excrement, that is, whether it is liquid or solid, as well as by the amount of used toilet-papers in the pot. So far as a practical effective dorsage of the emulsion is concerned the maggots fled from the pot due to the stimulation of the emulsion were considered to be negligible in considering the mortality of maggots. A practical effective concentration should be decided by a careful examination of the condition of each lavatory.

N2  - The experiments on the effect of o-dichlorobenzene emulsion against the larvae of Sarcophaga spp. were carried out in the laboratory and in the pots of lavatories comparing to that of lindane emulsion. As presented by Toyama and Suzuki (Botyu-Kagaku, 19, 115-121, 1954), lindane was effective in higher dilutions than o-dichlorobenzene by such method in the laboratory, but the latter chemical had a comparatively high insecticidal efficacy. In the present experiments, the test insects (3rd instar larvae of Sarcophaga peregrina R.-D.) dipped in the emulsion of the chemical for 24 hours were kept in the other petri-dishes till some of them pupated and emerged, and the number of pupae and emerged adult flies were counted. In the experiments of lindane emulsions, the retarted lethal effect was sometimes seen in the advanced stages, some larvae being incapable of forming pupae, some pupae died in situ, or newly emerged adults were seen to survive only a few days. In o-dichlorobenzene or DDT, such retarded effects were not observed. In the experiments in the petri-dishes, the action of o-dichlorobenzene was more rapid than that of lindane so far as the sign of intoxication of the larvae appeared. However, the lethal action of the latter chemical was more rapid than the former. Through the field experiments, the standard amounts of the insecticides required for the practical control of fly larvae in the lavatory pots were concluded as follows : o-dichlorobenzene emulsion, 2 liters of 30-100 times dilution per square meter; lindane emulsion, 2 liters of 100-300 times dilution per square meter. It was also observed that the more the contents of the pots were solid, the larger was the amount of the insecticides required.

N2  - In the present papers, the authors report on the new findings pertaining the ecology and the mechanism of attaching to the hosts of the unengorged larvae of Trombicula scutellaris Nagayo et al., the vector of Shichito-type Tsutsugamushi disease or winter-autumn scrub typhus. In Hachijo Isiand, they were found to appear on the surface of rocks forming large patches soon after the observers approached. Through the laboratory experiments using models (corn made of Plaster of Paris, trianglar paper, etc.), the larvae sho-wed negative pboto and geotaxis and stayed still forming a cluster near the top and opposite to the light when they were not stimulated. Then, an important fact was discovered that the resting larvae were immediately stimulated by the exhalation of human or rats and began to move around the top until they attached to the hosts or rested still in the original position after about half an hour. The factor in the exhalation to stimulate the larvae was certified to be certified to be carbon dioxide, as it was absorbed by alkali and the same effect was exhibited by the application of the air containing up to about 0.000008% of chem ically prepared carbon dioxide.

N2  - A series of fleas from bats, Pipistrellus savii, represent the first collection of Nycteridopsylla from Korea and are of an unnamed species. This new form shows affinities with N. chapini Jordan, the genotype of Eptescopsylla I. Fox, but we follow Hopkins (1952, p.364) in considering Eptescopsylla a synonym of Nycteridopsylla.

N2  - In the previous paper of this series on the ecology of trombiculid mites, some accounts of the collecting method using bakelite plates were reported. The technique made it possible to survey the unengorged stage of the larvae of chigger in natural conditions on the fields. The unengorged larvae are the very stage which attack human or other hosts and are of epidemiological importance. The present study was designed to obtain the informations about the surface distribution of Trombicula scutellaris Nagayo et al, 1921, which is suspected to be the vector of Shichito Fever, the scrub typhus in Izu Seven Islands of Tokyo. The experiments were conducted at the Hachijo Island, the most southern one in the Archipelago, in December 1953, during the season of the endemic. Small bakelite plates (5×5cm^2) were placed upon the surface of the ground and the number of chigger mites that crawled up to the plate after 5 minuites was observed. To survey all over the surface of 1 square meter ground, two hundred and twenty two sheets of small plate were used. They were sufficient to cover nearly all of the surface of 1m^2 area. The temperature and relative humidity (2 cm height over the surface), the illuminating intensity, pH of soil at the surface and the soil temperature (10cm beneath the surface) were also observed at 25 points in the area. The results of the experiments indicate that the unengorged larvae of Tr. scutellaris are not scattered at random on the ground surface, but they form a certain type of congregation or patch. The findings that support this view are as follows : 1. The frequency distribution of the observed number of mites per plate did not fit to that of Poisson's distribution. 2. The divergence coefficient (F_0=V/X^^-) was obviously larger than 1. 3. The gamma type compound of Poisson distribution fitted to our case. 4. Un-uniformity of numbers of scattered mites was also shown by the analysis of variance. 5. The spacial correlation was examined according to the method introduced by Student (1907). 6. It was pointed out that both the structural correlation coefficient (r) and ratio (η) were not zero, and r>0, η>0 were confirmed. Thus the surface distribution of this chigger mite was shown not to be that of "by chance, " and the structure of spacial distribution apparently consisted of patches. The correlations between the observed number of chiggers and the micro-meteorological observations were also examined. The results showed that the temperature had positive correlation with the number of chiggers and the humidity negative one. The soil temperature, illuminating intensity and soil pH were found not to have any correlation.

N2  - 1. Simulium aokii Takahasi, 1941 (possibly the synonym of S. oitana) is one of the commonest blackflies in Japan which seriously attack humans. In the present paper, the distribution and behavior of this species observed by the author and his colleagues are reported. 2. Eggs, larvae and pupae of this species were found abundantly in lowland streams such as irrigation ditches. They were occasionally collected in mountain streams of Honshu and Kyushu. 3. The oviposition of the females were made in the evening on wet substrates on or near the stream surface. The author observed, for example, that in 70 minutes 16 females deposited their eggs side by side in a large mass, finally attained to about 0.7cm wide and about 4cm long, on the surface of a wet blade of the aquatic plant (Sparganium ramosum), one of their most typical ovipositing substrates. While a few females laying eggs on their favorite substrates, the others were flying around to wait for their turn. An egg mass which was oviposited by a female consisted of 150-300 eggs. The eggs required about 10 days to hatch in the laboratory in March, under the room temperature of 8-16℃ at noon. 4. The larvae were found most abundantly in clear lowland streams of 1 to 0.3m wide and under the flowing velocity of 10 to 30m per minute. 5. In nature, the larvae prefer to attach on the tip of the lower surface of long tapering leaves less than 10cm below the water surface. However, the main facter in the choice of their habitat is not the kind of substrates, but their environmental conditions stated above. 6. The larvae being sedentary in its habitat on the favorable conditions, but they frequently change their position by looping-movements and by hanging with a fine silk thread which is secreted from the salivary slit. 7. The flight range of the females were observed in biting experiments on humans set in positions of every 100 meters from their closest breeding streams. The maximum number was seen right close the stream, but a few were collected up to the most distant site of 1, 000m. 8. Their seasonal occurrence was observed by collections at least once a month all through the year. The biting activities were found over the year, but were most serious from May to July. 9. The host preference for human, horse, cattle and goat was experimented. This species was found to be mainly attracted to human. Only a few specimens have so far been collected from cattle or horse.

N2  - This report contains the results of investigations on the increase in effectiveness of DDT by adding piperonyl cyclonene for the DDT-resistant insects. In the present experiments DDT-resistant or nonresistant strains of human body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis), common housefly (Musca domestica vicina), and Drosophila melanogaster were used. These insects were exposed on the residues of aceton solutions of pp'-DDT containing various amounts of piperonyl cyclonene applied to filter paper in a petri dish. It revealed that piperonyl cyclonene, added the same or a halp amount of the DDT, markedly increased the toxicity of DDT-resistant insects, but showed less marked effect upon the susceptible or nonresistant strains.

N2  - Two species of subgenus Culiciomyia have been recorded from Japan, these are Culex pallidothorax Theobald, 1905, and Culex kyotoensis Yamaguti et LaCasse, 1952, and both species are found in the southwestern parts of Japan. Another species of Culiciomyia, Culex ryukyensis Bohart, 1946, was reported from the Ryukyu islands. Since 1948 Dr. S. Hayashi, Mr. H. Koide and the authors have collected many specimens of one species of Culiciomyia, which distinctly differs from the above species. This species was found in Honshu (Ikaho, Fuji, Mitsutoge, Yugawara, Atami, Hakone and Nikko) and Kyushu (Kagoshima and Miyazaki). This species is also different from all other related species of Culiciomyia, and is considered as an undescribed species. This mosquito is closely related to Culex pallidothorax, C. kyotoensis and C. ryukyensis, but it distinctly differs from these species by the characteristics of dark pleural stripes, wing venation, palpal length of male, male terminalia, shape of larval siphon and length of siphonal hairs. The female of this species does not seem to attack human beings. The larvae of this species are found in clear water such as rock pools, artificial containers and the stumps of cut bamboo with Aedes japonicus, Aedes flavopictus, Tripteroides bambusa, Uranotaenia bimaculata and Armigeres subalbatus. The name of this species is dedicated to Dr. Manabu Sasa, who has been a pioneer of medical entomology in Japan since World War II.

N2  - Studying on ascarid immunity of the infected guinea-pigs, we obtained the next results : 2. The polysaccharide fraction of the pig ascarid ingredient is somewhat labil in its desolved state, its specific antigenity decreasing gradually during several months. 2. In every point the polysaccharide fraction of the pig ascarid ingredient is quite similar to that of the ascarid metabolites, after the results of the skin test, chromatography and melting-points. 3. Regarding the protein fraction of the pig ascarid ingredient, the albumin- and globulin-components show no distinct difference after the results of the skin test. 4. The acquirement of the antigenity during the development of the ascarid eggs may not depend on the qualitative change of the components, but on the number of germ cells. 5. No difference was proved in their antigenity between the organs of the ascarid; skin, reproductive organs, intestine and body cavity fluid.

N2  - 1. We have reasons to think that the census method using E(Y)=(N-x)p is most highly appreciable in practice for the present, the equation holding on the assumptions that events of capture for marked and unmarked animals are independent of each other and respective probability of the event for both is constant; P of y=(x/P)^β seems to give some underestimate as compared with N, but the index β keeping its meaning as before may still characterize general trap response of a population. Thus a revised method for measuring post-poisoning populations was devised on the basis of principles of the former equation. 2. Field works were executed with Microtus-populations to make practical use of this procedure; the reduction ratio of them was computed as about 0.1 by applying previously known values of P and π for want of the data, the results approximating round numbers of kills which were on biological grounds determined from the consuming frequency of poison baits. The "new object reaction" of the populations was found plainly smaller to the powerful baits than to traps, accordingly, for this species tending to have lesser trappability, enumeration of kills from the consuming frequency of poisons would seem practically of more advantage over estimation by trapping.

N2  - We have collected many ectoparasites from ten bats, Nyctalus maximus aviator THOMAS, caught alive in a hole of a tree, Betula ermanicham var. communis, in the botanical garden of our university. These parasites were as follows : 1. Spinturnix vespertilionis SCOPOLI 2. Liponyssus britanicus RADFORD 3. Ischnopsyllus elongatus (CURTIS) 4. Cimex pipistrelli JENYNS 5. Unidentified species The last one was defective, the body having been so destroyed that the identification was difficult. Four species of these parasites were studied morphologically and described.

N2  - 1. The correct nomenclature of the four species of Trombicula (Leptotrombidium) described by Nagayo and others, namely pallida, palpalis, intermedia and scutellaris, was discussed together with the designation of the original paper, lectotypes and type localities of these species. 2. Morphological characterisitics of larvae of Trombicula scutellaris under the present taxonomical aspects were discussed. They are morphologically most closely related to Trombicula akamushi, the vector of the classical Tsutsugamushi disease, but are considered to be definitely of different species. 3. Out of about 200 times of collections made by the author and his colleagues for search of Tsutsugamushi covering all of the four main islands of Japan, Trombicula scutellaris was recovered from 12 regions of Izu Islands, Chiba, Shizuoka, Fukui, Kyoto and Kagoshima Prefectures. The species was also recorded by Nagayo and others from Yamagata and by Kawamura and others from Niigata in the same locality as they collected akamushi. The species was considered not so widely distributed as such species like fuji, pallida, kitasatoi or G. saduski. 4. The seasonal distribution of this species is peculiar in its appearance restricted in autumn in northern regions and longer through late autumn to early spring in southern regions like Hachijo Island. 5. Larvae of this species were readily collected from ground surface of infested area by black plates or by boots, as was observed in other human biting chiggers like akamushi. The species was also proved to take a very wide range of hosts in rodents, domestic animals or birds, suggesting that humans could not be the exception. 6. The new type of Tsutsugamushi disease defined here as "winter scrub typhus" was discussed. Through epidemiological studies and ecological observation on mites, Trombicula scutellaris was suggested as the vector of this disease in Izu Islnd, Chiba and other areas. The disease highly prevalent in Hachijo Island and possibly in other areas is characterized in its occurrence in the winter season, extremely low mortality, high morbidity rate of young children and the almost equal sex ratio. 7. The possibility that the recovery of Trombicula scutellaris from certain areas would suggest the occurrence of the disease was discussed. On the other hand, exmaples of the occurrence of the similar type of the disease from regions where no specimens of this species was recovered and certain other species like pallida was abundantly collected were given. In view of the assumption that there would be much more localities in and outside of Japan where Trombicula scutellaris occurs without being discovered, and that other more widely distributed species like pallida may also act as the accidental vector, it is highly probable that winter scrub typhus might have been very widely scattered in rural areas of Japan under the misdiagnosis with related diseases like murine typhus.

N2  - 1. I was engaged in a survey of rodents and their parasitic fleas in Inner Mongolia from February 1944 to June 1945. I would like to discuss in this paper information obtained on house-rats and their fleas. 2. I collected 147 Rattus norvegicus norvegicus and 15 Mus molossinus in 6 districts of Inner Mongolia. 3. The flea fauna of Rattus norvegicus norvegicus were comprised of 4 genera and 4 species as follows : a. Xenopsylla cheopis (Rothschild, 1903) -289 (65%) b. Monopsyllus anisus (Rothschild, 1908) -128 (29%) c. Nosopsyllus fasciatus (Bosc, 1801) -26 (6%) d. Pulex irritans Linnaeus, 1758 -5 (1%) 4. The average number of fleas per Rattus norvegicus norvegicus was 3.0 and the average number of Xenopsylla cheopis per R. n. n. was 2.0. 5. The house-rat and flea fauna of Inner Mongolia is similar to that of North China.

N2  - In order to examine the periodical occurrence theory in mosquitoes, introduced by S. Shibata in 1948, the authors investigated the larval instar-ratio of malaria mosquito Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis Wiedemann in the rice-field at Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture. If Shibata's theory is just, the periodical change of the instar-ratio must be regular as shown in Fig. 1 (black : young stage, oblique line : old stage). But from the investigation data in years 1951 and 1952 (Fig. 2), the authors are unable to recognize the above-mentioned tendency. The variation of instar-ratio is not small, but the authors consider that the percentage of young stage is higher in general except after heavy rains (in Fig. 2 the mark shows the case). Moreover, the authors have to point out the relationship between the seasonal changing of instar-ratio (Fig. 2) and the population density of adult. For example, the falling of young stage ratio toward August may be controlled by the decrease of adults. As the conclusion the authors oppose Shibata's theory so far as the species occurred in the rice-field is concerned.

N2  - 1) Observations and colletions of swarms of Culex pipiens pallens were made from May through November, 1950 at Sinmei town, Fukui prefecture. 2) The percentage number of female against male in the swarming population is somewhat variable according with the season, but as a whole, the value was about one percent. This suggests that in the course of evening swarm of this mosquito species, one female against 100 males will be always found without regard to the place, time and season. 3) The males of this species continue the swarm formation during a period of one month or more after the females ceases from entering house or cow-shed to feed, showing that the swarming habit survives the feeding habit at low temperatures below 15℃. in average for month. The last female in a swarm was obtained as late as on 24th November. 4) The starting time of swarming is at 15-10 Lux in mid Summer but in mid October it is at 500 Lux or above and in the last part of the month it is at about 1200 Lux and finally in late November it is at about 1700 Lux, showing that the time progressively getting fast mainly with the days becoming short and partly with the decrease in temperature when it is below 20℃. or so. 5) 285 individuals (243♀ and 42♂) belonging to eight species were found mingling within the swarm of this species, of which C. tritaeniorhynchus was the most numerous. It is strange that the total number (197) of the female mosquito of the above species by far precedes that (110) of the female of C. pipiens pallens itself. 6) Considerations on the functions of swarming and on the factors governing swarm formation were made.

N2  - Studies of the development of DDT and γ-BHC (Lindane) resistance in natural populations of lice, Pediculus humanus corporis de Geer, in Japan have been conducted during 1952 and 1953. Lice were collected from five different localities in Japan for the comparison of their resistance to DDT and γ-BHC. They were Itabashi asylum in Tokyo where frequent dusting with 10% DDT powder had failed to control the lice and two slums and two primary schools (at Ueno in Tokyo, Sapporo, Ponbetsu, and Atsuda in Hokkaido) which, so far as could be learned, had been treated infrequently, if at all. They were continuously exposed on the filter paper in a petri dish treated with pp′-DDT (at the rate of 7g per square foot) and γ-BHC (at the rate of 0.234mg per square foot), and time-mortality were recorded. From these data the regression of probit mortality on log-time was computed, and the exposure time required to produce 50 per cent mortality (LT-50) in order to obtain the informations as to the relative resistance of the lice in the different installations. The LT-50 was 112.0 hours for the female and 71.26 hours for the male of the Itabashi strain, whereas 28.27 hours and 21.50 hours for the Sapporo strain, which indicated that the Itabashi strain could endure 3.31 to 3.96 times as much of DDT as that of the Sapporo strain. The lice from the slums at Ueno in Tokyo showed the LT-50 on DDT residues of 36.63 hours for the female and 25.48 hours for the male, while those of the lice from the Sapporo strain were 28.27 hours and 21.50 hours respectively. Three strains of Hokkaido were of similar LT-50. The DDT-resistant lice from the Itabashi colony showed no resistance at all to residues of γ-BHC, which gave nearly equal mortalities of the other three strains of lice except in the case of the Atsuda strain. The lice from the primary school at Atsuda showed somewhat less resistance to γ-BHC than those from any of the other sources, although these localities were not known to have been treated with γ-BHC. Genetical experiments of DDT-resistance with the Itabashi strain was also made. The F_1-adults from the crosses of Itabashi ♀×Ueno♂ and Ueno♀×Itabashi♂ were intermediate with regard to the DDT-resistance. Resistance inheritance factors are carried by both sexes.

N2  - Observations on the successions of larvae and pupae of mosquitoes breed in the minute inland waters in the graveyards and the bamboo thickets were conducted from January to December, 1953. In the stone basins on the hilly cemetery, 5006 individuals belonging to 7 species were collected, of which Aedes japonicus (67.0%) was the most common, Aedes albopictus (19.5%), Uranotaenia bimaculata (7.3%), Aedes nipponicus (4.9%) were next in frequency, Orthopodomyia anopheloides nipponica (0.9%), Tripteroides bambusa (0.3%), Culex kyotoensis (0.1%) were found only in small numbers. In the bamboo stubs, 3643 individuals belonging to 6 species were obtained, of which Uranotaenia bimaculata (61.1%) was the most common, Aedes flavopictus (22.7%) was next, and Tripteroides bambusa (8.5%), Armigeres subalbatus (3.1%), Aedes japonicus (2.6%), Aedes albopictus (2.0%) were rather rare. The seasonal prevalencies of these species are shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2. In the stone basins in graveyards, Aedes japonicus appeared all the year round, and was dominant in winter and spring, but in summer Aedes albopictus exceeds it, and in November and December it is out-numbered by Uranotaenia bimaculata. The mode of appearance in the bamboo stubs shows that the terms of appearance of Uranotaenia bimaculata and Tripteroides bambusa are the longest of all, and the former is exceedingly dominant in winter and autumn, while in spring and summer Aedes flavopictus takes its place. The writers would regard these larval livings in two types of water area as independent communities, and propose to appellate them "community in the stone basins on the hilly cemetery" and "community in the bamboo stubs on the height" respectively. Basing on these results, the over-wintering habits and the life histories of each species were comparatively considered, and the constructions and the features of each community were discussed.

N2  - The author describes seven species of cheyletid mites belonging to four genera found in Japan, as shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows the relation between the mites and their hosts or breeding materials, and collecting places. Among these seven species of mites, Cheyletus eruditus and Cheletomorpha lepidopterorum were already recorded from Japan by E. W. Baker in 1949, and Cheyletielta takahasii was found as a new species in 1951 by Sasa and Kano on Ochotona hyperborea yesoensis caught at Mt. Daisetsu in Hokkaido. The presence of the other four species in Japan, that is Cheyletus fortis, Cheyletus rapax, Eucheyletia flabellifera, Cheyletiella parasitivorax are newly reported. As shown in Table 2, the common species of mites that were collected here were Cheyletus fortis from storage foods and Eucheyletia flabellifera on small field rodents. On the other hand, Cheyletus eruditus and Cheletomorpha lepidopterorum which are regarded as cosmopolitan species of cheyletid mites were rather rarely collected.

N2  - Of three species of anopheline mosquitoes breeding in Tokyo district, Anopheles sineroides has, morphologically, intermediate features between A. hyrcanus var. sinensis and A. koreicus. That is to say, the number of the outer clepeal hairs of A. sineroides, the most important specific feature in the larval stage, falls between those of A. hyrcanus var. sinensis and A. koreicus. The white patches on the costal vein and black patches on the sixth vein of A. sineroides are akin to those of A. koreicus and the white patches on the proboscis of A. sineroides are the same with those of A. hyrcanus var. sinensis. The author studied the morphological features of the male hypopigium of these three species to elucidate to which species A. sineroides would be more akin in this respect. The male hypopigium of A. sineroides is distinctly different from that of A. koreicus in the following 4 features. 1) The lobes of 9th tergite of A. sineroides are long and slender in shape while those of A. koreicus are short and thick in shape. 2) The phallosome of A. sineroides and A. koreicus is the same in length but is distinctly broader in the former than in the latter. 3) The number and length of leaflets of phallosome are different in these two species. They are more numerous and shorter in A. sineroides than in A. koreicus. 4) The side-piece of A. koreicus has a distinct dent while that of A. sineroides has not. The hypopigium of A. hyrcanus var. sinensis is quite simillar to that of A. sineroides in those features stated above except in the number and length of the leaflets of phallosome. They are less numerous and shorter in A. hyrcanus var. sinensis than in A. sineroides. A. sineroides which may be regarded as a intermediate type between A. hyrcanus var. sinensis and A. koreicus is more akin to the former in the morphology of male hypopigium.

N2  - The external structure of the egg of Anopheles lindesayi var. japonicus Yamada and the differences between this egg and those of some anopheline mosquitoes are described in this article. 1. The egg of this species is characterized by the following features : (1) The dorsal surface is almost covered with the floats. (2) The frills disappear at the inner portions of speckles which occupying the distal portions of the egg. (3) The speckles have different shape from those of the other species. From these points the egg is readily distinguished from those of A. hyrcanus var. sinensis, A. sineroides, A. koreicus, A. edwardsi, and A. pullus. 2. Though the egg of this variety differs from that of the original species in its length and breadth, number of the float ridges, the ratio of the float length to the total egg length, and in the length of the speckles, it seems to be insufficient to determine whether present variety is identical to A. lindesayi Giles or not.

N2  - The present study was made as to contribute to the basic informations concerning the medical use of "phenothiazine" or "thiodiphenyl-amine." The highly purified phenothiazine was extremely little toxic to laboratory animals such as mice, rabbits or rats, and its LD 50 to mice was 7.0g. per kg. of body weight. Rabbits well tolerated the continuous oral dosis of 1 g. per kg. of body weight for more than one month. By human experiments, the author found that about 50% of orally administered phenothiazine was excreted in urine within 24 hours as red dye, which could be detected by adding hydrogen peroxide. The maximum excretion of the dye in the urine was seen between 5 and 6 hours after the oral administration. The antibiotical effects of the phenothiazine urine to various kinds of bacilli was studied, and the author found that it was more effectively antibiotical to Gramm positive bacilli (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Pneumococci, Micrococcus gonorhoea) than to Gramm negative ones (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.) Experimantal use as antihelmintics to Syphacia obvelata infection in mice was concluded as effective. In Ascaris lumbricoides infection of human cases, oral use of phenothiazine by the rate of 0.5g. per kg. of body weight resulted in the complete erradication of the worm in 59 out of 103 cases (57.3%). The insecticidal effect of the chemical to larvae of Culex pipiens pallens was quantitatively estimated. This was also effective as contact poison to human body louse. Phenothiazine urine containing red dye formed by the in vitro oxidation of phenothiazine was also insecticidal to mosquito larvae.

N2  - Anopheles sineroides may be considered as the intermediate type of A. hyrcanus var. sinensis and A. koreicus as regards the important characteristics distinguishing themselves from each other, as shown in the following table. [table] Patches on the costal vein of A. sineroides are the same with those of A. koreicus. Dark patches on the 6th vein of A. sineroides are the same with A. koreicus in number and the same with A. hyrcanus var. sinensis in position (Fig. A-C). In the current investigation, larvae of A. sineroides were bred in warm (28℃-33℃) and cold (14℃-19℃) chamber and variations in the patches of wings of hatched out adult mosquitoes were carefully examined. The larvae of which the outer clepeal hairs have 10-24 branches were selected and bred in the cold or warm chamber stated above. Among 22 adult mosquitoes obtained from the cold chamber, almost all were the typical sineroides-type; in only 3 specimens, the basal white patch was absent. Almost all of 20 adult mosquitoes obtained from warm chamber, showed marked and constant variation in the patches of costal vein. That is to say, in 16 specimens, both the basal and cubital white patches disappeared and in remaining 4 specimens, the cubital white patch was present. No variation occurred in the middle and apical white patches nor in the dark patches on th 6th vein except in 4 female specimens in which the apical white patch disappeared. (Fig. D). Thus the costal vein of A. sinercides bred in the warm chamber showed quite the same patches as in the A. hyrcanus var. sinensis. I am of the opinion that A. sineroides is quite akin to A. hyrcanus var. sinensis and it is doubtful whether the former is valied to be a distinct species.

N2  - Studies were carried on with Anopheles hyrcanus var. sinensis and A. koreicus. These mosquitoes were collected in and around the city of Tokyo in the stage of the larvae and were bred up to adult in our laboratory. The specimens were divided into 3 groups in both the species by months they were collected : A. hyrcanus var. sinensis [table] The differences of the maxillar indices between the groups I, II, III were not valid statistically, while the differences between the group A, B, C were valid, being A<B<C. The maxillar indices of each group of A. hyrcanus var. sinensis (I, II, III) were larger than those of any one group of A. koreicus (A, B, C). The differences were statistically valid. The length of the wing was larger in the specimens collected and bred in lower atomospheric temperature than those in higher atomo-spheric temperature in the case of A. hyrcanus var. sinensis, that is to say : Group III<Group I<Group II. In the case of A. koreicus, the edwardsi-type had longer wings than the original type. The edwardsi-type has been considered to be a type appearing in cold season. A positive correlation was seen between the length of the wing and the maxillar index. The longer was the wing the larger was the maxillar index.

N2  - In the previous paper (1949), I have reported that among Anopheles lindesayi var. japonicus collected at Kurihama, Kanagawa Prefecture, there were some specimens almost indistinguishable from the original type of this species (in adult stage), and suggested that it might be improper to devide the variey from the original type. During the period from May to September, 1949, larvae of A. lindesaxi were collected at 4 spots in Kanagawa Prefecture, viz, Kazamatsuri, Daiyusan, Hatano and the Lake Ashinoko. So it was conjectured that this species of Anopheles was not rare in this district. The breeding places of this species were the spring or small stream at the foot of the mountains and the water temperature was about 15℃ even in the midsummer. In 3 of the 4 breeding places no larva of other species was found. In the remaining one A. hyrcanus v. sinensis and A. koreicus were found, too. The larvae collected were bred in the laboratory to get adult mosuitoes. Though 250 were collected in total, most of them died before they emerge and only 25 adults were obtained. The laboratory breeding of the larvae of A. lindesayi was far more difficult than those of the other species. The successful breeding was achieved only in June when the atomospheric temperature was rather low, and by changing the water in the container of the larvae every morning and evening to keep cleanness. In contrary to the previous observations, the adult mosquitoes thus obtained all showed the characteristics of A. lindesayi var. japonicus and not a single specimen of the original type was seen.

N2  - Adult anopheline mosquitoes were collected in houses and stables in the vicinity of the Fujimi pond stated in the lst report. The collection of the mosquitoes was made from time to time during the period from July to September, 1948, and 35 females were obtained in total. Most of them were Anopheles hyrcanus v. sinensis, only one A. koreicus being found among them. These mosquitoes were kept alive, feeding blood meals and sugar solutions, until they oviposit. A batch of eggs laid contained from 60 to 280 (mean : 201) eggs and measurements of 200 eggs gave the dimension of 0.506-0.707mm (mean : 0.585mm) in length and 0.145-0.209mm (mean : 0.187mm) in breadth. These eggs were kept in the dish and the larvae, hatched from them, were bred until-they reached to the 4th stage larvae. The morphological characteristics of the larvae of each stage were examined in detail to find, if any, criterion to distinguish the stages of the larvae. Though hairs or groups of hairs on head, thorax and abdominal segments were examined, none of them was decisive of distingu shing the stages of the larvae except the side hair of the 3rd abdominal segment. The number of branches of this hair was quite characteristic of each stages of the larvae, never overlapping with each other, viz : The first stage : two hairs, single to 3 branches. The second stage : one hair, 4 to 8 branches. The third stage : one hair, 9 to 16 branches. The fourth stage : one hair, 17 to 29 branches. These findings are in accord with those reported by Shibata (1947) who collected larvae from ponds and suggested these characteristics statistically.

N2  - Aedes (Banksinella) imprimens (Walker) has been the species only incompletely described; so far, no figures have been given. The author recently identified a mosquito species collected near Sendai to be this species. A great many specimens have been collected since several years ago. The morphological description on adults and pupae of this species is given in this paper. Male and female heads differs in their scaling (fig.1). Male palpi long, uptured, hairly, and composed of a long basal segment, the second segment of moderate length, and a very small apical one (Fig.2). Scutum covered with narrow golden scales. Abdomen black, with white basal bands and lateral spots on each segment. Legs dark brown, with pale basal rings on each segment of tarsi and metatarsi. Male genitalia are very peculiar in its structure (Fig.3). Pupae resemble to those of Aedes esoensis and Ae. vexans, but A-hairs of eighth abdominal segment are 7-8 forked (Fig.4). Their habitat was in temporary ground-pools with decayed leaves.

N2  - Two ponds in different enviroments were selected for the survey. The one, the Shinobazu pond, is located in the city of Tokyo, having crowded shops and residences in surroundings. There is no stream flowing in or out and the water is stagnant and somewhat muddv. The other, the Fujimi pond, is located in the suburb of Tokyo and is surrounded by woods. The water flows in from a corner and flows out from opposite side and is always clear. The Shinobazu pond (ca. 400m×250m) is larger than the Fujimi pond (ca. 400m×100m). The survey was made once a week during a period from May, 1948 to January 1949. In both the ponds, larvae appeared in May, gradually increased in number and gave rise to two seasonal waves. The first wave reached its maximum in the early summer or from the middle of June to the end of July. The second wave reached its maximum in autumn or from the middle of September to the middle of October. After this period the larvae gradually diminished inn umber and finally disappeared in the middle of December. When the seasonal periodicity of each species of Anopheles found in these ponds were considered separately, it is not the same with each other. Anopheles koreicus appeared in May, disappeared at the begining of July and reappeared from the end of August to the begining of October. In the latter period, edwardsi type of this species was also seen in small number. A. koreicus were seen in the Fujimi pond only, not being seen in the Sinobazu pond. This indicates that the species breeds in clear and rather cold water. A. sineroides appeared at the end of June and disappeared at the end of July in both the ponds, being never seen thereafter. A. hyrcanus sinensis was seen from May to Decerrber throughout in the case of Fujimi pond and from June to October, the whole period of the survey made, in the case of Shinobazu pond. All these findings are generally in accord with those reported by Matsubayashi and Sato (1943) in Setagaya district of Tokyo.
