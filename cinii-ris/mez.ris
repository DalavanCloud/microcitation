N2  - We found the 3rd instar larvae of the family Piophilidae (Diptera) in skeletal remains during a forensic autopsy in late December in the Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. Of note, all the larvae were found in the marrow space of the right femur, thus indicating that the piophilid larvae are able to penetrate the bones of human corpse. This fact demonstrates the importance of a careful examination of skeletal remains, and is emphasizing that forensic pathologists should also examine the inside of bones during a forensic autopsy, because such procedures may provide valuable entomological evidence.

N2  - Minami Park located in urban Fukuoka, Kyushu, Japan, is a roosting area for crows. In the park, large numbers of crows gather, resulting in a large population of insects including Diptera in their droppings or carcasses. In addition, many louse flies, Ornithomya avicularia aobatonis, freely fly in the park forest. The louse flies are often attracted to humans, but they do not try to suck blood. Over four years 384 louse flies were collected from the park forest. Only three of the 384 specimens were apparently of older age, and the other 381 flies were young. Collections indicate three peaks of emergence in louse flies per year. The louse fly populations in Minami Park appear to explode in numbers, parasitizing the host birds, and then disperse to the surrounding environment.

N2  - Forty cases of human infestations with hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) were reported in Toyama Prefecture, Honshu, Japan from 1974 to 2009. Causative tick species were Haemaphysalis flava (1 case), H. japonica (2 cases), H. longicornis (3 cases), Haemaphysalis sp. (2 cases), Ixodes acutitarsus (4 cases), I. monospinosus (3 cases), I. nipponensis (6 cases), I. ovatus (11 cases), I. persulcatus (6 cases) and Ixodidae gen. sp. (2 cases). Although serological examination was carried out for antibodies against the borrelial antigen Borrelia burgdorferi in the following 10 cases, the antibody was not detected in 3 of the I. ovatus cases, 1 of I. nipponensis, 3 of I. persulcatus, 2 of I. monospinosus and 1 of Ixodidae gen. sp. A cement-like substance and mucinosis were observed in four cases: 2 of I. ovatus, 1 of I. nipponensis and 1 of Ixodidae gen. sp. by histopathological examination of the infestation sites. This paper reviews the infestations with ticks occurring in Toyama Prefecture between 1973 and 2009. The reported cases occurred during the period from March to December except for November, with the highest incidences in May and June. The ages of the patients ranged from 2 to 88 years. The most common infestation site was the neck of the patients. The majority of the tick infestations were principally acquired in mountainous areas.

N2  - In Taiwan, the important mosquito-borne diseases include Japanese encephalitis (JE), dengue, and malaria, in which only JE is known as an endemic disease at present. This paper updates the current status of these disease vectors and pathogen activities to evaluate the disease risk. Since 2004, small to medium dengue outbreaks (202-2000 cases) have occurred annually, mostly in southern Taiwan where Aedes aegypti (L.) distributes. Occasionally, small outbreaks (smaller than 20) occurred in other areas without the presence of Ae. aegypti. Dengue virus infection in local vector population was detected sympatrically with the human cases in the same outbreak. JE cases have occurred sporadically after the introduction of vaccination program since 1968. The predominant species was Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (93.9%), followed by Cx. fuscocephala Theobald (3.4%), and Cx. vishnui Theobald (2.6%). Overall population densities were high, with the highest number of 37,440 per trap-night. JE virus was active in mosquito populations during May and June. The distribution of Anopheles minimus Theobald was limited to a few villages at the foothills of southern and eastern Taiwan. The highest numbers of An. minimus adults trapped per trap-night were between 23 and 206 in 6 villages. Chikungunya infection has been found in the travelers from endemic countries since 2007. In conclusion, the threat of these mosquito-borne diseases is increasing because of the frequent introductions of pathogens and the high densities of disease vectors in Taiwan.

N2  - The tick fauna in the Misen mountains, an endemic area of Japanese spotted fever, and surrounding areas of Shimane Prefecture, Western Honshu, Japan was surveyed. A total of 7,497 ixodid ticks were collected by flagging in the Misen mountains and surrounding areas. They were classified as four genera and 12 species: Amblyomma testudinarium, Dermacentor taiwanensis, Haemaphysalis cornigera, H. flava, H. formosensis, H. hystricis, H. kitaokai, H. longicornis, H. megaspinosa, Ixodes nipponensis, I. ovatus, and I. turdus. Haemaphysalis kitaokai and H. longicornis were the dominant tick species in the Misen mountains from December to April and from May to August, respectively. Furthermore, the relative abundance of H. kitaokai and H. longicornis were negatively correlated with distance from the Misen mountains. A total of 819 ixodid ticks were collected from sika deer, Cervus nippon, hunted in the Misen mountains because sika deer activity is intensive in the mountains. They were classified as two genera and four species: H. longicornis, H. megaspinosa, I. ovatus and I. tanuki. Of these, H. longicornis occupied 87.6% of the ticks collected from sika deer from April to June. These results suggest sika deer are important hosts of H. longicornis in the mountains. Moreover, it is highly possible that the focal accumulation of H. longicornis in the mountains is dependent on deer density.

N2  - From June to September 2007, cockroaches were collected with sticky traps in four greenhouses of the Botanic Gardens of Toyama, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. A total of 1,968 individuals consisting of seven species, Periplaneta americana, P. australasiae, P. fuliginosa, P. japonica, Imblattella orchidae, Margattea nimbata, and Pycnoscelus surinamensis were captured. Of these, 5 tropical and subtropical species, P. americana, P. australasiae, I. orchidae, M. nimbata, and Py. surinamensis, were recorded for the first time in Toyama Prefecture. These tropical and subtropical species may have been introduced to the greenhouses along with plants. In terms of the species composition of adults, P. australasiae was the most abundant (73.0%), followed by Py. surinamensis (21.3%).

N2  - The tabanid fly fauna and their seasonal prevalence were surveyed with a mosquito-net and NZI traps baited with 2kg of dry ice at 2 municipal pastures in Shibetsu and Rumoi, of north-western Hokkaido, Japan from June to September in 2005 and 2006. A total of 467 flies of 10 species in 5 genera were captured at Shibetsu, and 956 flies of 13 species in 6 genera at Rumoi. At Shibetsu, Tabanus nipponicus was the dominant species followed by Hybomitra distinguenda and T. trigeminus. Tabanus nipponicus was also the dominant species at Rumoi, followed by T. rufidens and T. chrysurus. Hirosia sapporoensis was abundantly captured in Rumoi but not collected in Shibetsu. The fly numbers showed a peak in late July at Shibetsu. In Rumoi, 2 peaks were observed in late July and late August probably due to the effects of rain fall during the collection day in early August.

Laboratory examination of serum taken 14 days after onset of the illness showed elevated titers of antibodies against the Shimokoshi strain of Orientia tsutsugsmushi (IgG: 1:2,560; IgM: 1:5,120). The gene encoding the 56-kDa-protein specific for O. tsutsugamushi was detected by PCR from the patient's blood. Further sequence analysis of the PCR product (1,768 bpfragment including ORF region) revealed 99.4%, and 98.5% similarities to the Shimokoshi strain (Accession No: M63381) at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Therefore, a very rare case of Shimokoshi-type tsutsugamushi disease was found in Yamagata Prefecture. Identification of the trombiculid species of vectors for this type of tsutsugamushi disease is needed in the future.

N2  - Arboviruses transmitted by Culicoides biting midges cause domestic animal diseases such as congenital abnormalities and acute febrile illnesses in ruminants. Epidemics of these arboviruses, Akabane, Aino, Chuzan and Ibaraki viruses, have been frequently reported in the western part of Japan and have brought great economical damage to the livestock industry. These arboviruses are most frequently isolated from Culicoides oxystoma Kieffer in the southern part of Japan, indicating that this species acts an important vector for transmission of these viruses. However, several outbreaks have occurred in the northern regions where C. oxystoma has not been previously observed, suggesting the existence of other vector species. Recently, several arboviruses distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions such as the Peaton, Sathuperi and Shamonda viruses were newly isolated in Japan. Several clinical cases imply these viruses are related to congenital abnormalities in cattle. Global warming is expected to expand the range of arboviruses to higher latitudes because of the brisk activities of the vectors. Therefore, we should provide integrated surveillance systems, sophisticated diagnostic measures and effective prevention strategies to combat the threats of arbovirus infections.

A new species, Opalimosina (O.) australis sp. nov. from Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia (Papua Barat), is described as new to science. The record of Opalimosina (O.) calcarifera (Rohacek, 1975) from Pakistan (Hayashi, 1989) was a misidentification, and it was the same species as a new species described in this paper, so the specimens examined by Hayashi (1989) are included in the type series. Therefore, the record of O. calcarifera is to be eliminated from Pakistan.

N2  - The first nationwide, cross-sectional, online survey of head lice infestation was conducted. A questionnaire was developed by a private research company through consultation with Dan Healthcare Company Ltd. The target population was randomly selected from the research company's database. The survey was available online over a five-day period in December, 2007, to persons that had consented to participate. Of 550,000 registered households, 120,000 were randomly selected and consent was obtained from 57,100. Of these 57,100 households, 1,334 (2.34%) had experienced lice infestations within the previous two year. Of these 1,334 households, 296 were randomly selected and valid data were obtained from 205 households. Of these 205 households, 172 (83.9%) reported lice infestation within the previous one year and 148 (72.2%) reported head lice infestations. The annual household head lice infestation rate was 1.68%, the household incidence of head lice infestation was estimated at 830,000 households/year. Of 148 households with head lice infestations, 141 (95.3%) included members under 20 years of age and 88 (59.5%) reported more than two cases of infestation. Phenothrin was used for control of head lice by 117 (79.1%) households. Of these 117,10 (8.5%) reported that the head lice were not eliminated by treatments.

Tabanus nipponicus (Murdoch and Takahasi) and Haematopota tristis Bigot were captured from Rishiri Island and Hybomitra olsoi Takahasi from Rebun Island. Since no large mammalian species except human beings are available for blood sucking by tabanid flies on both islands, the origin of the anautogenous T. nipponicus individuals is a subject of keen interest for future studies.

This study is the first report of infestations of Solenopotes capillatus in Hokkaido. To date, Solenopotes capillatus has been believed to be a relatively rare species in Japan. However, in this study, the infestations of this species were more common than Linognathus vituli in and outside Hokkaido. Furthermore, we did not find Haematopinus eurysternus, which has been known to date as the most common species in Japan.

Lipoptena fortisetosa was collected from the sika deer Cervus nippon, human bodies, and the black-faced bunting Emberiza spodocephala. On the other hand, L. sikae was collected from C. nippon, human bodies, and the grey bunting E. variabilis. Lipoptena fortisetosa and L. sikae were collected from birds for the first time. Presumably, these cases are accidental host records.

N2  - A systematic mosquito collection was carried out for 3 years from November 2001 to September 2004 in western Lombok Island, Indonesia to clarify Anopheles fauna, and to confirm vector species in malaria endemic areas. Adult mosquitoes were collected at 14 sites in the study area by using double-walled mesh nets with human or cow bait. A total of 11 species were encountered. Anopheles vagus was the most predominant. The second most abundant species differed among the sub-study areas; An. sundaicus was abundant in the coastal plain area, and An. balabacensis in the mountainous area. Anopheles balabacensis showed high anthropophily and exophagy and An. sundaicus moderate anthropophily and exophagy. Malaria parasite detection from the collected mosquitoes was also carried out through the detection of circumsporozoite protein by the VecTest^<TM>. Fourteen and 4 samples, which were positive for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax antigen respectively, were found from An. subpictus, An. sundaicus and An. balabacensis. We conclude that malaria in the coastal plain area is transmitted by An. sundaicus and An. subpictus, whereas An. balabacensis is the primary vector in the mountainous area of Lombok Island.

N2  - Putative serine protease genes including trypsin and chymotrypsin were identified in the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans during an EST project. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are major digestive enzymes involved in the parasite-host interactions of vector insects. In this study, two genes designated Gmmtry1 and Gmmchy1 were further characterized during blood digestion and in responses against parasite infection. Both Gmmtry1 and Gmmchy1 mRNA was expressed at high levels in the posterior region of the midgut. Gmmchy1 transcript increased following an infectious blood meal suggesting chymotrypsin is regulated by the presence of the trypanosome during the early establishment of the parasite infection in the midgut. The possible roles of trypsin and chymotrypsin proteases in determining the refractoriness of the tsetse fly against trypanosomes is also discussed.

N2  - During 1991-2007 a total of 3,562 ixodid ticks were collected by flagging at altitudes from 20 to 1,470m in Toyama Prefecture. Two genera and nine species were identified as follows: Haemaphysalis flava, H. japonica, H. kitaokai, H. longicornis, H. megaspinosa, Ixodes monospinosus, I. nipponensis, I. ovatus, and I. persulcatus. Ixodes ovatus was the most dominant species at elevations of 400m and above, but was also distributed at the low altitudes. Haemaphysalis flava was predominant below 401m above sea level. Haemaphysalis kitaokai, H. megaspinosa, and I. monospinosus were newly recorded in Toyama Prefecture. Rickettsial DNA detected from I. monospinosus was closely related to Rickettsia helvetica, indicating a potential threat of spotted fever group rickettsial infection in Toyama Prefecture.

N2  - Cricotopus bifascia Tokunaga, 1936 is transferred to the genus Paratrichocladius Santos Abreu, 1918 and redescription is added based on the male morphology, particularly well developed but clearly separated antepronotum in the center, upright dorsocentrals originating from conspicuous pits and conspicuous humeral pits. Paratrichocladius yakukeleus Sasa et Suzuki, 2000 is a junior synonym of P. bifascius (Tokunaga, 1936). The most important morphological character of this species is to have black and yellow marks in the body like many Cricotopus species.

N2  - The efficacies of several formulations containing boric acid were tested against an insecticide susceptible strain (Watarida strain, abbr. SS) and field collected colony (abbr. field colony) of the German cockroach Blattella germanica. An arena treated with more than 400mg/m^2 of powdered boric acid or greater than 0.4% aqueous solution showed 100% mortality under laboratory conditions against the SS and the field colony. When the boric acid powder was mixed with powdered sugar and rice bran as food additives, the mortality increased compared with boric acid alone. Accumulated mortalities for a tablet bait formulation with more than 0.4% active ingredient against both colonies, and for gel bait formulations greater than 0.8% against the SS were lower compared with the powder or aqueous solution formulations. Harborages treated with 0.5% and 2% boric acid aqueous solutions in both colonies and 4% solutions for the field colony showed insufficient mortalities. The tested cockroaches may not intake boric acid because boric acid rapidly crystallizes as the solution dries. Direct spraying of 2% aqueous solution into the arena was less effective than the aqueous solution for the same reason. Overall, the boric powder is recommended for practical use because of high efficacy even for the field colony. When 12% boric acid powdered aerosol was sprayed around a restaurant kitchen, German cockroach infestations were repressed for at least two months. Treatment of boric acid powder to the floor and the cracks and crevices is an adequate method for controlling German cockroaches in the field.

N2  - Anopheles hinesorum, a member of the An. punctulatus group, is a widely distributed mosquito species in Australasia. The distribution offers an opportunity to study the population genetic structure of mosquitoes within this region. We determined the genetic variations of An. hinesorum on Guadalcanal and Malaita of the Solomon Islands using cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (COII) sequences. This study revealed that the Guadalcanal population is expanding rapidly, whereas the Malaita population is stationary, and although no genetic structure is present within the islands, significant genetic differentiation is present between the Guadalcanal and Malaita populations.

The features of the family including morphological and biological characteristics of adults and larvae are briefly mentioned. The taxonomic status of the Japanese species of the genus Corethrella: C. japonica (Komyo), C. towadensis Okada and Harada, C. nippon Miyagi and C. urumense Miyagi are also discussed. Corethrella is probably worldwide in distribution but has been overlooked in many areas. Medical entomologists in Japan are expected to pay more attention to the hairy biting midges.

As a result, new distributional records were found in Honshu (south of Ishikawa Pref.) and northern Shikoku. The host species of O. jantseanus were the Reeve's pond turtle Chinemys reevesii and the Japanese pond turtle Mauremys japonica. Most of the leeches were found in the folds of soft tissue between the carapace and the plastron of the turtles. Some of them were found in the orbital cavity or on the carapace. Moreover, clumps of their eggs were often observed attached to the carapace.

N2  - The redback spider (RBS) was discovered at a reclaimed island site in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture in October 2000. Nishinomiya City consequently initiated field surveys and control programmes in October of the same year. The overall results of the control measures up to October 2005 were summarized according to the survey period, month, address in town/street, number of collected male/female/egg sac specimens, and number of inspectors. Some of the data were then plotted onto a map using GIS and remote sensing by aerial photographs in order to analyze the distribution, dispersal fluctuations and causal factors thereof, the effectiveness of control programmes and the possibility of eradication. The number of collected specimens peaked in 2002 and then declined, but the distribution of the spiders has expanded rapidly since 2003. In addition, significant areal differences in the density and habitation frequency have occurred. Furthermore, analysis of aerial photographs and development related documentation reveal a clear relationship between the invasion and establishment of RBS and the subsequent urgent housing development after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake (January, 1995). The results clearly show that the survey season, continuous monitoring and control activity of RBS are extremely important to reduce the population density of RBS in the accidentally infested areas.

Various virus particles were observed in the basal labyrinth that advances to the inside of the cell with various branches. Newly produced viruses were observed in the basal labyrinth. The virus particles were observed in large numbers in the vacuole around the salivary gland cells. Near the basal labyrinth where virus particles were observed, the accumulation of electron dense-thin particles was recognized. Viral morphogenesis in mosquito salivary glands was similar to that in cell cultures. The virus particles appeared to be formed in the epithelial cells of the salivary glands.

N2  - Management of insecticide resistance in the mosquito Culex pipiens complex is important because this complex is a major vector of lymphatic filariasis and West Nile fever, which occurs worldwide, and has been exposed to frequent chemical controls with a variety of insecticides. We applied the SNaPshot assay, a primer extension-based genotyping method, to the identification of both insecticide resistance-associated point mutations at insecticidal active sites and the mosquito subspecies distributed in Japan. Variations at Leu1014 and Val1016 positions in the sodium channel and Ser119 in Drosophila Ace-paralogous acetylcholiesterase (p-Ace) were individually tested for the detection of mutations conferring decreased sensitivity to nerve insecticidal targets. Moreover, sequence differentiations in Drosophila Ace-orthologous acetylcholinesterase (o-Ace) gene were concomitantly tested for the detection of subspecies of Cx. pipiens pollens, Cx. p. molestus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The exactness of the SNaPshot assay was verified using standard laboratory strains and mutagenized synthesized DNA. The assay was then applied to laboratory-colonized mosquitoes that were captured from Kyushu and Honshu, Japan. Judgments for both Cx. p. m. and Cx. p. pallens by SNaPshot assay agreed with the respective autogenicities of the colonies tested, except for an erroneous individual. Mutation of Leu1014 to Phe and Ser in the sodium channel genes were specifically identified in the samples of Cx. p. m. and Cx. p. pallens., respectively. No mutation was detected for the other target sites.

N2  - A bird-parasitic fly, Carnus hemapterus Nitzsch was found from three avian hosts in Japan. A total of 42, 35, and 2 adults of C. hemapterus was collected from nestlings of Eurytomus orientalis (Linnaeus), Dendrocopus major (Linnaeus), and Corvus corone Linnaeus, respectively. Eurytomus orientalis is a new host for C. hemapterus. Almost all flies obtained were dealate, but one alate male and two alate females were found from D. major and E. orientalis, respectively. Two deformed-wing flies were collected from a new nest box of E. orientalis. In 51 females, abdomens of 48 flies were distended or slightly distended, and those of 3 flies were not distended. A case of human dermatitis caused by a male adult fly was also reported from a survey of nesting ecology of D. major.

N2  - In Sabah and Sarawak, Malaysia, six black fly species (two known and four new) are placed in the tuberosum species-group of the subgenus Simulium (Simulium) Latreille s. str. The male, pupa and mature larva of S. (S.) aeneifacies Edwards are described for the first time, S. (S.) sabahense Smart and Clifford is revised, and all the four new species are described. All the six species are morphologically very similar to one another and endemic to Borneo, thus suggesting an intra-insular speciation which has been so far known to occur very rarely in the tuberosum species-group.

N2  - The 26 December 2004 tsunami heavily damaged many areas of Sri Lanka. Many people were forced to live in temporary housing area until February 2006, but unsanitary conditions (scattered garbage, water, etc.) related to the multiplication of Musca domestica nebulo Fabricius, 1784 in the city by seawater incursion of the tsunami had already improved. Investigations of these flies were carried out in both a temporary housing area and an unaffected village after about one year from a tsunami. Results showed that M. domestica nebulo in kitchens of temporary housing areas were more numerous than those in village areas, although no significant difference existed in a vacant lot between the areas. Attraction of M. domestica nebulo to kitchens of temporary housing areas might result from large amounts of food and raw garbage relative to those of villages. Under these circumstances, the risk of outbreak of fly-borne diseases is likely to be aggravated in temporary housing areas. This indirect damage of the tsunami to human health persists in Sri Lanka even though about one year has passed since the tsunami.

N2  - To understand the role of the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, as a hygiene insect, the adhesion rate and adhesion patterns of fungi spores on the body surface of beetles collected from indoors and outdoors were investigated. Fungi spores were isolated from 701 individuals of 988 from a total of 3,684 that were captured, and the adhesion rate of the fungi spores was 71.0%. The adhesion of fungi spores was observed on the pronotum, forewing, labrum, mandible, scutellum, abdomen, femur and tibia using a scanning electron microscope. In addition, Aspergillus sp. spores were identified and an Aspergillus sp. spore was observed on the body surface adhering to the middle of a body hair by secretion of emplastic substance. Lasioderma serricorne most likely plays a role as a carrier of fungal spores.

N2  - Simulium (Gomphostilbid) binuanense sp. nov. is described from females and pupae collected from Palawan Island, the Philippines. This new species is characterized in the female by the bare subcosta and the almost bare frons, and in the pupa by the arrangement of the eight pupal gill filaments of which the inner filament of the ventral pair is the longest and thickest of all. This new species is very similar to S. (G.) pegalanense from Sabah, Malaysia but barely distinguished by the female frons and pupal terminal hooks.

N2  - In order to clarify the existence of the autumn activity of the new generation of Haemaphysalis longicornis nymphs on floor vegetation, the seasonal activities of the nymphs, which developed outdoors in August 1999 and September 2004, were observed for a period of one year in plastic cylinders which were placed outdoors. The nymphs that developed in August 1999 showed high activity until August 2000 when they were introduced to the plastic cylinders (August 26), although activity was scarcely observed from December to March. After introduction on September 28, the activity of the nymphs that developed in September 2004 was barely observed until mid March 2005. However, the activity abruptly began in late March, and showed high activity from April to September. These results suggest that the new generation nymphs of H. longicornis that developed in summer are found on floor vegetation in the autumn, but the nymphs that developed in autumn are not. The inactivity of the new generation of the nymphs in the autumn appears to be due to behavioral diapause induced by the short days.

N2  - The hitherto unknown males of Ornithomya candida Maa, 1967 and Nycteribia pleuralis Maa, 1968 are described from Japan. Males of O. candida are distinguished from males of 0. avicularia aobatonis Matsumura by a short curved aedeagus and several external characters indicated for females by Maa (1967) such as distribution of setae on palpus, length and robustness of scutellar bristles, presence/absence of vibrissal spines and relative length of femur I to femur III. Males of N. pleuralis are similar to N. pygmaea (Kishida), but are discriminated from N. pygmaea in that both dorsal and ventral edges of parameres are straight from the lateral view in contrast to the gently curved ventral edge in the latter. Nycteribia pleuralis and N. pygmaea were collected mostly from the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and the Japanese large-footed bat (M. macrodactylus), respectively.

N2  - Host animals of the land leech Haemadipsa zeylanica var. japonica (Whitman) were investigated for 37 leeches collected in 2006 at Aonohara and Terairisawa in Kanagawa Prefecture, and a number of mammals indigenous to the forests and a human sample were analyzed in parallel by PCR-based methods using primers specific to the variable region of the 28S ribosomal RNA genes. Similarity of DNA banding patterns of leeches with wild boar, sika deer and both wild boar and sika deer were 38% (14/37), 46% (17/37) and 35% (13/37), respectively. The banding pattern of the Japanese serow was not detected in these leeches, differing from the serow as the host animal in Akita Prefecture. These results indicate that both wild boar and sika deer aid in the propagation and spread of haemadipsid leeches in Kanagawa Prefecture.

N2  - A survey of mite allergens (Der 2) derived from mite bodies and numbers of mites was conducted to estimate mite infestations in the school environment in July, 2005. A vacuum cleaner was used to collect 146 dust samples from floors and bedding in 29 primary and secondary schools in Minato Ward, Tokyo. The collected house dust was extracted with phosphate buffered saline and the supernatant was used to measure Der 2 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mites in the sediment were then isolated by the saturated saline flotation method. Only six samples (4%) from five schools exceeded the Standard Value of School Environmental Sanitation (100 mites per square meter). However, 56 of 146 samples (38%) exceeded 100 mites per gram dust, a WHO threshold for the development of IgE antibody and asthma, and 15 samples (10%) exceeded 500 mites per gram dust, another risk factor for acute attacks of asthma advocated by the WHO. Four suborders and 14 families including eight species were identified. Genus Derma-tophagoides including Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes and D. pteronyssinus (Trouessart), dominated at rates of over 90% in carpets, wooden floors and bedding. From these results, 100 Dermatophagoides mites per square meter were equivalent to 300ng of Der 2 in carpets, 210ng on wooden floors, 1,200ng in Tatami mats and 530ng in bedding. It was concluded that the Standard Value of School Environmental Sanitation was less strict than the WHO International Standard for mite allergen exposure.

N2  - To reduce the symptoms of allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma that are caused by mite allergens, we attempted to reduce the volume of mite allergens in houses over a long term by replacing the flooring and bedding. Cork flooring was substituted for tatami mats (traditional Japanese straw mats), and mite-allergen-free bed linen sets were substituted for the children's bedding. A four-year followup survey was conducted on mite allergens in the patients' houses and on clinical findings such as the value of peak respiratory flow and the number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood of the children before and after the changes in flooring and bedding. Mite allergens remained below the sensitization risk level of less than 2μg/g of fine dust recommended by The World Health Organization (WHO) over a four-year period encompassing most of the study term. The anti-mite treatments used on the floors and bedding were confirmed to be effective for reducing allergens and decreasing the symptoms of bronchial asthma.

N2  - Species composition and period of emergence were investigated for overwintering Chironomidae at the lower reaches of the Kiso River by rearing larvae to obtain fundamental information for drafting a plan to prevent outbreaks of nuisance midges. Adults of 9 species emerged from the substrate samples in February 2006. The four most abundant species, Stictochironomus akizukii, Hydrobaenus kondoi, Tanytarsus takahashii and Einfeldia dissidens, occupied 88.0% of the total abundance. Using effective accumulative temperature for emergence and in situ water temperatures, the in situ emergence periods of the overwintering generation in 2006 were predicted as until early March for H. kondoi, from the end of March to early May for S. akizukii and T. takahashii, and late April to mid-June for E. dissidens.

N2  - Aircrafts arriving at Narita International Airport, Japan were inspected for mosquito vectors of human diseases accidentally introduced into the country. During 5 years from 2001 to 2005 a total of 2, 161 aircrafts were inspected and 28 adult mosquitoes were found from 26 (1.2%) of the aircrafts. Thirteen aircrafts with mosquitoes came from North and South America, 12 aircrafts from Asia and Oceania, and one aircraft from Europe. The mosquito species found in the aircrafts were Culex pipiens complex, Anopheles sinensis, Aedes vexans nipponii, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Mosquito species occurring at the government ordinance area of Narita International Airport were examined by dipping collection of larvae, ovitraps, light traps, and dry ice traps, and identified into 12 taxa belonging to 8 genera. In the terminal building of Narita International Airport, adults Cx. pipiens complex were collected year round suggesting the establishment of foreign vector mosquitoes accidentally introduced from tropical/subtropical areas through aircrafts. All of 15, 231 adult mosquitoes examined were negative for 5 mosquito-borne diseases ; yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever, and malaria.

N2  - Prevalence of house dust mites and allergens was evaluated in ten kindergartens/elementary schools in Kanagawa Prefecture during school suspension periods in March and August, 2006. The mites on the surface of the infirmary bedding and classroom carpet (50cm×50cm) were captured with an adhesive lint roller. Thereafter the numbers of mites on the adhesive papers were counted under a stereomicroscope. House dust was also collected with a vacuum cleaner, and the quantities of house dust mite allergens (Der f1/Der p1/Der 2) measured by ELISA. Mean numbers of mites obtained from bedding-March and August, carpet-March and August were 23, 97, 13, 173/m^2, respectively. Mean allergen quantities of Der 1 were 933, 3, 168, 1, 900, 3, 457ng/m^2, and Der 2 were 65, 208, 118, 284 ng/m2. The quantities of Der f1 were much higher than Der p1 in the total Der 1. Consequently, 100 house dust mites (Dermatophagoides spp.) per square meter were equivalent to 3, 700 and 1, 800ng (Der 1)/m^2 for bedding and carpet.

N2  - A total of 566 individuals of droneflies belonging to 3 genera and 5 species emerged from manure and effluent of manure as a breeding media in Ebetsu and Shizunai, Hokkaido, Japan. Of these species, Eristalis (Eoseristalis) cerealis Fabricius was the predominant species, followed by Eristalis (Eristalis} tenax (Linnaeus), Helophilus (Helophilus) virgatus Coquillett, Eristalis (Eoseristalis) rossica Stackelberg and Eristalinus (Lathyrophthalmus) tarsalis (Macquart). The eggs of the five species examined showed little differences, but the units on the egg shell surface of H. virgatus were glabrous and differed from the other four excavation formed species. It was determined that the shape, arrangement and number of sensilla, proleg, crochets, spine of 7th proleg and lappets are the useful characteristics for identifying the 3rd instar larvae. Distinct differences were observed on the shape of the anterior spiracles, and the shape and length of thoracic respirator process in pupae. A key to the 3rd instar larvae of dronefly species occurring from the effluent of manure in Hokkaido is provided.

N2  - The efficacy of etoxazole emulsifiable concentrate (etoxazole EC) which has insect growth regulatory activity against Dermanyssus gallinae, was studied in laboratory. Etoxazole EC did not show acaricidal effects against adult mites. At 2,500-fold or less dilution rates, etoxazole EC showed inhibitiory effects on hatchability of eggs and molting to the first instar nymphs. Hatchability and molting rate were less than 30% and 0%, respectively. All of the hatched larvae died within one or two days after hatching. The efficacy of etoxazole EC against D. gallinae lasted for at least five months after treatment in the laboratory conditions. The same experiment of etoxazole EC was carried out against D. gallinae collected at two different locations to examine the location-related difference in efficacy, and almost similar results were obtained. The above results suggest that etoxazole EC will be an effective agent in controlling D. gallinae.

N2  - An ovi-trap collection was made weekly both indoors and outdoors on three islands of the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan, from May 2002 to May 2003. The total number of mosquito eggs collected from each of the islands was 17,757 in Okinawa, 11,190 in Ishigaki and 28, 375 in Yonaguni. More than 99% of the pupae and adults emerging from the eggs were Aedes albopictus, while the rest were Ochlerotatus togoi. There were no Ae. aegypti eggs confirmed. Oviposition of Ae. albopictus was interrupted by heavy rains and typhoons but continued soon after weather recovery. No eggs were collected in January in Okinawa Is., but eggs were found even in winter in Ishigaki Is. and Yonaguni Is., although the number of eggs was small. Aedes albopictus oviposited more eggs in ovi-traps outdoors than indoors. The low hatching rates of Ae. albopictus eggs during winter in Okinawa Is. in spite of high embryonation rates suggest light dormant eggs. The egg biology of Ae. albopictus in the subtropical region is discussed.

N2  - We bred 20 adults of female Dermatophagoides farinae with 5 g of house-dust samples, and measured periodically the mite density and the amount of mite allergen. In most of the house-dust samples, the mite density increased exponentially, followed by a rapid increase of the allergen, especially Der fl which was originated from mite feces. In a house-dust sample which was rich in nutrients for mites, the number of mites increased more than 2,000 times that of the initial density (4 mites per gram of fine dust) after 15-week breeding, and the Der fl reached over 780,000 ng per gram of fine dust after 20-week breeding. This increase of the mite density was greater than that reported on other nutritious culture media, such as mixtures of dried yeast, powdered fish, etc. Another house-dust sample collected from a vacant house gave a very little increase of the number of mites and the allergen, showing low nutritive value. By adding human dander/skin scales to this sample, good propagation of the mites and a rapid increase of the allergen could be obtained. It was concluded that house-dust and human dander/skin scales were nutritious enough for mites to produce a large amount of mite allergen.

N2  - Eight species of black flies including two new and four newly recorded ones were collected from Mindoro Island, the Philippines. One of the two new species, Simulium (Gomphostilbia) mindoroense sp. nov., described from the adults, pupae and mature larvae, represents the first species of the ceylonicum species-group so far recorded from the Philippines, and the second, S. (Simulium} halconense sp. nov., described from the adult female and pupa, is assigned to the melanopus species-group. Four species newly recorded from Mindoro Island are S. (S.) baltazarae Delfinado, S. (S.) taalense Takaoka, S. (Wallacellum) suyoense Takaoka and S. (W.) tuyense Takaoka.

N2  - Influence of pheromone trap (New Serrico[R!○]) location on the capture of cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, was studied in the feed processing plant in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan in 2003. Traps on the walls captui ed more beetles than traps apart from the wall. Traps on the 'web' of H-shape steel captured more beetles than 'flange'. But this result was not based on the difference between structure of 'web' and 'flange'. Because the areas of 'web' were larger than those of 'flange', and the number of beetles captured was not significantly different between traps placed on imitation models of 'web' and 'flange' made by same area (1,680 cm^2) cardboards. Thus, it was indicated that the pheromone traps placed on the wide flat area could capture more beetles than the trap located in space or on the smaller flat area, and this may be explained by the behavior of the cigarette beetle: it approaches the pheromone trap by flying and makes landing near the trap, and after landing it enters to the trap by crawling.

N2  - We characterized mosquito larvicidal activities associated with the three Vietnamese Bacillus thuringiensis soil isolates designated V-61-25 (H34, serovar konkukian), V-88-47 (H21, serovar colmeri), and. V-93-38 (H34, serovar konkukiari). Spore/parasporal inclusion mixtures of the three isolates induced significant larval mortalities against three species of the mosquito; Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex pipiens molestus and the moth-fly, Telmatoscopus albipunctatus. In particular, V-93-38 exhibited high mosquitocidal activities, comparable to that of the reference strain of B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis (H14). The activities of the two other isolates were 25-50 times lower than that of V-93-38, when tested on Ae. aegypti. The isolate V-93-38 differed from the israelensis strain in lacking the gene cry4A, although certain similarities were evident between the two in SDS-PAGE profiles of solubilized parasporal proteins and in Ouchterlony immunodiffusion tests.

N2  - Blood-sucking arthropods including mosquitoes, sand flies and ticks transmit numerous infectious agents during blood feeding. Amongst arthropodborn diseases, malaria transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes is the worst health problem in the world, and kills 1-2 million people, mostly African children, every year. The lack of an effective vaccine and the emergence of Plasmodium resistance to many existing antimalarial drugs have aggravated the situation. Therefore, the control of vector competence in malaria transmission has become a more important objective to be pursued. Recent advances in the genetic engineering of anopheline mosquitoes have raised hopes for their use as new strategies for malaria control and provided a powerful tool to investigate mosquito-parasite interactions. The interruption of the parasite cycle in the mosquito using transgenic strategies can occur at the midgut level, interfering with ookinete invasion or oocyst differentiation, and at the salivary gland level, blocking invasion of gland cells or the transmission of infective sporozoites from the salivary glands. We have established two kinds of transgenic mosquitoes expressing foreign genes at midguts or salivary glands. This review describes recent progress of our transgenic mosquito works. Our results open up the possibilities of elucidating mosquito-parasite interactions and generating transgenic mosquitoes refractory to parasites.

N2  - Entomological surveys were done as a part of a malaria control project at nine sites in East Sepik Province. Adult mosquitoes were collected by the humanbait method and the number of anopheline mosquitoes by 177 night×people collections was 3,631. Species identification was done by the PCR-RFLP method at the ITS 2 region of the rDNA. Five kinds of anopheline mosquitoes, i.e., Anopheles farauti 1, An. farauti 2, An. farauti 4, An. koliensis and An. punctulatus were identified. Anopheles koliensis was the most common, then An. punctulatus, An. farauti 1, and followed by An. farauti 4 and An. farauti 2. Anopheles farauti 1 was distributed mainly in coastal areas and An. farauti 2 in inland areas. Anopheles farauti 4 was found only in Kairiru Island and this is the first report of the distribution of this species in an island. Anopheles koliensis and An. punctulatus were widely distributed throughout the districts; however, the distribution of An. koliensis was sporadic. Negative correlations were found between the collected numbers of An. farauti 1 and An. farauti 2 and those of An. koliensis and An. punctulatus.

N2  - We attempted to detect Rickettsia japonica DNA from ixodid ticks by the PCR analysis. Ixodid ticks were collected at Hami, Minamikata and Shintomi of Kimotsuki Town, Kagoshima Prefecture. Ixodid ticks were also collected at three popular camp sites, Sarugajou Gorge in Tarumizu City, Kamikawaotaki Park and Shouyojunomori in Kinkou Town, Kagoshima Prefecture. A total of 3,477 ixodid ticks was collected. They were identified as four genera and eight species as follows: Haemaphysalis flava, H. longicornis, H. formosensis, H. hystricis, Ixodes nipponensis, I. ovatus, Amblyomma testudinarium and Dermacentor taiwanensis. Haemaphysalis formosensis and H. flava seemed to be the dominant species in the survey areas. The nucleotide sequence of PCR products with a primer pair Rj5 and Rj10 was analyzed. The nucleotide sequences of four PCR products from H. longicornis (one sample), H. formosensis (one sample) and H. hystricis (two samples) were successfully decided, and their sequences accorded with Rickettsia japonica DNA.

N2  - In Japan, the invasion of the West Nile virus (WNV) has not been reported. However, in order to develop a rapid- and sensitive-detection system for WNV, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), TaqMan RT-PCR, and VecTest^<TM> WNV assays were evaluated. VecTest^<TM> produced results within 1 hour and no specialized training was required. However it showed the lowest sensitivity to detect WNV (> 10^5 plaque-forming units; PFU/tube) and was costly. The TaqMan RT-PCR assay was the highest sensitive assay (>0.25 PFU/tube) and was followed by the RT-PCR assay (>20 PFU/tube), although it took 10 hours for investigators to get the results of both assays and their protocols are more complex than that of the VecTest^<TM>. In addition, TaqMan RT-PCR is simpler than RT-PCR. These results suggest that the TaqMan RT-PCR assay may be the most effective for WNV survey at present in Japan. We hereby recommend one of the most preferable WNV surveillance systems at present in Japan as follows. First, the mosquito pool supernatants are screened for the presence of WN viral RNA by using the TaqMan RT-PCR assay with WNV primer-probe sets. Second, the viral RNA-positive pools are used for the virus isolation using cell culture assay. Finally, the isolated viruses are characterized for the viral genome by using molecular biological techniques.

N2  - Fenitrothion and permethrin are common insecticides for controlling veterinary insect pests in Japan. The efficacy of these two insecticides to the blow fly, Calliphora nigribarbis, was investigated, because the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus was detected and isolated from blow flies collected in the vicinity of an infected poultry farm in Kyoto Prefecture in 2004. The adult blow flies collected in Yamaguchi Prefecture, where the first HPAI outbreak occurred in 2004, were directly used for topical application. The LD_<50> values were 0.078μg/female for fenitrothion and 0.014μg/female for permethrin. The results show that the local population of the blow fly was susceptible to these two insecticides.

N2  - Adult mosquitoes were collected at neighboring and surrounding areas of Narita International Airport, Japan in 2003 and 2004, and the samples were checked for the West Nile virus. One area beside Narita International Airport and three areas, 8, 14 or 18km from the airport, were selected for the mosquito collections. In each area 10 CDC-like suction traps enhanced with 1kg of dry-ice were used to collect host-seeking mosquitoes. During the two-year survey a total of 5,882 females of 16 mosquito species in seven genera were collected and all samples were negative for the West Nile virus. There were significant differences in species composition of the mosquitoes among the study areas. The variation in mosquito numbers among 10 traps that were distributed at the same study area was analyzed. The trap site where the largest number of mosquitoes was recorded differed seasonally. The result of mosquito collection was compared between two different collection methods, dry-ice trap and sweeping, and the resting behavior of adult mosquitoes was discussed.

N2  - Two cases of Sarcophaga myiasis were found in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. In the first case, larvae were removed from a trichophytosis sore at the root of the toes on the right foot of a 77-yr-old woman confined to bed in a hospital and were reared in our laboratory. The adult flies which emerged were identified as S. peregrina Robineau-Desvoidy on the basis of the characteristics of adult flies. This indicates a hospital-acquired myiasis. In the second case, one larva was removed from a post-surgical wound in the face of a 72-yr-old man convalescing in his home after resection of genyantrum cancer and was reared in the laboratory; the one adult fly which emerged was identified as S. crassipalpis Macquart. The definition of myiasis is discussed and clinical characteristics of patients with wound myiases in Japan are summarized.

N2  - Resistance level to warfarin was evaluated among 3 colonies of brown rats, Rattus norvegicus, collected in Aomori, Shinjuku and Yokohama. Flourtype baits containing 0.005% (w/w) warfarin were given to them for 12 days. The average survived dose (a.i.) in the Aomori colony was 40.7mg/kg. On the other hand, the lethal days and dose in brown rats were 7 days and 5.7mg/kg in the Shinjuku colony, 4 days and 6.7mg/kg in the Yokohama colony, respectively. Therefore, the Aomori colony was judged as resistant to warfarin, and this is the first case in Japan. On the other hand, the Shinjuku and Yokohama colonies were judged as susceptible to warfarin.

N2  - In order to clarify the seasons of the alternation of the new and old generations, the seasonal activities of Haemaphysalis flava nymphs, which were collected monthly from the field, were observed in plastic cylinders placed outdoors. The activities of the field-collected nymphs in May 2004, March and April 2005 were high until June after they were introduced into the plastic cylinders. However, the activities decreased in July and were scarcely observed in August. The activity of the field-collected nymphs in June 2004 was observed until December after introduction, but there were few active nymphs. The activities of the field-collected nymphs in July and August were high until October or November after introduction. Furthermore, active nymphs were observed even in the following spring, although these were few. The activity of the field-collected nymphs in September was similar to those of the nymphs in July and August. The activities of the field-collected nymphs in October and November were high until the following spring (May) after introduction, although the nymphs temporarily decreased their activity in January. The activities of the field-collected nymphs in December, January, and February were similar to those of the nymphs in the autumn (October and November). These results suggest that the participation of the new generation of H. flava nymphs occurs in two seasons; summer and autumn. The new generations in summer and autumn probably begin to climb floor vegetation in June and October, respectively, and all die in June and August/September of the next year.

N2  - Mosquitoes were collected by using dry-ice traps at urban areas surrounding Tokyo, Japan, in 2003 and 2004. Twelve and 18 collection sites were selected beside human houses in 2003 and 2004, respectively, and a battery-operated suction trap with 1kg of dry-ice was operated weekly for 24hr. A total of 6 mosquito species were collected, and among them the Culex pipiens group and Aedes albopictus were the dominant species in the study areas. The average number of collected females /trap/day for Cx. pipiens gr. and Ae. albopictus was 7.4 and 1.8 in 2003, and 9.4 and 2.0 in 2004, respectively. A large variation in the number of the collected mosquitoes was found among the collection sites. Aedes albopictus was collected from May to October, while Cx. pipiens gr. was found from April to December. To distinguish females of Cx. pipiens pallens and autogenous Cx. pipiens pipiens, the ommatidial number of the collected females was examined, and autogenous Cx. pipiens pipiens was found from all the collection sites. Culex pipiens pallens, autogenous Cx. pipiens pipiens and Ae. albopictus were considered to be potential vectors of the West Nile virus at urban areas surrounding Tokyo, Japan.

N2  - Host-seeking mosquitoes were collected by CDC-type traps enhanced with 1kg of dry-ice and human bait collection in August 2003 and August 2004 at 6 localities along the coastal region of the eastern part of Hokkaido, Japan. A total of 10 species in 5 genera was encountered, and Culex pipiens s.l. and subarctic aedine mosquitoes were abundant. The mosquito fauna was compared between localities and among collection sites with different vegetation type. The species composition of mosquito samples differed greatly between localities. There was a clear relationship between species composition and vegetation type in Kushiro, suggesting a species-specific habitat selection among the 4 dominant species; Cx. pipiens s. l., Aedes esoensis, Culiseta nipponica and Ae. yamadai. The potential vectors of the West Nile virus in the eastern part of Hokkaido, Japan, were discussed based on the results of our mosquito collections.

N2  - Stability of nucleic acids in the body louse preserved under several conditions was investigated in order to explore the ideal stock method of the human louse for molecular diagnosis. The partial DNA sequence of the para-orthologous sodium channel, which is the target site of pyrethroid insecticide, was amplified by utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the stability of genomic DNA and poly (A)^+ RNA in dead insects was evaluated. Overall, poly (A)^+ RNA was less stable than the genomic DNA even if lice were stored in 70% or in absolute ethanol. Stability of genomic DNA lasted for at least two months when the lice were fixed in 99.5% ethanol or even in the lice which died of starvation at room temperature without any treatment. On the contrary, apparent degradation of genomic DNA and poly(A)^+ RNA was observed for lice, which were killed with vapor of diethyl ether, suggesting that the moisture or blood in the body of louse needs to be dried out or digested naturally before storing insects for molecular analysis.

N2  - The survival, development, emergence and effect on water quality of the common Japanese chironomid, Chironomus yoshimatsui, were examined under different combinations of food dose and larval density in a container (φ15×H 9cm). Emergence rate was higher than 80% in a combination of 5g dose and 100 ind. density. Mean adult weight was about 0.7mg or higher than 0.7mg in 10g dose. Total survival rate was higher than 50% in the combinations of 2.5g and 100 ind. and 5g and 100 or 200 ind. Reduction in PO_4-P concentration of the rearing water was higher than 20% in the combinations of 2.5g and 100 ind. and 5g and 200 ind. About 50% or higher than 50% of reduction in protein concentration was obtained at 5 or 10g dose. The results suggest that there is a possibility of improving water quality by cultivating this species in waste water.

N2  - Plethysmochaeta nobilis hitherto known from Java was discovered in Fukuoka and Tokorozawa, Japan. Morphological characters of the specimens obtained in Japan are briefly described, and a key to morphologically similar phorid species in the lowland of Japan is given. In Fukuoka, P. nobilis was caught by sweeping at a park where thousands of crows gathered and the ground was covered with their droppings. In Tokorozawa, it was collected by traps baited with decaying meat. The genus Plethysmochaeta is saprophagous in the larval stage and has been known from Africa and Southeast Asia. It is possible that P. nobilis was transported to Japan by human activity, judging from its food preference and known locality of the genus. It is also possible that P. nobilis is native to Japan at least in the southern region, and the lack of its distribution record in the past is due to limited investigation on the phorids in Japan.

N2  - A 74-year-old woman, who has been suffering from type II diabetes with insulin therapy, was found infested with around 5mm-long maggots in her oral cavity in a general hospital in Shimane Prefecture, Japan. The maggots were identified as Boettcherisca septentrionalis Rohdendorf, 1937 from their morphological characteristics of the emerged adult fly. This is the first myiasis case caused by B. septentrionalis. She also had a past history of myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction. She underwent left femoral amputation due to left femoral artery embolism. The present case revealed that the patient had many predisposing factors for acquiring myiasis.

N2  - Simulium (Boreosimulium) tokachiense sp. nov. is described on the basis of adults, pupae and mature larvae collected in Tokachi, Hokkaido, Japan. This is the second species of the subgenus Boreosimulium from Japan, and is most similar to S. (B.) balteatum described from North America by having the paramere with one medial and three apical hooks, the style with the dorsomesal margin bulged, and the pupal gill with the dorsal stalk branching near the middle of the gill. However, this new species is distinguished in the pupa by the gill with the ventral stalk very short and in the larva by the antenna without hyaline bands and the abdomen with a weakly colored transverse band on each segment.

N2  - Simulium (Asiosimulium) wanchaii sp. nov. is described based on females, collected from a human bait by a hand net in Doi Pui National Park, northern Thailand. This is the second species assigned to the subgenus Simulium (Asiosimulium), and is very similar to S. (A.) oblongum Takaoka and Choochote but is easily distinguished from the latter by the cercus 1.2 times as long as its basal width and the genital fork without an incision at the base of its arms.

N2  - Two species of deer keds, Lipoptena fortisetosa Maa and L. sikae Mogi, were collected from Miyajima, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. This is the first report of L. fortisetosa from Hiroshima Prefecture and for L. sikae from the Chugoku district. Alate individuals of L. fortisetosa were collected during June-October by sweeping; L. sikae were similarly collected in November. Both sexes of L. fortisetosa often flitted at a low height (5-110cm above the ground), and sometimes adhered to the outside of the white sweep nets. Apparently, the population density of winged L. fortisetosa is unrelated to that of the Japanese deer Cervus nippon Temminck. In late December, de-alate forms of both species were collected from the body of the dead host. Lipoptena fortisetosa were collected during winter in Japan for the first time. Attention should be paid to deer keds in Miyajima, since they are potential pests for humans. Miyajima can be a valuable field for studying interspecific relationships of these two species of deer keds.

N2  - In July 2002, family members discovered that the left orbital socket of a 66-year-old severely mentally retarded woman was empty and therefore took her to the emergency outpatient division of a general hospital in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. The patient had erosion and inflammation of the left eyelid since March 2002. She had not received doctor's consultation until this episode happened. The eyelid lesion was diagnosed histopathologically as sebaceous gland carcinoma. Physical examination revealed that 3rd instar larvae of the Family Calliphoridae were present in the orbital socket. The attending physician (K. S.) confirmed that the left orbit was absent. The maggots were reared to adults and identified as Lucilia sericata.

N2  - The seasonal abundance and daily flying activity of adult black flies were investigated at four different altitudes (400m, 860m, 1,360m and 2,460m) in Doi Inthanon National Park, northern Thailand. Collections were carried out at each altitude twice a month from 0600 to 1800 hours from August 2003 to July 2004, and adult black flies attracted to a human bait were captured by a hand net. The numbers of black flies collected were 2,599, 24,010, 7,996 and 4,496 at altitudes of 400m, 860m, 1,360m and 2,460m, respectively. A total of 39,101 adult black flies comprising 39,060 females, 37 males and 4 sex mosaics of 23 species of the genus Simulium Latreille s. l. were identified. Simuliid species composition and abundance varied according to altitude. Three species, i.e., S. (Gomphostilbia) asakoae Takaoka and Davies, S. (Simulium) rufibasis Brunetti and S. (S.) nigrogilvum Summers, were regularly attracted to a human bait in this order of predominance. Simulium (G.) asakoae was captured from low to medium altitudes, while S. (S.) rufibasis was captured mostly at high altitude, and S. (S.) nigrogilvum at medium altitudes. The seasonal patterns in abundance of all these predominant species varied among species even at the same altitudes and also by altitude even within the same species. Daily flying activities of these three predominant species differed in patterns and in peak hours by altitudes, by species, and also by seasons. Those of S. (G.) asakoae were similar in all seasons showing essentially a bimodal pattern with the first peak early in the morning and the second in the late afternoon, or vice versa; while S. (S.) nigrogilvum and S. (S.) rufibasis showed uni-, bi- and trimodal daily flying patterns. Five species, i.e., S. (G.) asakoae, S. (S.) chamlongi Takaoka and Suzuki, S. (S.) nigrogilvum, S. (S.) nodosum Puri and S. (S.) rufibasis, were confirmed to bite human beings.

N2  - Mosquito larval surveys were carried out on Yap Islands in October and November 1999. Larvae were collected from 60 natural and artificial habitats. A total of 723 larvae belonging to 10 species including two unidentified species were collected. Among them, Aedes hensilli was the most predominant species collected (70.0%) followed by Ae. maehleri (13.4%), Ae. lamelliferus (8.4%) and Culex quinquefasciatus (4.8%). The same surveys were also carried out at 56 larval habitats on four inhabited islands of Ulithi Atoll (Mogmog, Falarop, Asor and Fassarai) in October 2001. A total of 658 larvae were collected from 56 habitats on the islands. Two mosquito species, Ae. hensilli (71.9%) and Cx. quiquefasciatus (28.1%) were collected from 51 and 9 habitats, respectively. Since Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were not collected in the present survey, Ae. hensilli may be implicated as a putative dengue vector in case of an outbreak. Two species, Cx. annulirostris and Ae. lamelliferus were newly recorded species from Yap Islands.

N2  - In September 2002, a 78-year-old woman who had received surgical operation of dissecting aneurysm was admitted to a general hospital. She was of comatose status and was admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital. An attending nurse of the patient found numerous wiggling maggots with body length of 5mm from her nasal and oral cavities in early October. Maggots were identified as the second-instar larvae of Sarcophaga peregrina from the morphological characteristics of the larva and emerged male adult. The admission date to the ICU was more than 10 days prior to the discovery of 5mm long S. peregrina larvae. Therefore, this myiasis happened definitively inside the ICU.

N2  - The effects of antiparasitic drug, ivermectin, on the dung-breeding flies were studied in laboratory and field experiments in Hokkaido, Japan. In two pour-on treatments (500μg/kg), ivermectin was excreted in dung for up to 14 and 21 days after treatment, with peaks at 3 days and 1 day, respectively. Dung from treated cattle prevented the larval development of Haematobia irritans and Neomyia cornicina up to 14 days and reduced the larval and pupal survival rates at 21 days after treatment. In the field experiment using emergence traps, the numbers of emerged flies from dung pats were 3,655 (18 families) in control dung and 2,234 (16 families) in treated dung. Especially, Musca bezzii, Ravinia striata, Sepsis duplicata, Sepsis thoracica, Sepsis cynipsea, Sphaeroceridea, Empididae, Sciaridae and Chironomidae were severely reduced in treated dung. Reduction of cyclorrhaphaous flies similarly occurred at 1, 3 and 7 days after treatment, which coincides with high concentrations of ivermectin. Conversely, Ceratopogonidae and Phoridae increased in treated dung, regardless of days (1, 3 and 7) after treatment. Dry weights of flies emerged from dung pats of treated cattle in the field experiment were only 5.8% of those from dung of control cattle, indicating that dung-decomposing activity by fly larvae was supressed in dung of treated cattle.

N2  - For identification of four sibling species of the Anopheles hyrcanus complex found in Korea, the 5.8 rDNA-ITS2-28S rDNA region of each species was sequenced and the species-specific primers were designed. The amplified PCR products obtained from each species were analyzed by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel. The result showed a single species-specific band, i.e. 559bp, 432bp, 322bp and 192bp for An. sinensis, An. sp., An. lesteri and An. pullus, respectively. In conclusion, the species-specific PCR primers designed from ITS2 variable regions functioned successfully and specifically, and can be applied as a useful tool for identifying species of the Hyrcanus complex found in Korea.

N2  - Mosquito collections were made in Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Archipelago in May 1990 and 7 species were identified. Culex mimeticus is a new record for Chichi-jima. The larva of Cx. boninensis was found commonly in ground pools and artificial containers around the dwellings and it was easily colonized in the laboratory. Culex boninensis was stenogamous; copulation took place easily on the wall of a small plastic container (3cm diameter×5cm deep) and it fed easily on chicken, Mongolian gerbil and mouse in this order. Mating took place 8 hours after emergence of both sexes in the container. The insemination rate of the females in the container was about 90%, 2 days after emergence. A mature male copulated with 7-16 mature females in the container during a 24-hr period. The same experiments were carried out for Cx. quinquefasciatus collected in Chichi-jima for comparison.

N2  - A nurse of a certain general hospital who had eaten a box lunch, it found numerous wriggling maggots beneath a slice of baked salmon. She immediately ceased ingestion of the salmon, but some of the food with maggots might have already been swallowed. But she did not complain of any abdominal symptoms and signs during the following several days. The collected larvae were identified as 2nd instar larvae of Lucilia sericata from their morphological characteristics.

N2  - A 78-year-old woman, who was admitted to a hospital in Tochigi Prefecture, was found to be infested with maggots around her perineal region in June, 2001. The patient suffered from cerebral infarction and had undergone amputation of her right leg. There was also inflammation and purulent matter around the vulvovaginal lesion. Therefore, this attracted the female sarcophagid fly to deposit larvae around the perineum of the patient. The number of larvae collected from the vagina was 3; and their body length was around 10mm. Larvae collected were identified as Sarcophaga peregrina as a result of adult examination. The present case occurred on a mentally healthy woman whose consciousness was clear, but had physical handicaps, i.e. cerebral infarction and leg amputation.

N2  - In July 5, 2004, a 59-year-old man who suffered head contusion in a fall accident was admitted to a general hospital. Computed tomography revealed intracranial left temporal to occipital hemorrhage and bilateral frontal lobe contusion. Then he was admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at 9:55 p.m., July 5. In the morning of July 9, the attending surgeon found some 50 maggots with body length of 10mm from his oral cavity (mainly in his pharynx and larynx). The maggots were identified as the 3rd-instar larvae of Lucilia sericata. The duration between admission to ICU and the discovery of 10mm long L. sericata larvae was three and a half days. Therefore, there was room for discussion whether deposition of eggs by this causative fly was inside or outside ICU.

N2  - Mosquito collections were made at two foothill sites of Iriomote Island, the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan, by modified CDC miniature light traps with a frog call CD player from June 12 to 18, 2004. A total of 777 and 257 female Diptera was collected at sites 1 and 2, respectively. Among them, 4 haematophagous species were predominant at sites 1 and 2-Uranotaenia macfarlanei with 580 (74.6%) and 193 (75.1%) individuals respectively, Ur. yaeyamana 19 (2.4%) and 27 (10.5%), and Corethrella nippon 106 (13.6%) and 20 (7.8%) which is a new record for Iriomote Island, and Mimomyia luzonensis with 39 (5.0%) individuals was predominant at site 1. The females of these species collected by the traps fed easily on a frog, Rana limnocharis exposed in the cage. The results demonstrated clearly that frog call is the primary stimulus in guiding these Culicine and Chaoborine flies in their search for host animals in nature.

N2  - The holotype of Sarcophaga asahinai Kano, 1962, which is now preserved in the National Science Museum, Tokyo, is examined and considered to be an aberrant male having vestigial aedeagus. The redescription was made based on the normal form found in the sarcophagid collections made by the late Dr. R. Kano on the same date in the same place as the holotype. The male genitalia of normal form are illustrated and compared with those of the related species of Myorhina Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 subgenus Bellieriomima Rohdendorf, 1937. Myorhina (Bellieriomima) asahinai seems to be indigenous to Okinawa-Honto I. and very similar to Myorhina uniseta (Baranov, 1939) from the mainlands of Japan, but the detailed examination of male genitalia can distinguish both species. Dysparaphalla Rohdendorf, 1965 syn. n., which was proposed as a generic name for this species, becomes a junior synonym of Bellieriomima Rohdendorf, 1937.

N2  - The host animals of land leech Haemadipsa zeylanica var. japonica (Whitman) were surveyed among nine common mammals in forests and a human by the single strand conformation polymorphism of PCR products of the variable region in the 28S rRNA genes. When the leeches collected in 1995, 1996 and 2000 at Gojome-machi in Akita Prefecture were analyzed, the same banding patterns between the collected leeches and blood samples of the reference animals were only observed in the Japanese serow and copper pheasant or pheasant. The leeches collected in 1995 showed the highest resemblance rate with the serow and it was 86% (25/29), while the leeches collected in 1996 and 2000 showed 34% (11/32) and 12% (14/114), resemblance rate respectively. On the other hand, only a few numbers of leeches showed the same banding pattern with the copper pheasant or pheasant. These results indicate that the Japanese serow contributes to the propagation and spread of the leech in Akita Prefecture.

N2  - The number and species of triatomine bugs collected in houses in the State of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where Chagas disease infection from mothers to infants is frequently reported, and the infection rate of Trypanosoma cruz in bugs are shown in this study. The result was that large numbers of Triatoma infestans were collected indoors, their infection rate of T. cruzi is extremely high, an average of 80.5%; suggesting that the infection cycle of Chagas disease occurs indoors. In addition, because the T. cruzi-IgG antibody-positive rate for humans in this region is also high at 84.0%, residents are surmised to be in danger of constant infection. In contrast, there are almost no triatomine bugs in dwellings in the northeastern portion of Brazil where infection from mothers to infants has not been reported; triatomine bugs were found only in sheds for animals. However, these triatomine bugs are zoophilic (e.g., feeding on birds) and their infection rate with T. cruzi was extremely low, so the risk of Chagas disease is thought to be extremely low.

N2  - A total of 131 female adults of seven black-fly species were captured in nine collections inside a bear shed in Kuju, Oita Prefecture, southwestern Japan, from May to August of 2000. Two bears in cages were used as attractants. Simulium (Nevermannia) uchidai (Takahasi) was the most abundant species followed by S. (Simulium) aokii (Takahasi), S. (S.) bidentatum (Shiraki) and S. (S.) nikkoense Shiraki. Natural infections with larvae of an unknown filaria species were found in five of 52 S. (N.) uchidai dissected. The number of larvae per infected fly ranged from 5 to 115. The infective larvae measured 490-590μm long by 16-19 μm wide which resembled those of Splendidofilaria, a genus parasitic in birds. This is the first report of a natural filarial infection in a species of the subgenus Simulium (Nevermannia).

This fly species was reared most often from a macrofungal species belonging to the families of Russulaceae, Amanitaceae and Boletaceae that produce large fruit-bodies. The fly emerged from June to September with a peak in July, synchronizing its appearance period with that of the host macrofungi.

N2  - Ethanol extracts of some herbs showed strong repellency against the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, under laboratory conditions. Extracts of thirty-three herb species were applied to the surface of cockroach harborages made of 5cm×5cm plywood panels with a 5-mm single void. The majority (90% or more) of cockroach feces was deposited in non-treated harborages when an extract among dill (Anethum graveolens), celery (Apium graveolens), caraway (Carum carvi), cumin (Cuminum cymimum), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), cinnamon (Cinamomum zeylanicum), mace (Myristica fragrans) and chili pepper (Capsicum annuum) was treated on the other side of the harborage in the same arena. The repellent efficacy was sustained with all the above extracts for at least one month, and caraway, cinnamon, chili pepper and celery were effective at 80 times dilution with water. The herbs, anis (Pimpinella anisum), sansyo (Zathoxylum piperitum), onion (Allium cepa), vanilla (Vanilla planifolia), mustard (Brassica hirta) and eucalypt (Eucalyptus radiata), showed an attractant effect to the German cockroach by the same method.

N2  - A new black-fly species, Simulium (Nevermannia) artum sp. nov., is described based on male, female (dissected out of pupa), pupal and larval specimens collected from Tochigi and Hokkaido, Japan. This new species is assigned to the vernum species-group and appears to be most closely related to S. subcostatum (Takahasi) in that it has a combination of the following characters; katepisternum bare, female genital fork without any projection directed anteriorly on each arm, pupal frons with three long trichomes on each side, cocoon simple, and larval rectal organ with 0-2 secondary lobules on each lobe. However, S. artum is easily distinguished from S. subcostatum and other known related species by the pupal gill with four long slender filaments usually arising together at the same level from the very short common basal stalk.

(M.) surachaii sp. nov., are described based on specimens collected at high elevation (2,560m above sea level) in Doi Inthanon National Park, Northern Thailand. Simulium (M.) merga sp. nov. (known for female, male, pupa and mature larva) is distinguished from all the known species of the subgenus by the large paired elements of the pupal gill with 14 slender filaments. Simulium (M.) surachaii sp. nov. (only the female adult is known) is easily distinguished from S. (M.) merga by the much smaller claw tooth.

This new species is characterized by the genitalia of both sexes, especially the elongated cercus in the female and the absence of parameral hooks in the male; the pupal gill with a dendroid type of 31-33 slender filaments; the larval antenna subequal in length to the stem of the labral fan. Based on a combination of these distinctive characteristics observed in this new species, a new subgenus, Asiosimulium, is proposed within the genus Simulium s. l.

N2  - Abstract : In order to clarify whether or not Haemaphysalis flava adults found on vegetation in the summer include a new generation, the activities of the field-collected adults in June 2001, July 2003, and October 2003 were observed in plastic cylinders that were placed outdoors. Haemaphysalis flava adults collected in June and July actively climbed the plastic cylinders immediately after they were released (June and July). However, the activities decreased sharply from the summer and were scarcely observed from the autumn to the following spring (May). Haemaphysalis flava adults collected in October actively climbed the plastic cylinders until the following spring after release (October). Since the new generation of H. flava adults is active until the following spring, these results suggest that the field-collected adults in summer do not include a new generation but those collected in autumn do. The new generation of H. flava adults appears to commence the activity in autumn.

N2  - Recent infestation of roof rats in urban areas has caused serious problems among old people who need social welfare services. A questionnaire to care workers in Tokyo revealed cases of old people bitten by rats. Our examination of one of these cases showed that it had been caused by a roof rat. Care workers also claimed in the questionnaire that rooms had been fouled with droppings, residents had been bitten by rat mites, and rat noise disturbed their sleep at night.

N2  - I discussed the relationshps between harming mechanisms and feeding behavior such as commensalism, food habits, water requirements and responses to starbation in Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, R. exulans and Mus musculus. Because of their commensalism they seasonally migrate between houses and the outdoors, and accidentally bring pathogens into houses. R. norvegicus is omnivorous and the others are basically herbivorous. However, they show unusual food habits and, for example, R. rattus eats bark and an excessive amount of insects when starving. Renal functions and food habits prove that R. norvegicus is the most prone to thirst, whereas M. musculus thrives in dry habitats. Feeding behavior is peculiar to rodent spicies and has caracteristic relationship with harming mechanisms. Therefore, feeding behavior of involved species is a key factor to solve harming mechanisms.

N2  - The total Hb content and the electrophoretically distinguishable components were compared among 10 species of Chironomus. The respiration rates and the survival rates under anoxia were also evaluated for all species. Although larvae used for experiments were all reared under the same laboratory condition, the Hb content and composition differed interspecifically, suggesting genetic control of Hb production in Chironomus. However, the phylogenetic relationship inferred from a cluster analysis of Hb components differed greatly from the phylogeny based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. The phylogenetic congruence suggests that some convergent evolution occurs in Hb composition of some lentic Chironomus species. Among the three factors, respiration rate, total Hb content and Hb diversity, the survival duration under anoxia was significantly correlated with the Hb content and respiration rate. In the species inhabiting a lentic environment where the chironomids are frequently exposed to low oxygen conditions, high respiration rates and high survival rates may be achieved by possession of abundant and specific Hbs compared with the lotic species' Hb.

Metofluthrin was the most effective against the four colonies of Cx. quinquefasciatus. The LD50-based relative effective ratio of metofluthrin against d-allethrin was higher in Cx. quinquefasciatus (33.3 to 78.8) than in Cx. pipiens pallens (27.8). The Vietnam colony was the most susceptible among the colonies in the study.

N2  - The efficacy of etoxazole, an insect growth regulator, against Haemaphysalis longicornis was examined by several laboratory tests and field trials. It showed 100% inhibition of egg-hatching at a dose of 1.0μg administration onto engorged female ticks. Against engorged larvae, 100% molting inhibition was observed when the agent was applied at a dose of 0.1μg/cm^2 on a glass dish for 0.5 hr as well as in engorged nymphal tick dosing 0.1μg/cm^2 for 3.5 hr or 1.0μg/cm^2 for 0.5 hr. In the field examination, a solution containing 1.0% of etoxazole was applied onto the back of cattle by the pour-on method. After administration, engorged ticks on the cattle were collected longitudinally and then examined for molting of larvae and nymphs and for hatching of eggs laid by sensitized female ticks. At one-day after administration, inhibition rate was 100% against both molting and hatching. The inhibition effect of the agent gradually decreased but seemed to be maintained for three weeks. The results showed etoxazole inhibited the development of ticks in all of their life-stages and, therefore, it would be a promising agent as an applicable acaricide in the fields.

N2  - Morphological characters of Simulium konoi (Takahasi) so far assigned to the subgenus Simulium (Nevermannia) are revised based on female, male, pupal and larval specimens collected from Tottori (type locality), Oita and Ibaraki, Japan. There was no difference in most morphological characters among the different populations. Simulium konoi is transferred to a Holarctic subgenus Simulium (Boreosimulium), because it has a combination of the subgeneric key characters including arms of furcasternum without any projection directing ventrally, slender male style tapered to pointed apex, paramere with several hooks, and the larval antenna with 3-5 colorless annular bands. This species is easily distinguished from all the 16 known species of the subgenus Boreosimulium by the female cibarium with several oblique rows of denticles, an autoapomorphic character not found so far in other species of Simuliidae.

N2  - The possible introduction of potential mosquito vectors of disease from one country to another is a matter of considerable public health concern. Such introductions have occurred both by aircrafts and by ships. A survey was therefore carried out on vessels arriving from abroad at Qinhuangdao Port, P. R. China, to determine whether mosquitoes were aboard the incoming ships. Many of the arriving ships were found positive for mosquitoes with an average rate of positive ships being 56. 81% (417/734). Thirteen species of mosquitoes were identified, but three species, namely: Culex modestus Ficalbi, 1889, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus Giles, 1901 and Aedes dorsalis (Meigen, 1830) were the dominant mosquito species found. The findings show that introduced mosquitoes may represent a serious problem.

N2  - A new black-fly species, Simulium (Nevermannia) uemotoi sp. nov., is described based on female, male, pupal and mature larval specimens collected from Oita, Japan. This new species is assigned to the vernum species-group and is distin-guished from other known related species by a combination of the following characters: katepisternum with several hairs on each side and 1st and 2nd segments of maxillary palp ocherous in both sexes of adults; frons with two long and one short trichomes on each side, gill with four slender thread-like filaments and simple wall-pocket-shaped cocoon in the pupa; and small, M-shaped or rounded postgenal cleft and simple rectal organ in the larva. A new name S. (TV.) onoi is given for the species which was collected from Hokkaido and erroneously identified as Cnetha konoi by Ono.

N2  - Small amounts of hydramethylnon were dispersed in a test arena or inside of harborages by the German cockroaches, Blattella germanica, following their feeding on gel bait with this active ingredient. Water, cockroach carcasses and their feces were also contaminated with hydramethylnon. When fresh colonies of the German cockroaches were exposed to the contaminated arena or harborages, most died within 20 days; mortality from exposure to water, carcasses, and feces was less than in the contaminated arena or harborages. The amount of feces produced by cockroaches feeding on hydramethylnon was less than what cockroaches normally produce. Bait dyed with red color (Pamo acid pyribinium) provided evidence of cockroaches carrying small amounts of bait to the inside of harborages and the floor of the test arena. Delayed action of hydramethylnon bait against the German cockroaches might be the result of exposure to contaminated harborages or the surface of the foraging area.

N2  - Inhibitory effects of a neem formulation on emergence of two common species of mosquitoes were evaluated. When fourth-instar larvae of Ochlero-tatus japonicus and Culex pipiens pallens were exposed to 1.9 ppm and 0.6 ppm solution of azadirachtin, 99% and 75% inhibition of the adult emergence was observed, respectively. The 1.9 ppm solution showed mainly larvicidal effects on these mosquitoes, but the 0.6 ppm solution mainly inhibited the emergence.

N2  - Larval and pupal developments of the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, reared on two different kinds of artificial diets were compared. One diet known to be suitable for larval-pupal and pupal-adult developments shows a normal development in the larval and pupal stages but the other inhibited the development of all stages except for the larval-larval development. From the analysis in the fatty acid profiles of these diets, we found the former diet to be rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the latter to be rich in α-linolenic acid but to be lacking EPA. After addition of EPA to the latter diet, the larvae in which pupal development had been arrested were able to develop to pupae and then adults. Each fatty acid profile of larvae, pupae and adults reared on the individual diets was examined. The main fatty acid compositions of mosquitoes reared on the former diet were palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, arachidonic and EPA. EPA content in adults (13.7%) was higher than in larvae (7.9%) and pupae (8.6%), and 3.7% in triacylglycerols and 21.1% in phospholipids. Larvae reared on the latter diet showed fatty acid contents of palmitic (30.0%), palmitoleic (22.5%), oleic (17.4%), linoleic (15.9%) and a-linolenic acids (6.1%). From these results we conclude that EPA is an essential fatty acid for larval-pupal and pupal-adult development and that the EPA synthetic pathway does not start from a-linolenic acid in An. stephensi larvae.

N2  - Insecticide resistance and possible underlying mechanisms were studied in 52 strains of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.) field-collected from Peninsular Malaysia. These strains were assayed using a lethal time assay at 1Ox susceptible LC_<95> concentrations of propoxur (1.10μg/cm^2), chlorpyrifos (18.40μg/ cm^2), permethrin (1.70μg/cm^2) and deltamethrin (0.55μg/cm^2) using a surface-contact exposure method with reference to the susceptible ICI strain. Results indicated that propoxur and permethrin resistance were highly prevalent (73.0% and 80.2% of LT_<50> RR > 10x, respectively) while low prevalence of deltamethrin (29.6%) and chlorpyrifos (4.0%) resistance (RR >5) were detected. Resistance level was partially suppressed in most of the strains when piperonyl butoxide (lOOμg/insect) and S,S,S,-tributylphos-phorotrithioates (30μg/insect) were used, indicating possible involvement of elevated monooxygenase and esterase. In addition, altered acetylcholinesterase was also suspected in eight strains. The percentage mortality of field populations were found to be distributed at two extremes when treated topically with deltamethrin at LC_<99> (0.056 μg/insect), indicating higher numbers of homogenous susceptible and resistant strains, respectively in those populations tested. Results obtained using topical application (percentage mortality) and surface-contact exposure method (resistance ratio) were not well correlated (r^2 = 0.169, P= 0.023).

N2  - Enterobacteriaceae and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 were detected in the body of the larvae and pupae of housefly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus), reared on an artificial diet containing EHEC. However, the detection rates of Enterobacteriaceae and EHEC O157:H7 in the body of housefly at each developmental stage tended to be reduced during metamorphosis. Enterobacteriaceae was detected in 32.6% of the newly-emerged adult houseflies, while no EHEC O157:H7 was detected in them. Moreover, the adult houseflies carried EHEC O157:H7 from sources to foods, and the majority of the foods were contaminated with EHEC O157:H7 for 24 h exposure in the transmission experiment. These results suggested that EHEC O157:H7 would be exclusively transmitted by adhesion to their external surface, feeding, flight and excretion of the adult houseflies. Judging from epidemiological characterization: polymerase chain reaction analysis (stxl, stx2, eaeA and hlyA genes), plasmid profiling (90-kbp plasmid), reversed-passive latex agglutination analysis (verotoxin-producing ability) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, EHEC O157:H7 strains from houseflies and those from patients were very similar. Therefore, EHECs found in houseflies possibly cause diseases against humans. Collectively, the houseflies as a trespasser on the distribution routes of human food may play an important role as a vector for pathogens such as EHEC O157:H7.

N2  - "Mosquito allergy" is a unique disease characterized by intense local skin symptoms and high fever following mosquito bites, which was reported in Japan in 1969 for the first time. At first, the unique symptoms of this disease were at-tractive to many physicians and immunologists. Thereafter, since many cases had been accumulated, the fact that most of the patients with "mosquito allergy" had died of hematological malignancies, such as malignant histiocytosis, malignant lymphoma and leukemia, with the years appeared in 1980s. We were interested in this disease from the virological and hematological point of view. Through the collaborative studies of 5 cases, we proved that "mosquito allergy" was the primary manifestation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated natural killer (NK) cell leukemia /lymphoma in the end of 1990s. As "mosquito allergy" is not an allergic disease, it have been called hypersensitivity to mosquito bites (HMB). Then we proposed HMB-EBV-NK (HEN) disease as one of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases in order to find the patients who would suffer from hematological malignancies in the early stage of their disease.

Ixodid ticks were collected at 14 sites, Futagawa (two sites), Uto, Arahira, Kamitakakuma (two sites), Onohara, Yadorihara (four sites) and Kamikawa (three sites), on the Osumi Peninsula, Kagoshima Prefecture in May and June 2001, and also collected additionally at Onohara and Kamikawa in May 2002. A total of 767 ixodid ticks was collected. They were identified as three genera and eight species as follows: Haemaphysalis flava, H. formosensis, H. longicornis, H. hystricis, Ixodes ovatus, I. nipponensis, I. turdus, and Amblyomma testudinarium. H. flava and H. longicornis seemed to be the dominant species in the survey areas. With a primer pair Rl, R2, which amplifies the genomic DNA from the spotted fever group rickettsiae, an approximately 540 bp fragment was amplified from 15 samples of six sites; H. flava (seven samples), H. longicornis (three samples), H. hystricis (four samples) and A. testudinarium (one sample). With a primer pair Rj5, RjlO, which amplifies the genomic DNA only from R. japonica, a 357 bp fragment was amplified from four samples of three sites; H. flava (three samples) and H. hystricis (one sample). H. flava seems to be the most important vector tick for Japanese spotted fever in Kagoshima Prefecture. Seasonal occurrence of the ixodid population was surveyed at three sites, Takatoge, Onohara and Komagahara from May 2002 to April 2003. H. flava nymphs were collected throughout the year, and a large number of nymphs was collected in spring. Adults showed a similar fluctuation pattern to the nymphal pattern. A large number of adults was collected from February to April but not in August and September.

N2  - In order to establish measures to control houseflies (Musca domestica L.) which break out from organic fertilizers applied in horticulture, a series of basic studies on their physiology and/or ecology was carried out. From these studies, it was found that their reactions to chemicals were different depending on the developmental stage. One finding was that, while eggs were deposited preferably, the growths of the larvae were inhibited in each media containing sucrose. Furthermore, sucrose caused repellent reaction to the larvae at early to middle stage and exhibited a tendency of lethal action to the larvae at the middle to prepupal stage. Based on these results, the effects of sucrose on the larvae of houseflies were further investigated. The results indicated that the larvae at the middle stage which were contact-treated with 2 M sucrose for 2 hours suffered 96.0±5.2% mortality before pupation. While 93.8% of the tested population died between 24 and 60 hours after treatment, the timing was almost coincident with that of normal pupation for the untreated population. On the other hand, when the applied sucrose was washed off from the body surface immediately after the contact treatment, the larvae grew normally as untreated larvae did. The observed growth-inhibitory effects of sucrose were considered to be due to its contact with the body surface of the larvae. It was also considered that sucrose might influence the physiological activities of pupation induced by internal materials such as molting hormone at their prepupal stage.

N2  - Precise description of life cycles based on the checking of ovaries of wild-caught flies revealed that Thricops diaphanus spends a uni-voltine life cycle at highlands in central Japan, though this species has been known to spend multi-voltine life cycles in Europe. In the collections of the flies at different altitude, seasonal migrations between highlands and lowlands of T. diaphanus were not observed. These facts suggest that T. diaphanus is a glacial relict species. Seasonal modification of the vertical microdistribution pattern of this species in subalpine coniferous forests seems to be related with the distribution of fungi in such forests.

N2  - A semi-practical test was conducted in order to evaluate the suppression effect of a total release aerosol (TRA) containing a newly developed acaricide, amidoflumet, on the house dust mite, Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes. Three pieces of carpet sized 80 × 80 cm with harbored mites were maintained by distinct procedures: (1) TRA treatment with weekly vacuuming (Chemical treatment), (2) weekly vacuuming only without TRA (Control A) and (3) 5 vacuumings a week without TRA (Control B). The number of live mites and the mite allergen levels (Der f I and Der f II) obtained from 25 cm^2 area of the carpets were compared with up to 57 days posttreatment. The number of live mites in the chemical treatment carpet was reduced to 1% of the pretreatment level at day 8 and was maintained at the low level (< 5 living mites/25 cm^2) until day 43. The quantities of Der f I and Der f II in the chemical treatment carpet decreased to 45% and 55% of the pretreatment level, respectively. For the control A carpet, the number of live mites and the allergen levels kept increasing for 57 days, and the number of live mites, Der f I and Der f II at day 57 reached 36, 14 and 25 times more than the day 0 levels, respectively. In the contol B carpet, the numbers of live mite between day8 and day 22 were greater than that of day 0. The mite allergen levels of the control B fluctuated until day 22 and then decreased to 6% (Der f I) or 4% (Der f II)of the day 0 levels. This was due to less absolute weight of the collected dust in the control B. Consequently, a treatment of the amidoflumet TRA combined with weekly vacuum cleaning was considered to be a more effective strategy than frequent cleaning (5 times/week) alone for the house dust mite and mite allergen. It was also suggested that more frequent cleanings with a TRA treatment would enhance the allergen avoidance effect.

N2  - This paper reports the occurrence of Toxorhynchites splendens (Wiede-mann, 1819) larvae in some drains of Kolkata (Calcutta), India from 2000 to 2001, and the efficacy of its predation on larval Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), Anopheles stephensi Liston, 1901, Armigeres subalbatus Coqullett, 1898 and Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1823 in the laboratory. Tx. splendens larvae were found in all twelve months in two shaded drains with clear and still water, black sediments and accumulated leaves. In the laboratory experiments, Tx. spierndens fed on all of the 4 prey species larvae, and the predation rate depends on the stage of both predators and prey. The 1st and 3rd instars of Tx. splendens showed lowest and highest predation rate, respectively. Predation rate by any stage of Tx. splendens was highest in 1st instar larvae and lowest in 4th instar larvae of all prey species. The variations in consumption rate seemed to be related with the size of the prey larvae offered rather than to the preference for any species. This suggests that Tx. splendens could effectively be used in the biological control programme of mosquitoes in Kolkata, and field trials should be conducted using this species.

N2  - Flying mosquitoes were collected at a pair of collection sites at different heights from the ground by a suction trap enhanced with 1 kg of dry ice in summer in 2001 and 2002, on the campus of Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, and on a small desert island in Nagasaki, Japan. One collection site was near a tree canopy (6-12 m above the ground) and the other one at about 1 m above the ground. At each collection site, the trap was operated for 24 h to collect both noctunal and diurnal species. The following 9 species were encountered ; albopictus (Skuse), Ochlerotaus nipponicus LaCasse et Yamaguti, Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett, Armigeres subalbatus (Coquillett), Cx. tritaeniorhynchus Giles, Cx. halifaxi Theobald,CX. bitaeniorhynchus Giles, Orthopodomyia anopheloides (Giles), Tripteroides bamubusa (Yamada). The proportion of mosquitoes collected near the tree canopy was calculated for 4 dominant species ; 3.9 (females) and 1.2% (males) for Ae.albopictus, 64.5% for females of Cx. pipens pallens, 19% for females of Ar. subalbatus and 26.7% for females of CX. tritaeniorhynchus. The vertical distribution of flying moscmitoes in relation to the location of their vertebrate host is discussed.

N2  - I evaluated the acceptability of three anticoagulant rodenticides (warfarin, bromadiolone and flocoumafen) by the roof rat, Rattus rarrus, using Acceptability-index calculated by the following formula : A-index={(X-Y)/(X+Y)}×100. X=average intake (g/day/kg) of poison bait, and Y=average intake of blank bait. The average A-index in bromadiolone (50 ppm) mixed with sunflower seeds and sesame oil was 0.5 in comparison with the blank bait and the resultant mortality was 100%. This value of the index was the highest of all three rodenticides. The index in flocoumafen (50 ppm) was -42.2, which was small but the mortality was as high as 70%. The indexes in warfarin (250 ppm) mixed with seeds and oil, and warfarin (50 ppm) were -52.9 and -37.1, respectively. Both of these values in warfarin were small and the mortalities were O%. The index in warfarin (250 ppm) without seeds and oil was -65.2, which was the smallest of all test samples, though the mortality was 20%. Therefore, bromadiolone and flocoumafen are promising agents for the control of roof rats in Japan.

N2  - Human body louse is a significant vedor of infectious diseases including typhus, relapsing fever and trench fever. In order to perform an infection assay of these pathogens efficiently using human louse, and to maintain colonies of louse in the laboratory without human volunteers, we attempted to establish an artificial blood feeding system. Using parafilm^[○!R] membranes and blood-absorbed cotton, we made a blood pad and body lice were fed on the pad fixed on a petri-dish. As a result, body lice efficiently engorged blood through the membrane and more than 30 percent of the hatched larvae reached the adult stage. This system was suitable for performing an artificial infection assay although it was still insufficient for maintaining a colony for many generations.

N2  - The longevity of the smoky-brown cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa (Serville) which fed on their own feces or dried carcasses was remarkably short compared to those fed on mouse foods under the laboratory condition. The cockroaches were reluctant to feed on their feces or dried carcasses. When two kinds of food materials were placed separately in a plastic arena, the cockroaches preferred mouse foods to feces or carcasses, and no remarkable difference was found in consumptions between feces and carcasses. When dried feces, dried carcasses (both of the cockroaches), and mouse food in each of three small aluminum cups were placed side by side in the plastic arena, the cockroaches ate the mouse food most, followed by dried carcasses, and they did not eat their own feces. Comparing food preference among four kinds of insect's feces : the smoky-brown cockroach, the silkworm, Bombyx mori Linne the common cutworm, Spodoptera litira Fabricius and the drug store beetle, Stegobium Paniceum Fabricius the cockroaches selected silkworm feces most, then the drug store beetle's feces ; they did not consume their own feces or the feces of the common cutworm. In the case of ideal food absence, the cockroaches showed cannibalism. The results demonstrate that feces or dried carcasses of the cockroaches may not be suitable food for the smoky-brown cockroaches.

N2  - An investigation on the recolonization and population dynamics of the Redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) was conducted bimonthly at a seaside park in Kaizuka City, Osaka, Japan, after all the spiders were completely removed from the study area in December 2000. The Redback spiders invaded again in February 2001, and their population density was recovered in December 2001. This study confirmed that breeding of Redback spiders began in June and continued until December.The minimum population observed in June was composed of only adult female individuals, while the maximum population found in December 2001 mainly consisted of larvae. The prolonged breeding might have caused the increase of population density and dispersal. The temperature measured ranged from -0.5℃ to 46.1℃ ; however. the Redback spider tolerated this harsh environment. This confirmed that the Redback spider, a tropical or subtropical species, is capable of colonizing even in the temperate area in Japan.

N2  - Survival and development of larvae of Anopheles dirus Peyton et Harrison, An. minimus Theobald and An. stephensi Liston were examined under natural temperature in a temperate area, Nagasaki (32゜45' N, 129°52' E), Japan. Experiments with hatched larvae were conducted 7 times at 1-month intervals from April to October 2002. The larvae could develop to adults and a seasonal change was observed in the developmental period of all three species. The relationships between the average air temperature and the developmental rate observed from April to October 2002 were analyzed by a linear regression method to estimate the threshold air temperature of larval development. The estimated threshold air temperatures of larval development for females of An. dirus, An. minimimus and An. stephensi were 9.4℃, 5.7℃ and 9.3℃, respectively. A seasonal change was also observed in the body sizes of pupae.

N2  - Laboratory and field performance of a bait toxicant, lithium perfluorooctane sulfonate (Sulfotine^<TM>) [LPOS] in bait station (1% LPOS) in comparison with a commercially available bait station (containing 0.5% chlorpyrifos) were tested against the American cockroach,Periplaneta americana (Linnaeus) and other peridomestic cockroach species in lowincome houses and apartments in Penang Island, Malaysia. Laboratory evaluation indicated that there was minimal difference between the performance of LPOS baits and that of the chlorpyrifos bait, when tested against P. americana, P. brunnea and P. australasiae. In field studies, LPOS- and chlorpyrifosbased bait stations reduced trapped domiciliary and peridomestic cockroaches by 95% and >85% within the first two weeks following treatment, respectively. At the 12th week post-treatment, LPOS still provided >99% reduction in cockroach trap counts. Further studies were executed to evaluate the effects of bait numbers on the performance of LPOS baits against the American cockroach in suburban apartments (35.8 m^2). It was demonstrated that 4-8 baits were needed to achieve good control of the cockroach population (i. e. about 90% reduction within 1 week post-treatment). Sanitation levels were positively correlated with percentage reduction in trap counts in houses treated with lower bait numbers ; however, when higher number of baits were used, the role of sanitation on reduction of cockroach numbers was lessened.

N2  - his is the first report on chironomid communities captured by light traps at the Fuji Five Lakes in the fall season. A comparison of the chironomid communities was made among these lakes in relation to the eutrophic level. We identified a total of 33 species belonging to three subfamilies, i. e., 16 species of Orthocladiinae, 16 species of Chironominae and 1 species of Tanypodinae. We recorded a total of 24 newly recorded species around these lakes. In Lake Yamanaka, Tanytarsus takahasii, Stictochironomus sticticus and Tanytarsus yunosecundus were the dominant species, whereas ProPsilocerus akamusi was dominant in Lake Kawaguchi and Smittia insignis in Lake Motosu. 0nly Smittia aterrima was a common spedes in the Fuji Five Lakes. Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') was highest at 2.63 in Lake Shoji and lowest at 0.99 in Lake Kawaguchi. 0ur results suggest remarkable differences in chironomid communities between rather oligotrophic lakes such as Lakes Motosu and Sai, and the more eutrophicated ones such as Lakes Shoji and Kawaguchi. Although Lake Yamanaka was classified as a mesotrophic lake in previous studies, this lake seems to be undergoing profirressive eutrophication.

N2  - The host-seeking (the vertical activity in plastic cylinders) and feeding activities (the rate of engorgement) of a new generation of Amblyomma testudinarium nymphs that were placed outdoors from the engorged larval stage were observed under experimental conditions from July to October 2002. The vertical activity of the nymphs (molted outdoors in late June 2002) in plastic cylinders placed outdoors was low from July to early September, but abruptly increased from mid- September. The rate of engorgement of the nymphs observed using rabbits under laboratory conditions (25℃, 16L-8D photoperiod) was low in July and August ; however, it significantly increased in September and October. These results suggest that the host-seeking and feeding activities of the new generation of A. testudinarium nymphs are suppressed in the summer. Since the host-feeding activity of the nymphs was observed in a laboratory maintained at 25℃, the suppression did not appear to be a simple quiescence caused by temperature. However, it is not clear whether the suppression is due to diapause.

N2  - A total of 11 genera and 13 species belonging to 9 families of the dipterous insects were reared from feces of the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo hanedae Kuroda) in Chita, Aichi Prefecture, Central Japan. Of the 13 species of flies reared, 3 were markedly predominant, Parasarcophaga similis (Sarcophagidae), Siphunculina nidicola and S. simulata (Chloropidae). Among these species, P. similis was the most dominant fly, which constituted 34.4% of the total, and reached the highest population in early December. S. nidicola (26.1% of the total) and S. simulata (22.8%) have also produced large numbers. The massive emergence peak of the former showed in early September, and the latter in early October. These 3 specific cumulative percentages amounted to about 83% of the total individuals. The emergence season of P. similis was from June to December, the longest period of all the reared species. Only one species, Anthomyia illocata (Anthomyiidae) was commonly found among the known 5 species which were reared from cormorant feces in Japan. Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae) and Allotrichoma nigriantennalis (Ephydridae) were investigated and found to emerge from small animal excreta for the first time.

N2  - Biological studies on larval development, insemination and oviposi- tion of Anopheles minimus from Ishigaki Island, the Ryukyu Archipelago, were conducted under laboratory conditions. The larval developmental period was shortened and high pupation and emergence rates were obtained when larvae were reared under the conditions of the non-aeration method, standard food volume and 200-300 larvae per container. Insemination rate was increased with adult density per cage as well as cage size. The number of eggs per fed female was dependent on the method for oviposition. The study showed the following conditions to be suitable for rearing and obtaining a large number of An. minimus originated from Ishigaki Island, the Ryu- kyus: (1) the drip method for larval rearing should be used in the early generation to estimate suitable food volume and after that, by non-aeration; (2) 200-300 larvae per pan with food volume of 25 mg for the 1st, 50 mg for the 2nd, 100 mg for the 3rd and 150 mg for the 4th-instar larvae; (3) adult cage larger than at least the medium-sized cage; and (4) individual oviposition method in small vials.

N2  - In order to know the distribution and seasonal appearance of Anopheles minimus Theobald in the Yaeyama Island group, except Ishigaki Island, a comprehensive larval survey was carried out in Iriomote, Kohama, Hateruma and Yonaguni Islands from 1999 to 2000. Immatures of An. minimus were found in 4 out of 20 habitats examined in Iriomote Island, and 6 out of 13 habitats including streams, springs and ground pools near the springs examined, in Kohama Island. The abundance of the immatures in Hora Stream of Iriomote Island, and a spring of Kohama Island, showed seasonal variation which was positively correlated with water temperature. The immature was not collected during winter season (December to February) in Hora Stream. The density was high in August and October 1999 and June 2000, being 169, 151 and 111 larvae/100 dips, respectively. In the spring of Kohama, the density was 268 in August 1999, and 516 in June 2000. This is the first record of An. minimus for Kohama Island. The immature was not found in Hateruma and Yonaguni Islands.

N2  - Delayed oogenesis in a Japanese blow fly, Aldrichina grahami (Aidrich), was induced both under long-day and short-day photoperiods at moderate temperatures (20-23℃), but was terminated within 11 days after protein ingestion without changing the photoperiod or temperature. Long days (LD 14:10-16:8) produced delayed ovarian development in more than 95% females whereas a short day (LD 10 : 14) did it in about 50%. About 30% of females newly eclosed under long days retained undeveloped ovaries with previtellogenic follicles more than two weeks. This may be considered to be responsible for completing long-term aestivation in the montane zone. The characteristics of delayed oogenesis in the blow fly are discussed in terms of oligopause and diapause.

N2  - Collections of triatomine bugs inhabiting inside dwellings at villages of two prefectures in Guatemala were carried out and 293 individuals of Rhodnius prolixus and 170 individuals of Toriatoma dimidiata were obtained, both of which are the main vector species of Chagas' disease in Guatemala. Of these, 202 (68.9%) of R. prolixus and 157 (92.4%) of T. dimidiata were engorged. Blood meal analysis with ELISA revealed that the sources of 97 blood meals (48.0%) of R. prolixus which were identified to be human (28.2%), followed by chicken (7.9%) and opossum (7.4%). Eighty two blood meals (52.2%) of T. dimidiata and they were to be human (30.6%) followed by opossum (15.3%) and cow (7.0%). Multiple feedings were observed 12 blood meals (12.4%) of R. prolixus and 16 (19.5%) of T. dimidiata. It turns out that triatomine bugs inhabiting inside of the dwellings in Guatemala prefer human most as the blood source.

N2  - The activities ofAmblyomma testudinarium nymphs collected from the field in May, August, and October 2001 were observed in plastic cylinders placed outdoors. The activity of the field-collected nymphs in May was found from June to September, but disappeared from October to August 2002. The activity of the field-collected nymphs in August was found from September to November and in the spring (March to June) of 2002. However, the number of the active nymphs was small in the spring of 2002. The field-collected nymphs in October showed high activity in the spring (March to June) of 2002. Since the nymphs which molted in 2000 (old generation) did not survive until the spring of 2002, the field-collected nymphs in August and October 2001 appeared to include the new generation (molted in 2001). Thus, the participation of the new generation of A. testudinarium nymphs appears to occur from summer, although the number is small.

N2  - The effects of photoperiod on the termination of behavioral diapause of Ixodes persulcatus Schulze adults reared in a laboratory (24°C, 16L-8D photoperiod) from egg to adult ecdysis was examined in plastic cylinders which were placed outdoors. The activity of the adults which were kept in the laboratory until March 2002 after they had molted (August 2001) and then transferred into a plastic cylinder was rarely found in the spring. However, the adults which were kept in the laboratory (16L-8D photoperiod) until August 2001 after molting (June 2001) and then exposed to a 12L-12D photoperiod (24°C) until March 2002 showed high activity in the spring. These results suggest that the exposure to a medium-day photoperiod is important for the termination of behavioral diapause of I. persulcatus adults.

N2  - This is a review of Japanese studies on the vector mosquitoes of dengue fever. The article consists of four parts. The first describes the process of vector incrimination with a focus on Aedes albopictus. The next, vector studies during the epidemic occurred in Japan, 1942-43. The third part summarizes recent advances in biological and epidemiological studies on Aedes albopictus, particularly after the second world war. Finally, I discuss the cause of the sharp increase in dengue fever during 1942 and 1943. A list of papers on dengue vector mosquitoes in Japan is presented.

The late fourth instar larvae were exposed to different concentrations of pyriproxyfen for 24 hours, then the number of dead or emerging pupae collected within 2 days after exposure were counted by sex. A higher susceptibility of males than females to pyriproxyfen was observed for all colonies. The comparison of IC_<50> among the three Ae. aegypti colonies showed that susceptibility of the Ae. aegypti RR colony, which is resistant to DDT and permethrin, was lower than that of other colonies.

N2  - The algogenic effects of venom gland extract (VGE) from the red back widow spiders (Latrodectus hasseltii) and its component α-latrotoxin were investigated in mice. Mice were given an intraplantar injection of VGE or α-latrotoxin into the hind paw, and licking of the injected site was assessed as a pain-associated response. The VGE increased dose dependently the licking behavior at doses of 1/300th to 1/30th venom gland. The licking behavior elicited by an injection of VGE at a dose of 1/100th venom gland was significantly suppressed by subcutaneous pretreatment with the opioid analgesic morphine hydrochloride (3 and 10 mg/kg) but not the aspirin-like drugs, such as ketoprofen (10 and 30 mg/kg) and diclofenac sodium (10 and 30 mg/kg). An intraplantar injection of heat-treated VGE did not elicit licking behavior. An injection of α-latrotoxin (30 and 300 ng) markedly increased licking behavior. These findings suggest that an injection of VGE causes severe pain through non-inflammatory mechanisms. It is possible that the algogenic action of VGE is at least partly mediated by α-latrotoxin.

N2  - In the course of epidemiological studies on mosquito-borne diseases in Lao PDR in 2000, an undescribed species of genus Armigeres was collected from bamboo internodes with a bamboo hole in Khammouane Province. This species has special morphological characteristics in the male genitalia with an expanded gonostylus having 20 strong teeth, of which the anterior half was longer than the rest. Careful comparisons with related species show that the newly collected material belongs to a new species. It is named as Armigeres (Armigeres) laoensis sp. nov. after the country Lao PDR.

N2  - Hayesomyia tripunctata (Goetghebuer, 1922) (Chironomidae, Tanypodinae) is recorded for the first time in Japan. The adult male of Hayesomyia is similar to that of Rheopelopia, while the former differs from the latter in retention of small ScuL (scutal lamella), but this difference is often unclear. It seems the most distinctive characteristic of the former is the structure of gonostylus which narrows abruptly before the apex. Rheopelopia seiryuuvea (Sasa, Suzuki et Sakai, 1998) is sunk as a synonym of H. tripunctata, based on type-examination.

N2  - Since the redback spider, Latrodectus hasseltii Thorell, was first confirmed in November 1995 in the Osaka Bay area in Japan and became established in high density in areas adjacent to the Kansai International Airport, its distribution range continues to expand. Based on the outcome of the redback spider surveys, we implemented address matching and tabulated the survey year, the address of confirmed infested sites and number of webs by year using GIS computer software and digital maps. We furthermore mapped the expanded areas of the spider infestation by year and address and produced density distribution maps for each year from 1995 to 2001 and a map for the period of the surveillance. In addition, since biting cases have been reported, we examined the relationship between the spider density and the number of biting cases. From our GIS analysis it became clear that the distribution range of the redback spider clearly continues to expand in Osaka Prefecture and the expansion of the spider occurred gradually in some coastal areas and dispersed from the densely distributed areas to the more inner areas in Osaka Prefecture. These analyses also show that the number of biting cases by the redback spider will increase in Osaka and surrounding prefectures infested with redback spiders.

N2  - Effects of the predator Mesocylops pehperiensis (Hu) (Copepoda: Cyclopoida) on the survivorship and the development of a cohort of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) to pupation were examined in large (diameter = 8.5 cm and depth = 5.5 cm) and small (diameter = 3.5 cm and depth = 5.5 cm) containers with leaves from the maple Acer buergerianum (Miq.) (Angiospermae: Aceraceae) as larval food. In the absence of the predator, survival was higher and developmental time shorter in the large container. M. pehpeiensis reduced the survivorship of Ae. albopictus from 93% to 12% in the large container and from 34% to 0% in the small container. Ae. albopictus larvae developed to larger size in shorter time in the large container with the predator than in those without the predator. These results indicate that the predator has both direct (reducing the number of mosquitoes) and indirect (enhancement of the fitness of survived individuals fitness) effects on mosquito populations, which may cause difficulty in mosquito control under some conditions. So, vector control operations including the use of copepods can be counterproductive with regard to potentially crucial interactions between the absence of competition, body size and its epidemiological importance in container-breeding mosquito such Ae. albopictus.

N2  - The feeding activity of Amblyomma testudinarium Koch nymphs that were placed outdoors from engorged larvae was observed under laboratory conditions (24℃, 10L-14D photoperiod) from October to December 2001. The rates of engorgement of the nymphs ranged from 48.3 to 55.0% in October to December. The rate of engorgement was not reduced even in December. These results suggest that A. testudinarium nymphs do not enter behavioral diapause on exposure to the short days of autumn. Since the vertical activity of the nymphs in the plastic cyliders becomes lower as the temperatures of autumn drop, their low activity in late autumn appears to be a simple quiescence due to the temperature.

N2  - In the laboratory condition, German cockroaches were reluctant to feed on their own feces or dried carcasses. When dried feces, dried carcasses of the cockroaches, and mouse food put in each of three small aluminum cups were placed side by side in a plastic arena the cockroaches usually selected the mouse food, followed by the dried carcasses but they did not eat the feces. The longevity of the cockroaches fed on feces or dried carcasses, was remarkably short compared with those fed on mouse food. Especially, when fed on feces or dried carcasses male cockroaches had a shorter lifespan than the females. In addition, no reproduction was observed in cockroaches fed on feces or dried carcasses. The results demonstrate that feces or dried carcasses of cockroaches may not be suitable food for the adult German cockroaches.

N2  - We observed the effects on the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche), on the cats and their environmental infestation by spraying the cats directly with flowable formulations containing synergized d-allethrin (synergist: N-(2-ethylhexyl)-bicycro[2,2,1]-hepta-5-en-2,3-dicarboximide; McLaughlin Gormley King Co., USA) and 0.16% or 0.4% pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone analogue. For comparision. three groups were evaluated; the first group of cats was treated with a synergized d-allethrin formulation only, the second group was treated with synergized d-allethrin and 0.16% or 0.4% pyriproxyfen formulation at a rate of 8 ml/kg of body weight, and the third group was treated with no insecticide formulation as control. The following results were obtained. The peak of adult cat flea infestation on the host, treated with the formulation containing pyriproxyfen, was at seven days after treating. Then, the population of fleas gradually decreased, and finally showed 100% reduction and such population was continued for 51 days. The hatching of eggs collected from cats treated with the formulation containing pyriproxyfen was completely inhibited for 70 days. The population of eggs, larvae and adults of cat fleas in the model room housing cats treated with the formulation containing pyriproxyfen, showed 100% reduction in 41, 19 and 23 days, respectively. The carpet in the room housing cats treated with the pyriproxyfen formulation indicated residual effectiveness of ovicidal. It can be concluded that flea infestations on cats may be controlled by pyriproxyfen in a test formulation applied directly onto cats. Therefore, pyriproxyfen can interrupt the flea life cycle and prevent new flea reinfestation.

N2  - In order to establish a simplified method of evaluating the insecticide susceptibility of the human louse, we examined the time-course knockdown of body lice (Pediculus humanus) to phenothrin, the only registered active pyrethroid ingredient of a pediculicide in Japan. Using an insecticide susceptible strain of the body louse (NIID strain), the knockdown effect of phenothrin was assessed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 and 24 h after the treatment by means of a continuous filter paper-contact method. The median knockdown concentration (KC_<50>) at 3 h was 31 mg/m^2 and that at 24 h was 33 mg/m^2, showing the rapid acute-toxicity of phenothrin. Thus it was suggested that 24 h observation is not necessarily needed to evaluate the insecticidal activity of phenothrin to the body lice.

N2  - Five chironomid species of the genus Chironomus were examined for caloric contents in adults and for their ability of calory removal from bodies of water by emergence and of water quality improvement in laboratory experiments. Calory per g adults was the highest (about 5,000 cal) for Chironomus kiiensis, higher than 2,500 cal for C. circumdatus, C. nippodorsalis and C. yoshimatsui and the lowest (about 2,000 call for C. nipponensis. The actual rate of removal by emergence was the highest (about 13%) for C. nippodorsalis, moderate (about 10%) for C. circumdatus and C. yoshimatsui, and the lowest (about 6%) for C. kiiensis and C. nipponensis. For inhibitory ability of eutrophication, in terms of PO_4-P concentration, about 89% of inhibition was observed for C. nipponensis. Inhibition was higher than 70% for C. circumadatus and C. yoshimatsui, about 31% for C. nippodorsalis, and the lowest (about 24%) for C. kiiensis at 4 weeks. For inhibitory ability in terms of protein concentration, inhibition was the highest (about 80%) for C. circumdatus, higher than 50% for C. kiiensis, C. nipponensis and C. yoshimatsui, and the lowest (about 41%) for C. nippodorsalis at 4 weeks.

N2  - This work presents the results of an experiment on the oviposition of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) where the oviposition sites were different sized-containers with or without leaf from the maple (Acer buergerianum) or from the camphorous (Cinnamomum japonicum). Oviposition responses varied according to container type, to leaf presence/absence as well as leaf type and amount. Oviposition was highest in the "large" container and in the presence of leaves, especially maple leaves, known as good larval nutritional substrate. In nature, container opening surface size is often correlated with the permanence of water as well as leaf litter input; thus, the most likely explanation of our results is that Ae. albopictus can discriminate habitats for oviposition that increase success for its offspring.

N2  - The progression of human cutaneous reactions, caused by the bite of non-infected unfed larval trombiculid mites, Leptotrombidium pallidum and/or L. scutellare was observed by applying unfed larvae to the flexure of the wrist of the forearm of two human volunteers. The histopathology of human skin in response to stylostome formation was also examined. Unfed larvae were also applied to laboratory mice. The infestation rate of L. scutellare (60.0-93.3%) was higher than that of L. pallidum (5.0-40.0%) on human skin. However, the infestation rates of L. pallidum and L. scutellare on mice were similar (63.5% and 57.0%, respectively) and showed no significant difference (P>0.05). The feeding period of L. pallidum (52.5-76.0 hrs) was longer than that of L. scutellare (42.3-51.4 hrs) in both human volunteers. However, the average feeding period of L.scutellare (45.1 hrs) on human skin was shorter than that on mice (60.2 hrs). The skin reactions to the L. scutellare and L. pallidum infestations differed in the two human volunteers. Volunteer A developed a slight skin reaction, whereas volunteer B exhibited a severe skin reaction. Specifically, a vesicle and bulla formations accompanied by pain and pruritus were observed at the bite site of volunteer B in every experimental infestation. The stylostomes formed by L. pallidum and L. scutellare were epidermal stylostomes, which did not extend beyond the basal layer of epidermis. All stylostomes exhibited considerable inflammation in the epidermis and similar reactivity.

N2  - Arrest of oogenesis in Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich) was induced by long days (16L : 8D) at 20℃ and the follicle remained undeveloped in the previtellogenic stage. Ovarian development takes place under short days (11L : 13D) at 20℃ and oviposition occurs 6 days after the adult emergence. Ecdysteroid content in the whole body was measured from adult emergence to day 6 after emergence and the maximum value of ecdysteroid (l,400pg) was detected in the non-diapausing female on day 4, when the uptake of yolk protein by the oocytes began. Lipid content of the ovary and the fat body were compared between females reared under short and long days. The main fatty acids were palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acid. Especially, the content of palmitoleic acid increased from 15 to 40%in the ovary and 23 to 41% in the fat body of the non-diapausing female within 6 days. The high content of palmitoleic acid which has a melting point of ±0.5℃, is assumed to enable A. grahami to undergo alternation of generations at the low environmental temperatures of the winter in Japan.

N2  - An ovi-trap survey was conducted to examine seasonal changes in dorsal scale pattern of Aedes aegypti in a densely populated area in Surabaya, Indonesia in 2000. Twenty ovi-traps were placed for 10 days indoors and outdoors in March, April, May, July, August and October 2000. Larvae and eggs appearing in the ovi-traps were carried to the laboratory and reared to adults. The dorsal pattern of adults was classified into 7 scale pattern classes based on the number of abdominal segments with scattered pale scales (CKM-method), and seasonal changes in the composition of the scale pattern classes were analyzed. The seasonal change in the composition of scale pattern class and the difference in the composition between indoor and outdoor mosquitoes was significant for both females and males. The proportion of the lightest form (the scale pattern class 7, Ae. aegypti var. queenslandensis) ranged from 12 to 47% in females and changed negatively with that of the darkest form (the scale pattern class 1). The composition of the scale pattern class 7 in the indoor sample was significantly higher than that of the outdoor sample in females. An artificial selection for increasing or decreasing white scaling on abdominal tergites was conducted in the laboratory, and one light- and one dark-Surabaya strain were successfully established within 10 generations of the selection.

N2  - In recent years the number of homeless people in metropolitan areas of Japan has been growing. In Tokyo alone, there are an estimated 5,600 homeless people. The Toshima City government has had outreach programs for the homeless people from 1984. In this program, medical staffs and sanitary inspectors have checked body lice infestation in patients since 1995. We analyzed the personal history and life style of the homeless people, and also checked lice infestation among the homeless people who came to outreach programs held in other municipalities in Tokyo. The average infestation rate of body lice found in outreach programs of Toshima City from 1999 to 2001 was 6.5%. The age of the most people infested with body lice was in their fifties, and many of them had histories of homelessness of less than a year. In outreach programs in Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Kita Cities, no body lice patients were found, but at a clinic of the Johoku Welfare Center in Taito City, about 100 body lice cases are found each year. This number is more than the total number of body lice patients in Japan reported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare because the reporting of body lice cases from welfare centers or public health offices is not obligatory. Lice-borne diseases are still epidemic in the world. It is important to consider problems related to poverty in the metropolitan areas in Japan, especially the need for fulfilling basic sanitary needs for homeless people. The monitoring of body lice cases and adequate support including lice control are strongly recommended.

N2  - The long-term population dynamics of chironomids were investigated in Lake Suwa, a shallow eutrophic lake in Central Japan, in order to clarify the temporal variations in the abundance of Propsilocerus akamusi (Tokunaga). The characteristics of the emergence of P. akamusi from the lake in recent years are (1) shorter emergence periods, (2) smaller number of midges collected, and (3) high ratio of females. These results clearly show that the number of D. akamusi in Lake Suwa has recently tended to decrease. There is significant relationship between the density of larvae in spring and the total number of midges trapped during the emergence period in fall. Thus, it is possible to estimate the focus of massive emergence of the midges from the larval density in the spring.

N2  - The subgenus Himalayum Lewis within the genus Simulium Latreille s.l. is a small group, including only two species, i.e., S. indicum Becher and S. nigrogilvum Summers, both of which are severe pests on humans at the southern foot of the Himalayas. In this study, the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene of S. nigrogilvum from Thailand was sequenced and compared with those of other species of related subgenera within the same genus. The molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that this species had a much closer relation with species of Simulium s. str. than with other subgenera such as Cnetha Enderlein, Gomphostilbia Enderlein, Nevermannia Enderlein and Wallacellum Takaoka in the Oriental Region, and was not separated from, but was nested in, species of Simulium s. str. Morphologically, the two Himalayum species are very similar to those of the subgenus Simulium, in particular, to those of the griseiforns species-group within it. It is suggested that the subgenus Himalayum should be treated as a junior synonym of Simulium s. str.

N2  - Collections of chironomid midges with a light trap were carried out in a rice paddy area in the suburbs of Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture, in order to elucidate the species and their seasonal prevalence. As the result, a total of 645 males of the chironomids were collected by seven successive collections. Eighteen genera and 36 species were identified. Differences were seen in the seasonal distribution among the species groups. The dominant species, Chironomus kiiensis Tokunaga, 1936, Tanytarsus oyamai Sasa, 1979 and Cricotopus sylvestris (Fabricius, 1794) were especially abundant in summer. In autumn and spring, Smittia aterrima (Meigen, 1818) was dominant.

N2  - Conditions of illumination and space required for mating and oviposition were listed for 28 species of chironomids based on laboratory experiments. Among these, eight species involving Cricotopus sylvestris and Propsilocerus akamusi were stenogamous, and fertillized egg masses were easily obtained in a small container (<9 cm in height) without any regular illumination cycles. Fertilized eggs of Chironomus javanus, C. kiiensis, C. okinawanus, Pentapedilum sordens, Polypedilum nubifer and Tanytarsus oyamai were obtained in a little larger container (<30 cm in height) without any illumination cycles. Those of Dicrotendipes enteromorphae and Kiefferulus glauciventris were obtained in the same container as C. javanus under a regular illumination cycle and shading by skylight narrowing. Those of C. circumdatus, C. yoshimatsui, D. lobiger, D. septemmaculatus, Nilodorum tainanus, Parachironomus arcuatus and Polypedilum nubeculosum were obtained in a small cage (134 cm in height) under the same luminous conditions as D. enteromorphae. Those of C. nippodorsalis, C. nipponensis and C. salinarius were obtained in a large cage (182 cm in height) under the same luminous conditions as D. enteromorphae. Those of C. flaviplumus and Polypedilum cultellatum were obtained in a small cage under a regular illumination cycle and shading by putting white acryl plates on the skylight.

N2  - There were no significant differences in trap catches of German Cockroaches starved for 24 hours between one sticky trap with baiting food on it and another without, when the two traps were placed side by side in an arena with or without rearing food near the traps. The traps with the bait caught 1.9 times as many males, and 1.7 times as many females, as did the trap with no bait, when cockroaches had been starved for 3 days and were used without rearing food in the arena, though the significance was still less than 90%. When the two traps were placed 15 cm apart from each other and rearing food was removed, the trap with the bait caught 2.75 times as many males and 4.5 times as many females, as did the non-bait trap, without pre-starvation of cockroaches, the differences between the baited trap and the non-bait trap being significant. The rates were 3 and 4.5 for males and females, respectively, when cockroaches had been starved for 3 days, and the differences between the baited trap and non-bait trap were highly significant. German cockroaches might be attracted by food bait, not to its pinpoint location but into a range of odorous space around it, and they might make oriented movement to the odorous range over a distance of at least 15 cm.

N2  - Thirty one field-collected strains of German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), collected between February 1997 and March 2000 from various locations in Peninsular Malaysia were screened for insecticide resistance using topical application method against three commonly used insecticides (propoxur, chlorpyrifos and deltamethrin). A discriminating dose (LD_99) obtained from bioassaying a laboratory susceptible strain, was used to determine the prevalence of insecticide-resistant individuals among the field populations tested. Results indicated that both propoxur and deltamethrin resistance patterns were relatively similar, i.e. more than 50% of the strains screened show low to moderate level of tolerance, while chlorpyrifos resistance is still relatively low among the tested populations. Resistant gene frequencies estimated ranged between 0.01 to 0.78, 0.05 to 0.51 and 0 to 0.86 for propoxur, chlorpyrifos and deltamethrin, respectively.

N2  - The ecology of the unfed larval trombiculid mite of Leptotrombidium pallidum infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi was studied in an endemic area, in northern Kyoto, Japan. Surveys were conducted in seven detailed study areas of a rice field heavily infested with 0. tsutsugamushi, once every spring and autumn during the years 1997 through 2001. A total of 5,295 unfed larvae from 4 genera and 7 species were collected from soil samples. The dominant species was L. intermedium (61.1%), followed by L. pallidum (34.5%). 0. tsutsugamushi was detected in only 2 species, L. pallidum andL. intermedium, and the infection rates were 15.6% (285/1,826) and 0.1% (3/3,237), respectively. The main vector species of 0. tsutsugamushi to humans and field rodents in the study area is considered to be L. pallidum. Serotypes of 0. tsutsugamushi in L. pallidum and L. intermedium were determined as Gilliam- and Karp-type rickettsiae, respectively. The locations of infective spots composed of infected unfed larval L. pallidum were patchily distributed in each detailed study area. One to 18 infected unfed larvae were identified in each infective spot. The numbers of infected mites in these spots reflect the infection risk of tsutsugamushi disease for humans exposed to infected unfed larvae in an infective spot. The location of infective spots was changeable, and the numbers of spots gradually decreased year by year. In each of the seven detailed study areas, infection rates of L. pallidum from the spring of 1997 to the spring of 1999 varied from 11.0% to 26.4%. However, both the infection rate and the number of infected larvae gradually decreased from the autumn of 1999, and no infected larvae were collected in the spring of 2001. These data could lead to a possible explanation of the process whereby an endemic area gradually disappears, and also an uncontaminated area could be converted to infective spots.

N2  - Fungi (eumycetes) isolated from the body surface of the cigarette beetles, Lasioderma serricorne Fabricius (Coleoptera: Anobiidae), were studied for their effect on food sanitation. The cigarette beetles were captured using a pheromone trap in 30 household kitchens in Tokyo, Saitama and Gunma prefectures from the end of July to the beginning of September, 2000. Each of the 150 captured beetles (5 beetles/house) was individually placed in a sterilization tube, with 1 ml of phosphate buffer. By shaking this tube with a touch mixer, the fungal spores adhering to the body surface of the beetle were separated. This extraction liquid was incubated on agar plates of potato dextrose (PDA), Czapek-Dox and Czapek yeast extract (CYA) at 25℃ and/or 26℃ for 5-7 days. Then, the colony grown on the plate was observed and identified on the basis of morphological characters. Consequently, 17 species of molds and about 5 species of yeasts were isolated from the body surface. Genus Aspergillus (12 isolates, 4 species) and genus Eurotium (8 isolates, 2 species) were predominant, followed by genus Penicillium (6 isolates, 4 species) and genus Arthrinium (5 isolates). Among the isolates of the toxigenic species including Aspergillus ochraceus, A. versicolor and A. fumigatus, ochratoxin A production by A. ochraceus were studied. Consequently, both isolates tested positive for toxin production. Moreover, the body surface of the cigarette beetles captured from the kitchens of 3 houses in Tokyo from the middle of August to the beginning of September 2001 was observed by a scanning electron microscope. Some fungal spores, similar to conidia of genus Aspergillus and genus Penicillium, were seen on the surface of the beetles.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies in Aichi Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams at 59 localities in winter of 1986. A total of 4,992 blackflies, [4,772 larvae (95.6% in total number) and 220 pupae (4.4%)], were collected at 40 sites. All of these blackflies were classified into fifteen species of two genera: Prosimulium Roubaud and Simulium Latreille. Four species, Prosimulium (Prosimulium) yezoense, Simulium (Nevermannia) aureohirtum, S. (N.) konoi and S. (Simulium) quinquestriatum, were newly recorded from Aichi Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (Odagmia) aokii (28.3% in total number), followed by S.(N.) uchidai (24.7%), S. (Gnus) bidentatum (16.1%), S. (S.) japonicum (13.1%) and S. (S.) rufibasis (11.0%). The most widely distributed species was S. (N.) uchidai (28 sites), followed by S. (S.) japonicum (22 sites), S. (O.) aokii (19 sites), S. (S.) rufibasis (19 sites) and S. (Gn.) bidentatum (15 sites).

N2  - Physiological and unphysiological doses of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) were injected into the hemocoel of adult female Culex pipiens pallens mosquitoes to determine if the hormone has the same effects on ovarian follicles as shown with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Separation of the secondary follicles required a single injection of 100 ng of the hormone, or double injections of 3 ng and 5 ng of the hormone 16-24 h apart, the latter two quantities nearly 100-times the ecdysteroid peak titers observed in this mosquito 6 h (32 pg) and 60 h (53 pg) after a blood meal, and also more than ten-times that needed for secondary follicle separation in Ae. aegypti. On the other hand, unphysiologically large doses of the hormone (2.5-10μg) initiated ovarian development in Cx. p. pallens as well as Ae. aegypti, but the growth did not exceed the IIa-IIb stages and all the once-activated follicles degenerated. However, the degenerating profile was apparently different from that normally occurring after a blood meal, since one or two micropyle apparatuses, which are the floating structure of mature eggs, were formed within the degenerating follicles of the hormone-treated females. Thus, while the main roles of 20E should be common among Anopheles, Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, Cx. p. pallens showed some minor specific differences in response to this hormone.

N2  - The study was carried out in central mainland Okinawa to determine the mite densities and fauna in four hospitals. One hundred and twenty-seven dust samples were collected from the floor and bedding in the hospitals in May, August and November 1996, and February 1997. The average number of mites was 30.9/m^2 for the floor and 180.0/m^2 for bedding. There was significant difference in the mite number between the floor and bedding. The genus Dermatophagoides predominated at the rate of 89.6%. In 29 out of 127 samples, Dermatophagoides farinae was more abundant than D. pteronyssinus. Blomia tropicalis was found in low frequency and in small numbers in the hospitals. Five Sarcoptes scabiei were found from a mattress and blanket in a patients room. This species was also found from a mattress and futon in the rest room for hospital staff.

Leptotrombidium scutellare was dominant, followed by L. pallidum and L. fuji. L. scutellare and L. pallidum were collected in three vegetation types. The biggest numbers of both species were recorded at the natural woods of two sites and at the grassland of one site. In Nagasaki Prefecture, four species were collected at three sites, and L. scutellare was also dominant. L. scutellare was collected in two vegetation types. The greater number of L. scutellare was recorded at the grassland of two sites and at the natural woods of one site. The distribution of L. scutellare larvae was also surveyed along roads passing through hilly and mountainous areas of both prefectures. In Kagoshima Prefecture, the collection of larval trombiculid mites with a black cloth (Suzuki's method) was carried out at 52 sites along five routes, and L. scutellare was found in 41 sites (78.8%). In Nagasaki Prefecture, the collection of larval trombiculid mites was carried out at 43 sites along five routes, and L. scutellare was found in 4 sites (9.3%). The wide occurrence and high density of vector mites seems to relate to the number of patients in Kagoshima Prefecture.

N2  - Gametocytes of malaria parasite undergo gamete formation in the mosquito midgut within minutes after ingestion of an infected blood meal. Male gametogenesis (exflagellation) of Plasmodium berghei, a rodent malaria parasite, can be induced in vitro by the combination of a reduction in temperature (from 37-39℃ in the rodent host to 21℃) and a simultaneous pH rise (from 7.3 in mouse blood to 8.0). We reported previously that the salivary gland (SG) of Anopheles stephensi (Liston) highly contained a gametocyte activating factor (GAF), which induced exfiagellation in P. berghei at the non-permissive pH. In the present study we compared exflagellation inducing activity (EIA) in the SGs of five mosquito species, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), Ae. albopictus (Skuse), An. omorii (Sakakibara), An. stephensi and Culex pipiens pallens (Coquillett). As a result, all the mosquito species examined contained GAF in the SGs. An. omorii and An. stephensi consumed more GAF than Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus and Cx. p. pallens during blood feeding, suggesting that more GAF might be introduced into the midgut of Anopheles mosquitoes. This would be one reason why only Anopheles mosquitoes can transmit mammalian malaria.

N2  - Three nests of the giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia, have been recorded for the first time in man-made structures in urban areas after 1998. One was in the wall cavity of a wooden house, one was under the floor and one was in the roof space. The nest structure was peculiar in that the top comb was strengthened with a highly developed roof envelope which had many ribbon-like pillars. The biggest nest contained 4,677 cells including 670 queen cells in 4 combs with 540 workers and the foundress queen.

N2  - In order to clarify whether or not Ixodes persulcatus Schulze nymphs reared in a long-day photoperiod before and after molting enter behavioural diapause by exposure to short-day photoperiods, their feeding activity was observed using mice at 24℃ under four photoperiodic conditions (16L-8D, 12L-12D, 11L-13D, and 10L-14D). The percentage of engorged nymphs reared at 24℃ under a 16L-8D photoperiod before and after molting was very high (74%) when they were kept under the same conditions 7-8 months after molting. However, the engorgement percentage of the nymphs became lower as the exposed day-length shortened. These results suggest that the nymphs reared in a long-day photoperiod before and after molting enter behavioural diapause by exposure to short-day photoperiods. Judging from the percentage of engorgement, however, the proportion of occurrence in the behavioural diapause appears to be low. The low occurrence of behavioural diapause may be due to the age of the nymphs.

N2  - The effect of the photoperiod on the termination of the behavioral diapause of Ixodes nipponensis Kitaoka et Saito adults reared in a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D) from egg to adult ecdysis was examined in plastic cylinders which were placed outdoors. The vertical activity in a plastic cylinder of I. nipponensis adults which were kept in a long-day photoperiod (long-day group) after they had molted (July 2000) was not found from November 2000 to mid-March 2001. However, the activity of I. nipponensis adults kept in a medium-day photoperiod (12L-12D) for about two months after molting (medium-day group) commenced in November 2000. These results suggest that the behavioral diapause of I. nipponensis adults is terminated by exposure to a medium-day photoperiod. Thus, the medium days of autumn appear to be important to the termination of the behavioral diapause of I. nipponensis adults.

N2  - In order to clarify whether or not engorged Haemaphysalis flava females exhibit morphogenetic diapause, their feeding and oviposition were observed at 24℃ under three photoperiodic conditions (10L-14D, 12L-12D, and 16L-8D). The feeding period was hardly affected by the different photoperiods. However, the oviposition was retarded by exposure to the 10L-14D photoperiod and partly by the 12L-12D photoperiod. These results suggest that engorged H. flava females enter morphogenetic diapause under medium-day and short-day photoperiods. Thus, most of the H. flava females that are active in the short days of autumn appear to enter morphogenetic diapause and eventually hibernate in the engorged state.

N2  - The reason for the recent increase of roof rat infestation in residential areas in the center of Tokyo was proved from the distribution of rats and their warfarin-resistance. Three 32 ha residential areas, site I (0-400 m), site II (800-1,200 m), site III (1,600-2,000 m) far from a commercial area, respectively, were selected for the study. Five and six roof rats were trapped indoors or outdoors in sites I and II, respectively, but no rat except a brown rat in site III. Warfarin-resistant roof rats were found from sites I and II as well as from the commercial area, These facts show that roof rats have dispersed from the commercial area to residential areas.

N2  - The present paper will describe guidelines for a malaria vector survey by public health personnel engaged in entomological work. The history of the past 100 years of taxonomic studies on Anophelini mosquitoes in Palearctic Japan is reviewed. Among the mosquitoes recorded in the area, Anopheles sinensis was considered the main vector. However no survey designed to systematically assess the presence and abundance of malaria vectors has been carried out since malaria transmission was interrupted in the Islands. There is uncertainty about many aspects of a suspected vector Anopheles lesteri, particularly its distribution. It is recommended that an occasional survey should be carried out in this region considering the possible reintroduction of malaria to the Islands.

N2  - A survey was carried out during 1998-1999 to determine the distribution and seasonal abundance of An. minimus Theobald in Ishigaki Island, Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. Larvae and pupae of An. minimus were collected in 33 of 48 streams in 1998, and 38 of 56 streams in 1999. Immatures of An. minimus were found in almost all the surveyed streams except those in urban areas, fast flowing streams and polluted streams. The abundance of immatures in Fanan and Nishihama Streams, where a lot of the immatures was collected, showed seasonal variation which was positively correlated with water temperature and rainfall. Few immatures were collected during winter season (December to February). As the temperature started to rise in March, the population increased and the density became high from May to August, and October to November, 1999. In Arakawa Stream near urban area, unlike Fanan and Nishihama Streams, the population of An. minimus immatures became biggest from March to April. By light trap method, more than 30 An. minimus adults per night were collected from March to November except May, and the highest number was 228 in July and 321 per night in November, 1999, near Nishihama Stream.

A total of 208, 395 (1, 017 pools) female Culex tritaeniorhynchus were collected and processed for virus isolation. Japanese encephalitis virus could not be detected in these mosquitoes. However, four strains of West Nile virus were detected in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected in 1986. It was concluded that the Japanese encephalitis virus does not usually come from Southeast Asia and is uncommon in the Karachi area.

N2  - A tree-hole mosquito species, Ochlerotatus (Finlaya) koreicoides has been reared in laboratory by stimulating their hatch using dried yeast powder. This method shows to be more effective than lowering the dissolved oxygen concentration by mechanical, chemical or biological means. From a hatch test guided fractionation of the water extract of dried yeast, glutamic acid was isolated as the main compound of the hatch stimulating fraction. This amino acid alone did not show hatch stimulating effect but it was effective in combination with the phosphates that are also constituents of dried yeast. Among 20 amino acids, only histidine and proline showed similar effects as glutamic acid. A concentration of 0.1mg/ml of each glutamic acid and trisodium phosphate gave high percentage hatch in 18 h.

Species examined were wild individuals of Tabanidae (Tabanus trigonus Coquillett and Hirosia iyoensis (Shiraki)), Asilidae (Cophinopoda chinensis (Fabricius) and Promachus yesonicus Bigot), and Stratiomydae (Hermetia illucens (Linnaeus)). Properties measured were distance of total flight (DIT), distance of the most sustained flight (DIS), duration of total flight (DUT), duration of the most sustained flight (DUS), speed of total flight (SPT), speed of the most sustained flight (SPS), and speed of the fast 1km flight (SPF). T. trigonus exhibited strong flight capability with mean values of DIT (8.1km), DUT (115.1min.), SPT (1.49m/sec), and maximum values of DIS (11.6km), DUS (125.9min.), SPS (2.9m/sec), and SPF (3.44m/sec). Two asilid species and H. iyoensis showed smaller values in these properties. A stratiomyid species, H. illucens, showed rather larger values, with mean values of DIT (17.5km), DUT (210.2min.), SPT (0.98m/sec), and maximum values of DIS (11.03km), DUS (238.2min.), SPS (1.2m/sec), and SPF (1.83m/sec). The maximum dispersal range at a time was 36.6km for H. illucens and 33.1km for T. trigonus, and less than 3.2km for other species. A tendency of a rapid flight as well as a long distance and propensity was recognized in T. trigonus, and a slow flight as well as a long distance and propensity in H. illucens. These properties of flights seemed to be derived from the flight pattern in their intrinsic behavior for foraging food resources. Their specialized body plans in relation to adult food habits seemed to characterize flight pattern respecting to carnivorous, bloodsuckers, nectar feeders, or scavengers.

The following seven species were recorded from Japan for the first time with an undescribed Phthiridium sp.; Ornithomya comosa, Ornithomya fuscipennis, Icosta holoptera omnisetosa, Icosta maquilingensis, Icosta sensilis sensilis, Nycteribia pleuralis, Nycteribia uenoi. Total numbers of species recorded from Japan count 26 for Hippoboscidae, 11 for Nycteribiidae and 4 for Streblidae. All the species recorded from Japan were tabulated with summarized information about hosts and distribution in Japan for each species. Host preference and geographical distribution of bat flies in Japan have become rather clear but information for species of Hippoboscidae is still fragmentary.

N2  - The calliphorid genus Dyscritomyia is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, and these flies provide another example of adaptive radiation within that archipelago. Dyscritomyia species have traditionally been considered members of the Tribe Luciliini, or greenbottle flies, although the exact systematic position of the genus has never been known. This is part of a larger problem in that the limits and systematic position of many calliphorid species are unclear, and the monophyly of the Calliphoridae itself is in dispute. As part of a larger investigation of calliphorid systematics, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of Dyscritomyia and members of the greenbottle genus Lucilia based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI+II) sequence data. The resulting cladogram had &ge;87% bootstrap support for all branches and it recovered the Lucilia species-groups that are supported by morphological criteria. Dyscritomyia was the sister lineage to Lucilia. Therefore it is unlikely that the Hawaiian genus evolved from any Lucilia species. Although these results are preliminary it appears that COI+II sequence data will provide a strong phylogenetic signal for any future investigation of Dyscritomyia and other greenbottle flies.

N2  - A mass occurrence of a parasitic blow fly, Melinda pusilla (Villeneuve, 1927), was annually observed during winter (November to March) in a modern big building of Yokosuka Electrical Communication Laboratory, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation soon after the laboratory was built on a forested hill top located in the Miura Peninsular, Kanagawa Pref. The adult flies were mainly aggregated on the combined first and second floors (1+2F) of this tall building where they entered the laboratory rooms and were a considerable nuisance. Studies were made from November 1983 to March 1984 on the number of attracted flies, the route of migration and entrance into the building, and the behavior of hibernation. The flies were unmated and were found hibernating throughout the building. However, distinct daily patterns of aggregation and movement were observed. The number of individuals increased from 11 : 00 to 13 : 00 on the outside surface of glass windows and walls, especially on the south surface of floors 1+2. In late afternoon the flies seemed to enter the eaves and rooms on the north side of floors 1+2 via small openings. Groups of 10-60 individuals were then found hibernating on the ceiling. These hibernation locations showed relatively lower air temperatures (6.0-17.5℃) and higher relative humidity (RH 22.7-50.0%) than those (9.5-22.8℃, RH 11.5-40.2%) in on the south side of the building during 13-19 December 1983. Reoccurrence of this fly problem was prevented in 1984 by sealing small openings on the north surface of the building with heat insulation foam. The life history during spring and summer and host of M. pusilla remain unknown except for the fact that copulation occurs in April.

N2  - The nomenclature of Musca carnaria Linnaeus, 1758, currently in the genus Sarcophaga Meigen, 1826, is succinctly reviewed. The original type material is discussed and argued to consist of at least one North American as well as several European specimens, with most of the latter no longer in existence. The lectotype designation and the resulting nomenclatural changes are discussed in light of recent critique. The lectotype designation is in agreement with the relevant articles of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, but by abandoning the (at that time) current usage it may arguably be considered too rigid an application of the Principle of Priority. As such, the lectotype designation may not have been optimal when proposed, yet the general acceptance in the scientific literature emerging during the last fifteen years provides hope for nomenclatural stability, and no contrary action is recommended.

N2  - The flesh fly adults of temperate colonies, Boettcherisca peregrina, lay larvae destined for non-diapause and diapause under long and short days, respectively and mature larvae destined for diapause enter diapause at the pupal stage. Mature larvae are inhibited pupariation with water immersion treatment, and the pupariation takes place after transfer from the immersed to the dry conditions. We found that 74% of the mature larvae entered diapause, when the larvae destined for non-diapause were treated with water immersion under short days at 20℃ for 13 days. Further, 60% of progeny of adult experienced diapause at pupal stage entered diapause with water immersion treatment under the same condition. Furthermore, when the progeny of diapause terminated adult fly experienced only short days was exposed only short days for all larval period, they entered diapause at a rate of 22〜23% with or without water immersion treatment. From these results, we conclude that diapause incidence on B. peregrina larvae may be dominated by short days signal exposed after larviposition, but adults have a same effect on progeny to diapause or non-diapause pupae.

N2  - Detection and serotyping of Orientia tsutsugamushi from individual unfed larval trombiculid mites, whose cuticles remained, were performed by the immunofluorescent technique in three areas including an endemic area of Tsutsugamushi disease in Kagoshima Prefecture. A total of 9,540 unfed larvae of Leptotrombidium scutellare and 31 of Helenicula miyagawai were collected by the black cloth method over 120 minutes. Of the above two species, 6,775 out of 9,571 unfed larvae were examined for O. tsutsugamushi by the immunofluorescent technique. One unfed larva L. scutellare collected from the endemic area tested positive for O. tsutsugamushi and the serotype was determined as Kawasaki type O. tsutsugamushi by the immunofluorescent technique using the serotype specific monoclonal antibody. The natural infection rate of the ethiologic agent O. tsutsugamushi to the larvae L. scutellare in one endemic area was estimated to be less than 0.05%. Moreover, a total of 71 unfed larvae consisting of four species, L. scutellare, L. fuji, L. kitasatoi and Cheladonta ikaoensis, and three adults were recovered from five soil samples from the above endemic area. Here, all mites from soil samples tested negative for O. tsutsugamushi.

N2  - The number of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157: H7 (EHEC O157) in the female housefly feces excreted on foods such as raw beef and boiled potato was counted after contact with flies 3, 24 and 48 hr after 10^6 and 10^9 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml EHEC ingestion. In the experiment of ingestion of 10^6 CFU/ml, a small number of EHEC was detected in all harvested samples just after feeding contact. EHEC O157 of 10^2-10^8 CFU were detected from the harvested food around eosin-stained excreta, when the foods were preserved overnight at 29℃ after feeding contact. EHEC O157 of 10^2-10^5 CFU were counted from the harvested food with excreta of 10^9 CFU/ml ingested flies just after food contact. The EHEC O157 in the excreta on the foods drastically proliferated ranging 10^2-10^5-fold (10^2-10^4 and 10^3-10^8 CFU) overnight at 29℃. These results suggested that the small number of EHEC O157 excreted on the foods by EHEC O157-contaminated houseflies is a possible source of food poisoning under inadequate preservation. Complete sanitary arrangements with fly-proof structure in the cooking facilities and by food manufacturers is strongly recommended.

N2  - This paper reports cutaneous myiasis on a skin cancer of a 90-year-old patient living in a nursing home for the aged in Tochigi city, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. On 21 April 2001, the nurse in charge of the patient noticed oozing from a cancer lesion on the cheek of the patient. When she removed the gauze covering the lesion, she found wriggling, milky white maggots in the lesion. Thirty-four larvae were collected from the lesion. Author S. S. identified the emerged adult flies as Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Japanese name: Hirozu-kinbae). In traditional medical practice, the larvae of some calliphorid flies, notably L. illustris, L. sericata, and Phormia regina, have been used to clean lesions antiseptically (maggot therapy), especially in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. This mode of treatment remains appropriate for cases where antibiotics are ineffective and surgery is impracticable. Similar treatment happened unintentionally in this case. The decrease in the size, cleanness of the skin cancer and elimination of odor in the present case may be due to some beneficial effects of this maggot therapy.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies in Okayama Prefecture, Japan, were examined based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and adults flying around the collectors at 74 sites in spring of 1991. A total of 4,949 blackflies, [3,675 larvae (74.3% in total number), 1,259 pupae (25.4%) and 15 adults (0.3%)], were collected at 72 sites. These blackflies were classified into 23 species of three genera : Prosimulium Roubaud, Cnephia Enderlein and Simulium Latreille. Nine species, i.e. Prosimulium (Prosimulium) kiotoense, P (P.) yezoense, Cnephia (Stegopterna) mutata, Simulium (Nevermannia) aureohirtum, S. (N) konoi, S. (N.) mie, S. (Gomphostilbia) ogatai, S. (Simulium) japonicum and S. (S.) kawamurae were newly recorded from Okayama Prefecture. Further, five undescribed and / or unidentified spcies, e.g. E. sp. 2, S. sp. H, S. sp. O-1, S. sp. O-2 and S. (Helichiella) sp., were recognized. The most abundant species was S. (N) uchidai (22.9% in total number), followed by S. (S.) arakawae (19.7%), S. (S.) japonicum (18.8%), P. (P.) kiotoense (10.9%), S. (N) subcostatum (8.1%), S. (S.) suzukii (3.6%) and S. (Gnus) bidentatum (3.3%). The most widely distributed species was S. (N) uchidai (55 sites), followed by S. (S.) japonicum (44 sites), S. (N) subcostatum (32 sites), S. (S.) arakawae (26 sites), S. (Gn.) bidentatum (26 sites), S. (S.) rufibasis (22 sites), S. (O.) aokii (17 sites) and P. (P.) kiotoense (14 sites).

N2  - Total 817 cases of tick bite were collected during 21 years from 1980 to 2000 including 261 cases without tick specimens. Tick activity started in late April and finished at the end of October, with maximum activity in June. Distribution of tick bite sites was generally recognized on the body (51.4%), but, the under-10-years-of-age group was predominantly infested in the head region including the auditory canal (81.9%). Two major tick species (Ixodes ovatus and I. persulcatus) prevailed in the low and high lands of Hokkaido. In 1990, we encountered two male cases showing erythema migrans after I. persulcatus biting. The former showed seropositive to antiborrelia antibody, but, the latter gave seronegative result. The author considered that this was a case of seronegative Lyme disease although there was no examination of the isolated agent from the skin. In 1992, erythema on the tick bite skin appeared in two female cases without tick specimens. Therefore, we attempted borrelial isolation from the skin tissues. Small pieces of skin were removed by aseptic surgery and put into BSK medium kept at 32℃. We succeeded in detecting the agents from two cases of skins. Following these cases, all of the skin with tick bite were cultured in BSK medium, especially the cases with appearance erythema case. Total 51 isolates were found from skins with erythema, two Borelia afzelii and the remainder B. garinii. All of these removed the tick by themselves with their fingers within several days, and almost all of them developed erythema except two cases, because the tick was removed from these two victims within a short period (1 or 2 days) of tick infestation. Of the 30 cases where I. persulcatus was removed surgically, the tick and the skin of the patient were checked for the presence of the Lyme disease agent. Although all the ticks were positive for the agent, no agent was found in the skin of the patients. Therefore, I considered that the transmission of agents takes place by regurgitation of spirochetes from the midgut of the tick due to the pressure by fingers. I recommend that the infested tick be removed surgically in a clinic, or by using a pair of tweezers with a firm grip around the mouthpart of the infested tick within 24 hr.

N2  - The capacity for oral infection and dissemination of two dengue type-2 viruses, ThNH7/93 and ThNHpll/93, isolated from patients exhibiting different disease severity, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and classical dengue fever (DF), respectively, was compared in two strains of Aedes aegypti from different geographic origin. The capacity for oral infection and dissemination to the head tissues of the isolate ThNH7/93 (DSS) was significantly higher in the Ae. aegypti strain from Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, than that in the strain from Escuintla, Guatemala, (P<0.05, x^2=6.833, df=1), whereas for the isolate ThNHpll/93 (DF) the capacity was not significantly different between the Ae. aegypti strains (P>0.05, x^2=0.557, df= 1). The Ae. aegypti strain from the location where the viruses were isolated (Nakhon Phanom, Thailand) showed significantly higher susceptibility to the isolate ThNH7/93 strain than to the isolate ThNHpll/93 (P<0.05, x^2=13.283, df=1), while the susceptibility to both isolate virus strains was not significantly different in the Ae. aegypti strain from Guatemala (P>0.05, x^2=0.049, df= 1). These results suggested that the efficacy of dengue virus circulation was likely to vary according to combination of the virus strains and origin of the vector mosquitoes.

N2  - Long-term field studies on Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Osaka Prefecture revealed the following points. 1) Though there were 71-346 human cases in the epidemic years of 1965-1967, the incidence of JE has markedly decreased since 1968. In addition, there has been a marked decrease in the number of districts with developed paddy fields and high density of swine farms since 1965. 2) The abundance of Culex tritaeniorhynchus decreased annually during the years 1968-1997. 3) In the 1990s the mosquitoes collected from many piggeries were not infected with the JE virus. In most of the districts, the mosquito populations may be far below the critical level for JE virus infection. 4) It was noted that the critical level of mosquito populations below which the JE virus could no longer be isolated varied according to such environmental conditions as the scarcity of paddy fields near a piggery and the breeding number of swine per piggery. As large-scale breeding farms having a large number of swine per piggery have recently been increasing, a rise in this critical level was observed. 5) In 1)-4), from the latter half of 1960s to the 1990s, the total absolute amount of infected mosquitoes in Osaka Prefecture markedly diminished, greatly reducing the possibility of JE virus transmission to humans. 6) Further, it seemed probable that according to the small number of swine per piggery, high enough density of swine farms might be necessary for producing a large absolute amount of infected mosquitoes, which in turn brought about the outbreaks of JE, in the 1960s because small-scale breeding farms were common. Thus, it seemed that the environmental condition for mosquito breeding such as the density of swine farms is one of the essential factors involving the epidemics of JE.

N2  - Neopeace F101^[○!R], Neopeace^[○!R], Polypol^[○!R] were evaluated for trapping flies at a garbage dumping ground in Malaysia. Neopeace F101^[○!R] was a more effective adhesive than Neopeace^[○!R], and Neopeace^[○!R] was more effective than Polypol^[○!R] in that order in trapping Chrysomya megacephala, Lucilia cuprina and Musca domestica. The adhesives evaluated had no or little repellent effect against the flies in the dumping ground. Thus, Neopeace F101^[○!R] could be utilised in fly control programmes.

N2  - Three strains of Aedes aegypti and 3 strains of Ae. albopictus of laboratory colonies were reared in different temperatures to compare their development in the immature stage (larval and pupal periods). The duration of developmental times of Ae. aegypti strains averaged 31.0-32.0 days at 15℃, 13.9-16.6 days at 20℃, 10.2-11.8 days at 25℃ and 7.4-8.2 days at 30℃. The developmental zero was 8.2-10.6℃ and the effective cumulative temperature was 145-176 days degree. For Ae. albopictus the duration of developmental times averaged 12.6-15.1 days at 20℃, 10.0-11.7 days at 25℃ and 7.6-8.4 days at 30℃. The developmental zero was 4.2-8.2℃ and the effective cumulative temperature was 166-214 days degree. Male adults emerged 0.2-1.0 days faster than females due to a difference in the duration of the 4th-instar larval period. Aedes aegypti that easily breeds in urban environment could be re-established if introduced in Japan.

N2  - The vertical activities of Ixodes nipponensis adults kept in the laboratory (laboratory group ; 24℃, 16L-8D photoperiod) and outdoors (outdoor group) after they had molted (July 2000) were observed in plastic cylinders which were placed outdoors. The adults of the outdoor group began to commence their activity from November 2000 and then showed high activity from March to June 2001. However, the activity of the adults in the laboratory group was rarely observed from March to June 2001. These results suggest that the behavioral diapause of the outdoor group begins to terminate in late autumn, but that of the laboratory group does not, even in the following spring. Thus, the behavioral diapause of I. nipponensis adults is not terminated with prolonged time after molting or by exposure to a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D). The behavioral diapause of I. nipponensis adults may be terminated by exposure to medium-day or short-day photoperiods.

N2  - The incidence of pupal diapause in the flesh fly, Boettcehrisca peregrina (Robineau-Desvoidy), was examined in 11 colonies originating from Japan (3 colonies), Vietnam (1), Sri Lanka (4), Indonesia (2) and Papua New Guinea (1). The Japanese, Vietnamese and Papua New Guinean colonies entered pupal diapause in response to a short-day photoperiod at 20℃, but there was a difference in diapause incidence among them. Diapause incidence in two Japanese colonies, Bp (Tokyo) and Bp (Mie), was 100% under 13L : 11D and 12L : 12D, respectively. Although the latitudinal difference was only 0.8 degree between the original localities of these colonies, they showed a large difference of 1hr 20 in in their 50% critical photoperiod of diapause incidence. Maximum diapause incidence in other colonies was 20% in Bp (Nabekawa) of Japan, 3% in Bp (Lai Chau) of Vietnam and 35% in Bp (Boroko) of Papua New Guinea. The remaining colonies, Bp (Sri A), Bp (Sri B), Bp (Adams), Bp (forest) of Sri Lanka, Bp (Luwuk) and Bp (Toili) of Indonesia did not enter diapause at any of the photoperiods examined (9L : 15D-16L : 8D). The relationship between maximum diapause incidence and latitude are discussed with 23 colonies including 12 previously studied. A population having 50% diapause incidence was estimated to be found at a latitude of 27 to 28°N in Japan.

N2  - The female sex pheromone of the house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae was identified as 2-hydroxy-6-methylbenzaldehyde (HMB). Sexual activity was induced by exposing 5-50 ng doses of synthetic HMB, while its content was estimated to be 6.47±0.69 ng per female and 0.77±0.30 ng per male. We concluded that the apparent response of males only towards females is attributed to ca. 8.4-fold difference in the HMB content between both sexes.

N2  - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity is generally detected by reversible reaction using a combination of a substrate and a coenzyme, that is lactate and NAD (NAD-dependent LDH), or pyruvate and NADH (NADH-dependent LDH). In Anopheles stephensi larvae, NAD-LDH and NADH-LDH activities were high and were easily detected after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), while in Culex pipiens molestus larvae, NADH-LDH could be detected, but NAD-LDH showed very low activity. According to enzyme histochemical studies, Cx. p. molestus had NAD-LDH at the same localities as An. stephensi did, but its activity was very low. NAD-LDH activity of Cx. p. molestus larvae is, therefore, greatly inhibited by the LDH-inhibitor, which is present in the cytosol of the gastric caeca and midgut, and also in the haemolymph. Among the eight mosquito species examined, LDH-inhibitory activity was highest in the species with low NAD-LDH activity, such as Cx. p. molestus. The LDH-inhibitor was seen to specifically inhibit NAD-LDH activity. Although lactate accumulated in An. stephensi larvae, both NAD-LDH and NADH-LDH were active in this species. While in Cx. p. molestus larvae, although neither lactate nor pyruvate was accumulated, NAD-LDH activity was very low. The LDH-glycolysis could be less active. These results suggested that Cx. p. molestus larvae use some other glycolysis.

N2  - Seven Japanese serows, Capricornis crispus, with clinical signs of mange were used for parasitological and histopathological examinations. Five of the seven animals examined were positive only for Chorioptes mites. On the other two animals, however, a mixed infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei and Chorioptes mites was observed. This Chorioptes mite was proposed as a new species, Chorioptes japonensis Takahashi et Nogami, sp. nov. Histopathologically, parakeratotic and hyperkeratotic crusts were observed in the epidermis, and many cross-sections of S. scabiei mites were also found in the focal thickened stratum corneum. Chorioptes mites were observed on all Japanese serows examined from 1975 to 1997. However, S. scabiei were only observed on the two animals examined in 1996 and 1997. Before then, S. scabiei were not observed.

N2  - Poisoning symptoms caused by three acaricides and one insecticide in the acarid mite, Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank), were classified into two types, i. e. knock-down and immobilization. Since the immobilization was not preceded by hyper-excitation, convulsion or agony, an interference with the respiratory system was speculated. By analogy of certain acaricides known to produce similar poisoning symptoms in the two-spotted spider mite by inhibition of oligomycin-sensitive (=OS) Mg^<2+> ATPase involved in the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme system, ATPase activities and their inhibition by several compounds in the acarid mite were investigated in vitro. The mitochondrial preparation exhibited the highest activity for Na^+-K^+ ATPase, while the activity for OS Mg^<2+> ATPase was relatively low. Among several compounds tested, the selective acaricides, dicofol and cyhexatin, exhibited the highest inhibition of both ATPase activities. Bis (2,3,3,3-tetrachloropropyl) ether (=S-421) and pp'-DDT also exhibited significant but less inhibition of the enzymes. However, there was no consistent trend implicating a relation between in vitro OS Mg^<2+> ATPase inhibition and the in vivo immobilization symptom, except dicofol. With dicofol, the highest inhibition of the enzyme activity coincided with the highest immobilization symptom.

N2  - Karyological survey showed that the Oceanian-type black rat (Rattus rattus; chromosome number 2n=38) was distributed in Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan. All of 18 rats trapped in Port Otaru in 1999 and 2000 were this type, whereas 78 other rats collected in other ports of Japan were Asian type (Rattus rattus; 2n=42/41). The Oceanian-type population in Otaru is suggested to have originated from rats that had recently escaped from foreign vessels that called at the port. This is the first record of the Oceanian-type black rat in the mainland of Japan.

N2  - The biology of Anopheles saperoi Bohart and Ingram was studied for colonization in the laboratory. Reared under "non-aeration" and "drip" methods, the larval periods were 10.4±1.0 days and 13.8±1.2,while the pupation rates were 80.5% and 95.3%, respectively. With standard food quantity (12mg of mixture of mouse pellets and dry yeast for 1st-instar, 25mg for 2nd-, 50mg for 3rd- and 75mg for 4 th-instar larvae per half day), the pupation rate was 95.3%, and the emergence rate 95.0%. With 100 pairs in a 30×60×60cm size cage, the insemination rate was above 85% and as high as 91.7% from 10 to 15 days old. The feeding rate of the females 14 days after emergence was 37.0% when offered hairless mice. One female laid an average of 203.0±71.4 eggs. The survival rates of males and females at the 4th week after emergence were 75.0% and 78.0%, respectively. The longevity of the species was high in both sexes.

N2  - A new index concerning acceptability of unpoisoned baits was worked out and applied to study the food preference of the roof rat, Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769). The index is shown as a formula, Acceptability (A)-index={(x-y)/(x+y)}×100,where x and y are the average intakes of alternative baits. Then, the formula was tested for the preferences in placement, coloration and kinds of baits. Both of these species showed the tendency to take the bait in one side more than the other side, and the average of absolute values of the A-index was as high as 22.1 in the roof rat and 17.9 in the Norway rat, respectively. Therefore, in the other choice tests, I exchanged the position of two baits daily to minimize partiality due to the influence of the food position. In the choice test on coloration of baits, there was little difference between red-colored and uncolored seeds in the intake of the roof rat (average A-index=-5.4). Although the Norway rat had a tendency to prefer red to uncolored seed (average A-index=17.8), the sample size of the A-index was only 5,and the 95% confidence limit was considerably wide. Therefore, it seemed that there was minimal effect of red coloration on the rats. In the choice test between whole rice flour and mixed powdered feed, although the roof rats showed the tendency to take one of two feed types, they entirely preferred the latter to the former (average A-index=-21.9). In conclusion, the A-index could be used as a method for estimating food preference of the commensal rat, and, moreover, it is hoped that the A-index would be used to estimate the acceptability of rodenticides in choice tests of the rats.

N2  - New mosquito traps were devised : electroshock and adhesive traps using carbon dioxide and heat for attracting and killing mosquitoes. The electroshock trap is supplied with carbon dioxide by a portable cylinder and with heat and high voltage by electric power. The adhesive trap is supplied with carbon dioxide by dry ice and with heat by heating chemical (hand warmer). Outdoor experiments were carried out in August and September in a shrine of Kitakyushu City, Japan and in February in the outskirts of Bangkok City, Thailand. A total of 899 mosquitoes were collected with 2 or 3 adhesive traps in 4 nights in Kitakyushu (maximum of 213,minimum of 24 and average of 89.9 mosquitoes per trap-night), and Aedes albopictus accounted for 99% of the captured mosquitoes. As many as 5,408 mosquitoes were captured with 3 adhesive traps in 4 nights in Bangkok (maximum of 1,003,minimum of 114 and average of 450.7 mosquitoes per trap-night), and most (99%) of the captured mosquitoes were identified as Culex quinquefasciatus. A total of 8,133 mosquitoes were captured with 2 electroshock traps in 4 nights in Bangkok (maximum of 1,519,minimum of 1,031 and average of 1,293.8 mosquitoes per trap-night).

N2  - Effects of blood sources on fertility and the ovariole maturation rate (proportion of ovarioles which produced mature eggs to total ovarioles) were studied in a malaria vector, Anopheles farauti Laveran, in the Solomon Islands. Blood of different mammals affected fertility and ovariole maturation rate. In the number of eggs and the rate, the difference was significant between females fed on humans and those fed on rats. Wild females of An. farauti had a mean of 140.5 eggs when fed on humans, compared to 216.1 with rats. A mean of 57.7% and 91.5% of total ovarioles produced mature eggs in females fed on humans and rats, respectively. The mean number of eggs and the ovariole maturation rate were not significantly different between the females fed on humans and those fed on dogs. Females obtained from a laboratory colony showed the same tendencies as wild females.

Bishop Museum, Hawaii. C. hirtula was formerly regarded as a cosmopolitan species, but I could not find it among these specimens. On the other hand, C. rufifrons is widespread in these regions. The records of C. hirtula in Micronesia by Richards (1963) were misidentified, and they were all rectified to C. rufifrons.

N2  - In order to clarify whether or not engorged Amblyomma testudinarium Koch nymphs exhibit morphogenetic diapause, their development was observed at 25℃ under four photoperiodic conditions (10L-14D, 11L-13D, 12L-12D, and 16L-8D). The molting of the engorged nymphs was little affected by the exposure to 12L-12D and 16L-8D photoperiods. However, the molting was retarded or arrested by the exposure to 10L-14D and 11L-13D photoperiods. These results suggest that engorged A. testudinarium nymphs enter morphogenetic diapause under short-day photoperiods. Judging from the percentage of molting, their critical photoperiod for the induction of diapause appeared to be close to 11hr. Thus, a part of the A. testudinarium nymphs that are active in autumn enter morphogenetic diapause and hibernate in the engorged state.

N2  - In a preliminary test, male German cockroach evacuated a mean number of 14 drops of feces and the female 11 drops per day, when they were maintained with water and dried mouse food. The feces were deposited at the circumference of the arena (radius 15cm, height 17cm, and area 706.5(cm)^2) in the case of absence of any harborages. In the harborage test, adult German cockroaches were maintained in the same arena with a harborage made of plywood panels, with water and mouse food. Light regimen was 14L : 10D, and the temperature was maintained at approximately 25℃ throughout the test period. When the arena was divided equally into four sections : water, food, insecticide-free harborage, and blank, 90% of the feces of five cockroaches both male and female was deposited in the harborage section, and the remaining 10% deposited in the other sections during a 2-day period. After treatment with 0.05% permethrin or propoxur on the surface of the harborages, the number of their feces dramatically decreased, and no cockroaches were killed within 24hrs. When harborages were treated with 0.05% micro-encapsulated fenitrothion and diazinon, the percentage of the number of the feces in the harborage section did not decrease markedly, and a majority of the cockroaches was killed. The distribution of German cockroach feces is indicative of the presence of aggregations. The presence of feces may serve as an indicator of the repellent qualities of cockroach control insecticides.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of chironomid midges in Ueda City were investigated based on the collections of adults attracted to automatic vending machines at 108 stations in the summer and at 103 stations in the fall of 1997. A total of 3,371 chironomid midges, 1,346 males and 2,025 females, was collected from the stations in both seasons. All of these chironomid midges were classified into 97 species belonging to four subfamilies, i. e., 61 species of Chironominae, one species of Diamesinae, 29 species of Orthocladiinae and six species of Tanypodinae. The most abundant species was Polypedilum nubifer (Skuze), which was collected at 60 stations, followed by Chironomus kiiensis Tokunaga (53 stations), Cricotopus triannulatus (Macquart) (52 stations) and Cryptochironomus albofasciatus (Staeger) (50 stations) in summer. On the other hand, in fall, the most abundant species was Smittia aterrima (Meigen), which was collected at 75 stations, followed by P. convictum (Walker) (52 stations). The collected chironomid midges reflected the environmental condition of the collection site. Thus, the number of species collected in summer was larger than that in fall, and the respective number of terrestrial species was increased in fall. In addition, the fauna of chironomid midges and their distribution patterns in Ueda City changed during both seasons.

N2  - A nationwide survey of flies (mainly house flies) carrying enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157 was undertaken in 15 prefectures during late spring-late summer in 1997. EHEC-carrying flies were collected from 53% (8/15) of the prefectures. These positive flies were found from the northern (Hokkaido) to southern prefectures (Okinawa). The flies were collected at 210 sites in 15 prefectures and EHEC-carrying flies were confirmed at 15 (7.1%) sites (cattle farm, 11/140 and slaughter house, 4/19). The average rate of EHEC-carrying flies to the total number of flies collected at the 15 positive-sites was 7.2%. The EHEC-carrying flies were 23/4161 (0.55%) house flies and 3/967 (0.31%) other flies. The serotypes and toxin types of EHEC isolates in 26 EHEC-positive flies were O157 : H7 : VT 2 (16/26), O157 : H7 : VT1+VT2 (8/26), O26 : H11 : VT1 (1/26) and O115 : H10 : VT1 (1/26), respectively.

N2  - Preliminary field experiments were conducted to examine the exophagy of Aedes albopictus in peridomestic habitat by using three different types of experimental buildings in Nagasaki, Japan and Chiangmai, Thailand. The density of females collected by suction traps enhanced by CO_2 was high inside net-walled buildings and at outdoor sites with vegetation. On the other hand, the densities inside a normal walled building and at outdoor sites without vegetation, the microclimate conditions of both of which were different from the outdoor sites with vegetation, were low. To evaluate the effect of blocking by walls for Ae. albopictus invading to feed, an additional experiment by using a bamboo hut with openings of different sizes in the walls was conducted in Thailand. As the opening in the walls was smaller, the difference in the number of females between inside and outside of the hut became significantly larger. Therefore, the effect of physical blocking by walls was suggested. We proposed the presence of vegetation, the difference in environmental conditions inside buildings from those in vegetation due to blocking, and physical blocking by walls for invasion as ecological factors influencing the exophagy of Ae. albopictus.

N2  - Between March and August 1995,the prevalence of Lyme disease Borrelia in ticks and rodents in the Kuju Mountains and Sobo Mountains, the highest mountainous areas in the northern half of Kyushu, and also on the Tsushima Islands in the Korean Strait was surveyed. All 20 isolates obtained consisted of 2 Borrelia garinii (pattern C'-C on RFLP analysis) from Ixodes persulcatus from Kuju, 13 B. japonica from I. ovatus and rodents from Kuju and Sobo, 1 B. turdi from I. turdus and 4 B. tanukii from rodents from Tsushima. All these are the first official records from this region. This evidence of Borrelia is suggestive, considering their dispersal from the eastern China and Korean areas to southwestern Japan, based on biogeographical knowledge.

N2  - Chironomid fauna in slow sand filter beds were investigated and compared with those at two different water filtration plants; one in southwestern Japan, i. e., the Sakishima Islands, and the other in a plateau area, i. e., Honshu Island. As a result, the midges were found to be dominated by three taxa, Cricotopus, Paratrichocladius rufiventris and Tanytarsus oyamai at two filtration plants in the center of Honshu Island. On the other hand, in the Sakishima Islands, the most abundant species was Polypedilum nubifer, which was also collected on Honshu Island. In addition, we recorded two chironomid species from the Sakishima Islands.

N2  - The number of species of insect family Chironomidae breeding in Japan is very large, and more than one thousand species have already been recorded from this small country, including many new species. In the Monograph of Chironomidae by Sasa and Kikuchi (1995), a total of 757 species was recorded, among which only 131 were those already recorded from Europe, Americas, and other regions outside of Japan and East Asia, and in another monograph compiled by Sasa (1998), 176 species were added. In the present paper, additional 241 species recorded from Japan in 20 papers published as of July 2000 are recorded by according to taxonomic groups making the total number of Chironomidae of Japan 1,174.

N2  - The main strategy for elimination of filariasis is transmission interruption through mass drug administration (MDA) however, it is important to argue that knowledge of vector species distribution and biting density is important for the impact of an intervention. In this paper, first the epidemiology of lymphatic filariasis in Samoa is examined, followed by a description of the bionomics and transmission potential of the vector mosquitoes, Aedes polynesiensis and Aedes samoanus. Then the role of entomology in a MDA based filariasis elimination programme is examined.

N2  - Injection of validoxylamine A (VAA), a specific trehalase inhibitor, suppressed oocyte development in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. Trehalases of the ovary, accessory gland and fat body in the cockroach were strongly inhibited by the injection of VAA. Elevation of hemolymph trehalose concentration was observed indicating inhibition of trehalose metabolism in the tissues. In control cockroaches, vitellin accumulated in the ovary in parallel with oocyte development, and the amount of vitellogenin in the hemolymph changed showing negative correlation with the uptake of vitellogenin to the ovary. In VAA-injected cockroaches, vitellogenin production was suppressed in the early stage of oocyte development; uptake of vitellogenin by the ovary reduced in the late stage and, consequently, vitellogenin accumulated in the hemolymph. It is concluded from these results that the primary effect of VAA occurs in the vitellogenin production and the vitellogenin intake for the oocyte development.

N2  - The influence of paddy field development on the population of the roof rat, Rattus rattus, was assessed in West Timor (August 1998 and 1999,dry season; February 2000,wet season) and Central Sulawesi (August 1998,wet season), Indonesia. In West Timor, the rats foraged houses and their vicinities but not paddy fields in the early vegetative stage either in August or in February. In West Timor in August, 48% of the sampled rats was estimated to have been born during the harvest-time in or just after the wet season from May to June. Meanwhile, in Central Sulawesi, the rats foraged paddy fields in the generative stage, and those born during the preceding two months amounted to 47%. These results suggest that the roof rat reproduced actively around paddy fields during the harvest-time in or just after the wet season and moved to houses after the harvest. Probably, the development of paddy fields motivates the rat to migrate between houses and paddy fields, and activates its reproduction.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and adults flying around the collectors at 136 sites in autumn of 1997. A total of 20,735 blackflies, 18,232 larvae (87.9% in total number), 2,492 pupae (12.0%) and 11 adults (0.1%), were collected at 131 sites. All these blackflies were classified into 19 species of two genera : Prosimulium Roubaud and Simulium Latreille. Four species, Simulium (Nevermannia) aureohirtum, S. (Simulium) quinquestriatum, S. (Gnus) nacojapi and S. (Eusimulium) sp. H were newly recorded from Nagano Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (S.) japonicum (27.4% in total number), followed by S. (S.) kawamurae (17.6%), S. (Odagmia) aokii (17.3%), S. (N.) uchidai (14.9%), S. (O.) iwatense (10.1%) and S. (Gn.) bidentatum (5.6%). The most widely distributed species was S. (S.) japonicum (77 sites), followed by S. (N.) uchidai (71 sites), S. (O.) aokii (58 sites), S. (S.) suzukii (51 sites), S. (S.) kawamurae (44 sites), S. (Gn.) bidentatum (33 sites), S. (O.) iwatense (30 sites) and S. (N.) subcostatum (26 sites).

N2  - During autumn 1995 to 1999,we searched for Leptotrombidium scutellare, one of trombiculid mite species known as tsutsugamushi disease vector, by the black cloth method, the Tullgren funnel method, and inspection of host rodents in western Japan, mainly in endemic areas of the disease. The mite species was recorded for the first time from western Japan, i.e., Tanabe (Wakayama Pref.), Ooya (Hyogo Pref.), the western part of Hiroshima Pref. and Ootoyo (Kochi Pref.). These results strongly suggest that L. scutellare may be a widely distributed disease vector throughout western Japan.

The former two species have not been previously reported to cause dermatitis whereas the latter species has been previously reported to cause dermatitis in Japan. As a result of the survey, a total of 11 species of Oedemeridae are now known to cause dermatitis in Japan.

N2  - Parasitological and histopathological examinations were performed on two raccoon dogs, Nyctereutes procyonoides, with severe dermatosis, taken from Saitama and Gunma Prefectures. These raccoon dogs were infected with a great number of Sarcoptes scabiei, but not with Demodex. Histopathologically, marked parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis and acanthosis were observed. Cross sections of many S. scabiei were observed in the stratum corneum, and hair follicles contained keratinous plugs instead of hair.

N2  - The activities of Ixodes persulcatus adults kept in the laboratory (laboratory group; 24℃, 16L-8D photoperiod) and outdoors (outdoor group) after they had molted (June, 1999) were observed in plastic cylinders which were placed outdoors. The adults of the outdoor group commenced their activity from March, 2000 and then showed high activity. However, the activity of the adults in the laboratory group was rarely found from March to May, 2000. These results suggest that the behavioural diapause of the outdoor group terminates in the spring, but that of the laboratory group does not. Thus, the behavioural diapause of I. persulcatus adults is not terminated with prolonged time after molting or by exposure to a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D).

Trials were conducted from October 26 to November 3,1999,near the hyper-eutrophic Lake Suwa in central Japan. The swarm of P. akamusi formed at 1m to over 10m above ground and was observed from 15 : 10-17 : 20. More than 93% of P. akamusi caught from the swarm were males. In cylindrical sound traps, optimal trapping of swarming males occurred at frequencies of 150-180Hz at 13.8±3.1℃.

N2  - "Futon" (Japanese mattress) was divided lengthwise into two equal halves to compare mite numbers collected by different methods. Mites were collected by different kinds of vacuum cleaners. No significant difference was found in the number of mites collected by three kinds of vacuum cleaners with vacuuming power of 230W, 340W and 500W, respectively. There was significant difference between the mite numbers collected by using commercial cleaner bags and those using handmade small bags. When a cleaner of 340W vacuuming power was used with commercial bags for collecting mites from "futon", blankets and "tatami" for a period of 120sec., more than 39.8% of total mites was collected during the first 30seconds. However, from carpets, the number of mites collected every ten seconds did not vary.

The dung-burying activity of the dung beetle caused the emergent fly to be reduced to about 90% in number and about 20% in size. The results suggest that D. gazella could compete well with the fly, and be used as a biological control agent.

N2  - A commercial corn-grit (CG) formulation of Bacillus sphaericus serotype H5a5b (strain 2362) (VectoLex^[○!R] CG) and a corncob granular (G) formulation of B. thuringiensis serovar. israelensis (B.t.i.) (VectoBac^[○!R] G) were evaluated at various treatment rates against Culex quinquefasciatus Say larvae in organically polluted roadside ditches and ponds in suburban Dhaka, Bangladesh. VectoBac G at rates of 11.2 and 22.4kg/ha gave short-lived larval reduction (76%) of all instars of Cx. quinquefasciatus for 3 days, declining rapidly to 3% at day 7 posttreatment with the lower rate, but up to 62-88% larval reductions for 7-10 days posttreatment at the higher rate of treatment which is the maximum allowable label use rate in the USA. In contrast, VectoLex CG was more effective and even at 5.6kg/ha gave 67-97% larval reductions of 3rd and 4th instar Cx. quinquefasciatus for at least 17 days posttreatment. At higher rates of 11.2 and 22.4kg/ha (maximum allowable label use rate in the USA), VectoLex CG gave control of higher magnitude and duration in the various habitats; specifically, at 22.4kg/ha, an excellent or complete control of 3rd and 4th instar Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae was achieved for nearly 5 weeks posttreatment. B. sphaericus and B.t.i., because of their effectiveness, environmental safety and other positive attributes, could be substituted to chemical control agents for larval control of Cx. quinquefasciatus in the Dhaka area, and in Bangladesh at large.

N2  - The ventral nerve cord of female imagines of P. americana was cut off between the third thoracic and the first abdominal segments to examine the function of the central nervous system in controlling oviposition. When the ventral nerve cord was cut off within three days after emergence, the females each produced only 2.3 ootheca in 90days (12.5% of that of the control group). When the ventral nerve cord was cut off on day 30 after emergence, the females almost stopped ovipositing despite the fact that they had normal oviposition on the previous day. Those females each produced only 1.4 ootheca in 60 days after the surgery. All the oothecae produced after the cutoff were malformed without eggs. These results suggest that the information or directive concerning ovulation may be transmitted through the ventral nerve cord in P. americana.

N2  - Repellent and lethal effects of 7 chemicals on house dust mites, Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes (=Df) and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (=Tp), were evaluated with mite-rearing culture and mite individuals. Papers, treated with phenyl salicylate and (1R, 2R, 4R)-born-2-yl 2-thiocyanoacetate (=IBTA) at a dosage of 0.05g(AI)/m^2,inhibited >80% of Df and Tp from creeping up from the mite-rearing culture. Benzyl benzoate and diethyltoluamide (=deet) at 0.5g/m^2 also indicated >80% repellent rates against 2 mite species. However, the repellent rates of fenitrothion for Tp and that of bis (2,3,3,3-tetrachloropropyl) ether for Df were less than 60% even at 5g/m^2. IBTA at 5g/m^2 demonstrated the longest residual activity, showing >90% repellent rates for 65 days. Fast-acting effect was evaluated by observations of mite individuals on the chemical dry film at a dosage of 0.002g/16(cm)^2. Benzyl benzoate, IBTA, deet for Df and deet for Tp immobilized >90% of the test mites within 30 min. From the symptoms and behavioral changes of the mites on the chemical dry film, the test chemicals were classified into knock down type and immobilizer type. It was found that benzyl benzoate, IBTA and deet immobilized the mites, but a few were knocked down. It was suggested that there were different intoxication mechanisms in the test chemicals.

N2  - To evaluate the ability of hatching larvae of the Indian-meal moth, Plodia interpunctella Hubner, to reach their food, open food containers (3cm diameter, 5cm height) and closed ones with a pinhole of 0.495mm diameter in each cap were exposed to them. When the food containers were 10cm distant from eggs, 100% hatching larvae reached the food and 31% of the invading larvae were found in the closed containers (with a pinhole). When the distance was 38cm, 65% larvae reached the food, and among them 79% and 21% were found in the open and closed containers (with a pinhole), respectively. Two kinds of cap films, polyethylene and vinylidene chloride polymer films, gave similar numbers of invading larvae when each had a pinhole. The results indicate that even first instar larvae would contaminate food containers 38cm distant by invading them through pinholes.

N2  - The feeding and development of Amblyomma testudinarium Koch larvae on the lizard, Takydromus tachydromoides (Schlegel) were observed at 24℃ under a 16L-8D photoperiod and compared with those of the larvae on mice. The mean feeding periods of the larvae were 13.7 and 5.4 days on the lizards and the mice, respectively. The mean feeding period on the lizards was significantly longer than that on the mice. However, the molting success of the engorged larvae was 97% or more on both hosts. The mean developmental periods of the engorged larvae were 22.4 and 22.6 days on the lizards and the mice, respectively. The difference in the mean developmental period between the two hosts was not significant, suggesting that the difference in the host suitability between the two hosts is slight. Thus, the reasons why the immature ticks of A. testudinarium infest more frequently on mammals than on reptiles can not be explained by the difference in the host suitability between the cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.

N2  - Human dermatosis caused by the bite of trombiculid mite larvae, Leptotrombidium intermedium, was observed by exposing the larvae to the skin of two volunteers (A and B). A total of forty unfed larvae were exposed to the forearm of A. Six larvae bit, but five out of the six detached within 45min. postinfestation. Only one larva enlarged, fully engorged, and detached itself by 66hrs. postinfestation. On the site of the infestation, a vesicle with pain and itchiness appeared. A total of ninety unfed larvae were exposed to B. Only one out of ninety unfed larvae engorged and dropped off by 72hrs. postinfestation. Instead of a vesicle, a small erythematous macule with slight pruritus was noticed at the bitten site. Moreover, the feeding period of infesting mites on human skin was almost the same as that on mice, but the infesting ratio to human skin was much lower than that of mice.

N2  - Control of vector mosquitoes breeding in rice fields is important in rice production areas which are still expanding worldwide. Control of rice field mosquitoes is difficult due to the extensive rice field areas including natural, artificial and social heterogeneity and wide flight ranges of the adult mosquitoes. Although the necessity of integrated management has been well recognized, there have been established no practical methodologies for rice field mosquito control. With the hope of overcoming this situation, I propose a concept of horizontal integration. Heterogeneity and wide flight ranges are prerequisites for implementation of horizontal integration. The salient feature of horizontal integration is to practice a single control measure at each subarea (for example, one village) but at all subareas throughout the entire target area. Each subarea selects a single measure that is easiest to be implemented there technically and also from socio-economic aspects so that control measures are not overlapped in each subarea. This contrasts with vertical integration in which multiple control measures are overlapped at one locality. For control of rice field mosquitoes and diseases transmitted by them, horizontal integration has advantages with respect to control effectiveness, practicability, economy, biodiversity preservation and community participation.

N2  - Unfed trombiculid mites were collected from endemic areas for detection and isolation of Orientia tsutsugamushi. The mites were compressed between a pair of slide glasses to make samples of the cuticles and smears of the tissues. Mite species were identified by observation of the cuticles, and infection with O. tsutsugamushi was examined in the tissues by improved immunofluorescent microscopy. The microorganisms were detected not only in Leptotrombidium pallidum but also in 0.17% of L. intermedium collected in Kyoto Prefecture. One strain of O. tsutsugamushi was isolated from 146 L. intermedium collected in Niigata Prefecture. Analyses of virulence to mice, antigenicity and nucleotide sequence of the 56 KDa type-specific antigen gene indicated that the isolate is closely related to a strain isolated from a patient in Niigata.

N2  - Five chironomid species of the genus Polypedilum were examined for their larval oxygen consumption rates, survival in anaerobic conditions, and contents and compositions of Hb by laboratory experiments. They showed different respirational properties in accordance with their respective habitat conditions. The mean oxygen consumption rate was the highest for P. masudai, an oligotrophic lake species, and the lowest for P. nubifer, an eutrophic lake species. The mean survival rate of P. asakawaense, another species from oligotrophic waters, was decreased to about 10% within 10hrs after anaerobic exposure whereas that of P. nubifer remained about 15% even 40hrs after exposure. Fifty % survival time was the longest for P. nubifer and the shortest for P. asakawaense. P. masudai had a similar Hb pattern to P. japonicum in PAGE. None of the other 3 species showed a similar pattern to the former two species, and remarkable differences were observed among the 3 species. Some Hb bands were common to two to all species whereas some were specific to a particular species. Hb contents under the rearing condition of 0.4% milk-containing agar were about twice and 1.4 times higher than those under the condition of 0.08% milk for P. asakawaense and for P. nubifer, respectively. Hb content under the condition of 2% milk was lower than those under the conditions of 0.08 and 0.4% milk for P. cultellatum. Some Hb bands appeared with the increase of milk content for all 3 species examined, suggesting their roles in an efficient transportation of oxygen molecules from oxygen-poor environments.

N2  - Insecticide resistance of houseflies inhabiting a poultry ranch in Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture was studied from 1982 to 1998. An outbreak of houseflies in 1989 proved to be highly resistant to permethrin, with the LD_<50> value of 67 times that of the susceptible fly. They were also resistant to organophosphorus (OP) compounds. The LD_<50> value of the field-collected colony in 1989 increased 140 times the resistance ratio for permethrin by succesive treatments of permethrin for 5 generations (Hachinohe R). Houseflies taken from a poultry ranch in Tojo Cho, Hiroshima Prefecture showed drastic development of permethrin-resistance, with the LD_<50> value of 10.1μg per female (673 times that of the susceptible fly). The testing result on the Hachinohe R strain indicates that a recessive kdr gene might participate to develop pyrethroid-resistance. The resistance ratios to Insect Growth Regulators were low or moderate.

N2  - In order to clarify the effect of photoperiod on growth in the Japanese cockroach, Periplaneta japonica (Karny), an experiment was carried out under different photoperiods at 20℃ and 25℃. In the short photoperiod (LD 8 : 16hr or LD 12 : 12hr), the development in the younger nymphal stages was retarded. In the photoperiod of 13hrs or longer, the ratio of adult emergence was the highest at LD 16 : 8hr. But the development of some of nymphs was retarded in the middle or older nymphal stages. When nymphs in prolonged 3rd or 4th nymphal stage were transferred from LD 8 : 16hr to LD 16 : 8hr photoperiodic shifts, they began to emerge again within two weeks. On the contrary, when 5th nymphs were transferred from long-day to short-day, the development in 8th or 9th (final) instar was retarded. Moreover, when some of them were transferred to long-day again, the adult emergence was accelerated and more synchronized. When the final or extra instar nymphs were transferred from outdoor conditions to experimental conditions during the winter months, the twice-overwintering nymphs required longer time for adult emergence in LD 13 : 11hr than LD 14 : 10hr at the beginning of winter especially. Contrarily, there was no significant difference in the once-overwintering nymphs between LD 13 : 11hr and LD 14 : 10hr. It was suggested that there was a difference in intensity of diapause between twice-overwintering nymphs and one-overwintering ones. On the other hand, it seemed that photoperiod did not affect the stage of the embryonic development.

N2  - To clarify the tempo-spatial variation in feeding of Aedes albopictus, a field investigation was conducted in a field where the species heavily infested, in Nagasaki. Feeding activity was observed in the nighttime as well as at dawn and dusk. The density was high at sites with vegetation and low at sites without vegetation and indoors. At sites with vegetation, the proportion of females decreased at dawn and dusk, while it increased at sites without vegetation and indoors. Feeding activity in nighttime is possibly common in Ae. albopictus, and the place of feeding expands from sites with vegetation to sites without vegetation and indoors at dawn and dusk.

N2  - We surmised that the dispersal of roof rats, Rattus rattus, from commercial areas was the primary cause of the recent increase of rat infestation in residential areas in the center of Tokyo. Questionnaires received from 322 residences randomly chosen in Shinagawa Ward proved that roof rats had invaded 75 (23.3%) of them within the past two years. Detached houses with roof rat infestation were significantly closer to commercial areas than those without rodent invasion (P=0.016).

N2  - Transectional distributions of chironomid larvae were investigated at 14 sampling stations covering the estuaries of 7 rivers, all flowing into Hiroshima Bay. Benthic sediments were quantitatively sampled at 3 different levels along the transectional line at each station, i. e., a submerged level at ebb (S), a water level at ebb (Z) and a dried-up level at ebb (D), and emerging male adults from the sediment samples were identified. A total of 183 males, belonging to 31 species, were collected. Procladius simplicistilus, Rheopelopia eximia, Cricotopus bicinctus, C. bimaculatus, Paratrichocladius rufiventris, Chironomus salinarius, Dicrotendipes enteromorphae, Nilothauma brayi and Tanytarsus yunosecundus occurred only in S. Chironomus nipponensis, Polypedilum masudai and Stictochironomus pictulus occurred only in Z. Cricotopus sylvestris, Paratendipes tamayubai, Polypedilum japonicum, Cladotanytarsus vanderwulpi and Tanytarsus unagiseptimus occurred only in D. On the other hand, Chironomus kiiensis, C. yoshimatsui and Dicrotendipes flexus occurred in all the levels. These results suggest that there are transectional habitat-segregations in estuaries among the species in relation to their resistance to salinity and dessication.

From those ticks, the fresh tick was examined for Lyme disease spirochetes. The agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia garinii, was isolated from the larval stage of Ixodes persulcatus ticks fed on Emberiza rustica and E. spodocephala in Morioka, Iwate Prefecture. This is a newly recorded avian reservoir for Lyme disease spirochete in the northern part of Honshu Island of Japan.

N2  - Resistance level to warfarin was evaluated among 11 colonies of brown rats, Rattus norvegicus, collected in Tokyo (Shinjuku and Hino), Kanagawa (Sagamihara, Yokohama and Kawasaki), Chiba (Chiba and Funabashi), Ibaraki (Kashima), Aichi (Nagoya), Osaka (Osaka) and No. 2-Kaiho (the 2nd fortress islet) on Tokyo Bay, and three strains of laboratory rats (Wistar, SD and F344). Flour-type baits containing 0.005% (w/w) warfarin were given to them for six days. The average lethal days and dose (a. i.) in brown rats were 7.0 days and 20.0mg/kg in the Shinjuku colony; 7.3 days and 9.5mg/kg in the Hino colony; 6.1 days and 13.5mg/kg in the Sagamihara colony; 8.6 days and 17.5mg/kg in the Yokohama colony; 4.0 days and 12.5mg/kg in the Kawasaki colony; 6.4 days and 13.0mg/kg in the Chiba colony; 6.8 days and 11.5mg/kg in the Funabashi colony; 6.3 days and 19.5mg/kg in the Kashima colony; 6.4 days and 11.5mg/kg in the Nagoya colony; 6.1 days and 12.0mg/kg in the Osaka colony; 5.6 days and 16.5mg/kg in the No. 2-Kaiho colony, with the average of 6.4 days and 13.0mg/kg, respectively. With regard to the laboratory rats, the average lethal days and dose were 6.3 days and 14.0mg/kg in the Wistar strain; 6.3 days and 17.5mg/kg in the SD strain; 6.1 days and 17.5mg/kg in the F344 strain, respectively. One rat survived the complete experimental period of 1 month in the Funabashi, Nagoya and No.2-Kaiho Island colonies. If the lethal day was used for the determination of resistance according to the recommended WHO guidelines, these colonies were judged as resistant to warfarin. However, the mortality rate of the rat populations within 12 days indicated no resistance to warfarin in these colonies. As a result of the present survey, it is suggested that use of 12 days as the lethal day be newly proposed for the determination of resistance to warfarin.

N2  - We report here three Japanese patients who suffered tick bites while travelling overseas : a female Ixodes holocyclus in Sydney, Australia, a nymph Dermacentor sp. in Malaysia and a female Dermacentor andersoni in New Hampshire, U. S. A. No infectious illness was observed in the three patients (two males and one female) after the ticks were removed.

N2  - The feeding activity of Haemaphysalis longicornis nymphs that were reared at 24℃ under a 16L-8D photoperiod from egg to engorged larva and then placed outdoors was observed under laboratory conditions (24℃, 16L-8D). The rate of engorgement of the nymphs fed on rabbits was high in October (about one month after molting) but decreased from November (about two months after molting). The rate of engorgement of the nymphs that were reared in the laboratory (24℃, 16L-8D) from egg to unfed nymph was high from October through December. These results suggest that behavioural diapause, which is induced by the short days of autumn, occurs in H. longicornis nymphs that have been placed outdoors. However, the rate of engorgement of the nymphs was more than 20% even in December. Thus, the proportion of the nymphs which enter diapause in autumn appears to be low.

N2  - Blood-sucking insects have bio-active substances in the salivary glands. These substances have activities on host blood coagulation system, hemostasis and blood vessel. Recently many of those molecules were isolated and characterized, and some of their genes have been cloned. We extracted and purified multiple hemoproteins from the salivary glands of reduviid bug, Rhodnius prolixus, and the cDNA of these proteins were cloned. We clarified that one of these proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 20,000 (designated as Prolixin-S) is not only an anticoagulant that inhibits an intrinsic coagulation factor (IX/IXa), but also a relaxant of vascular smooth muscle. We found that Prolixin-S binds with the smooth muscle relaxant nitric oxide NO that is synthesized in the salivary glands, and is injected into host during blood sucking, then release NO and relaxes the host blood vessel. That is, Prolixin-S reversibly binds with NO and function as a NO carrier.

N2  - During blood feeding, the protein contents of the salivary glands of Anopheles stephensi are greatly reduced. To observe the changes in salivary proteins, we analyzed the salivary glands of An. stephensi at different stages of the blood-feeding process; before probing, during probing, during feeding, and after feeding. We also investigated the midgut contents and prediuresis fluid of An. stephensi. Proteins in the salivary glands were reduced not only at the probing phase but also at the blood-feeding phase. In the midgut contents after a full blood meal, we found some proteins reacted with rabbit anti-salivary gland serum, which did not react with the midgut contents of mosquitoes before feeding. This suggests that these proteins come from the salivary glands. After feeding, we also found sporozoites in the prediuresis fluid of An. stephensi, which had been infected with Plasmodium berghei. These sporozoites may come from the salivary glands, because the density of sporozoites in the prediuresis fluid correlated with the number of sporozoites in the salivary glands. These results indicate that An. stephensi mosquitoes draw back their own saliva into their midguts when they feed blood.

N2  - Ovicidal effects of the juvenile hormone analogue, pyriproxyfen, against the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, were evaluated by laboratory test. Flea eggs aged for <2,4-6,10-12,22-24,or 46-48hrs after oviposition were exposed to pyriproxyfen on filter paper disks for 24hrs at 26℃ and 60%RH. The ovicidal effects were observed when flea eggs aged within 2hrs were exposed to pyriproxyfen, showing that the IC_<50> was 0.021μg/(cm)^2. Higher hatch inhibition tended to occur with younger aged groups of flea eggs. However, hatching of the eggs older than 46hrs was not inhibited. In the experiment on the influence of pyriproxyfen against flea eggs exposed for some fixed time duration, higher inhibition of hatching tended to occur with longer exposure times for any aged group of the flea eggs. Adult males exposed to the pyriproxyfen-treated glass surface (25,10,1μg/(cm)^2 as active ingredient) and females untreated, or vice versa, were infested on a mouse to investigate the ovicidal inhibition effect on flea eggs. The hatchability of eggs laid by females decreased with the increase of dosage. The sexual transmission of sterility by pyriproxyfen-treated males was also observed. However, the influence of pyriproxyfen wore off with time as the fleas aged after exposure.

A total of 970 black flies belonging to the following five species were captured : Simulium bidentatum, S. iwatense, S. aokii, S. nikkoense, and S. daisense. All but S. daisense sucked blood from deer. S. bidentatum, S. iwatense, and S. nikkoense had sucked blood from both cattle and deer. S. bidentatum was naturally infected with first-stage filarial larvae in the pectoral muscle. The black flies may carry pathogens between deer and cattle.

Two days after this incident, a total of six fleas were captured from the pants of the three victims. Two of the 6 fleas were brought to the laboratory and were identified as Ceratophyllus garei. Meanwhile, 4 males and 1 female C. garei were collected from the nest of a Japanese wren, Troglodytes troglodytes, on April 4,1977 on Mt. Buko of Saitama Prefecture. These data complement the collection records of C. garei in Japan.

N2  - The drop-off rhythms of engorged Ixodes nipponensis larvae and nymphs on albino mice were observed in a 14L-10D photoperiod. The engorged larvae and nymphs on mice exhibited a diurnal drop-off rhythm. The drop-off rhythm on mice was the same as that on the lizard, Takydromus tachydromoides. This suggests that the drop-off rhythms of the engorged larvae and nymphs are not affected by the physiology and daily activity of host animals.

N2  - Invasive phenomenon and incidence of the Musca species in the process of construction and development of human settlements in a tropical forest were observed with bait-traps in the dry season in Sulawesi and Seram, east Indonesia. Flies collected at 7 stations in the Toili district of Central Sulawesi numbered 2,215 comprising 3 families, viz., Muscidae, Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae. Of them, 47 individuals of 3 species, Musca domestica Linnaeus, M. ventrosa Wiedemann, and M. sorbens Wiedemann, were collected. No Musca species was caught in the uninhabited forest. M. domestica and M. ventrosa were caught in the deforestation area and at the boundary between the natural forest and a new village. M. sorbens, together with M. domestica and M. ventrosa, was caught in a new village, an old village and the Toili town. The proportion of the Musca species in total flies increased with the lapse of time after construction of human settlements. In Manusela village isolated by a tropical forest in Seram, M. sorbens occupied 98.3% of the Musca species collected, while M. domestica were very few.

N2  - With a view to clarifying the differences in distribution among chironomid species with respect to water velocity and depth in a riffle-pool unit of the river, compositions of adult males were examined which were obtained from larval samples attached to artificial substrates submerged at various points of a site of the Ohta River, Hiroshima Prefecture. As regards water velocity, Tanytarsus tamaduodecimus, Parakiefferiella oyabelurida, Microtendipes britteni, Tanytarsus tamagotoi, Cryptochironomus tamayoroi, Nanocladius quadrivittatus, Parametriocnemus stylatus, Polypedilum asakawaense, Potthastia montium and Tanytarsus arduennensis were distributed only in a range of 0-0.4m/s whereas Nilotanypus dubius, Polypedilum takaoense, Polypedilum tamahosohige and Synorthocladius tamaparvulus were distributed only in a range of 0.4-0.8m/s. On the other hand, Polypedilum hiroshimaense and Cladotanytarsus vanderwurpi were distributed in a wide range of 0-1.2m/s. As regards depth, N. dubius and P. takaoense, P. tamahosohige and S. tamaparvulus were distributed only in a range of 0-30cm whereas T. tamaduodecimus, M. britteni, T. tamagotoi, C. tamayoroi, N. quadrivittatus, P. stylatus, P. asakawaense; and P. montium and T. arduennensis were distributed only in ranges of 30-60 and 60-90cm, respectively. On the other hand, Microtendipes truncatus was distributed in a wide range of 0-90cm. These results suggest that there is a habitat-segregation with respect to water velocity and depth among the species living in a riffle-pool unit in relation to their life styles or foods.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies in Kagoshima Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and adults flying around the collectors at 73 sites in spring of 1997. A total of 15,650 blackflies, 14,114 larvae (90.2% in total number), 1,519 pupae (9.7%) and 17 adults (0.1%), were collected at 68 sites. All these blackflies were classified into 16 species of the genus Simulium Latreille. One species, Simulium (Simulium) suzukii was newly recorded from Kagoshima Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (Gnus) bidentatum (51.3% in total number), followed by S. (S.) arakawae (21.2%) and S. (S.) japonicum (10.2%). The most widely distributed species was S. (Gn.) bidentatum (54 sites), followed by S. (S.) arakawae (46 sites), S. (Nevermannia) uchidai (32 sites), S. (S.) japonicum (19 sites) and S. (S.) quinquestriatum (19 sites).

N2  - Trombiculid fauna and the seasonal occurrence of its components were surveyed at three fixed sites in an endemic area of tsutsugamushi disease (Taketa City and Asaji Town), and at four fixed sites in a non-endemic area (Oita City and Hasama Town) in Oita Prefecture, Japan. A monthly collection of unengorged larvae was made at each site from December 1996 to January 1998,from soil samples (taken from rodent nest tunnels and from the ground surface without tunnels) using the Tullgren funnel apparatus (Direct method), and/or from the ground surface with a black cloth (Suzuki method). A total of 19 species were identified, including five newly recorded species in Oita Prefecture. Leptotrombidium scutellare and L. pallidum, which had been suspected as vectors of tsutsugamushi disease in Oita Prefecture, were collected in both endemic and non-endemic areas. The former species seemed to be relatively abundant in the endemic area and very rare in the non-endemic area. By contrast, the latter species seemed to be more abundant in the non-endemic area than in the endemic area. Leptotrombidium scutellare larvae occurred from October to January, with a probable peak in November. On the other hand, L. pallidum occurred almost throughout the year with two peaks, one in September and the other between November and February. The Direct method, especially for soils of rodent nest tunnels, has been proved satisfactory in studying the fauna and seasonal occurrence of larval trombiculids, while the Suzuki method is more effective in sampling unengorged larvae of L. scutellare and Helenicula miyagawai.

N2  - Escherichia coli was isolated from the body surface, alimentary canal and excreta of the Musca domestica (Linnaeus), and the alimentary canal of Stomoxys calcitrans (Linnaeus) and Phaenicia sericata (Meigen) collected at a dairy farm in Tokushima Prefecture in 1997. We detected E. coli O157 : H7 in the excreta and other pathogenic bacteria like Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas fluorescens in the alimentary canal of M. domestica using the immunomagnetic separation method, polymerase chain reaction method and rapid identification kits. The isolated bacteria were resistant to more than three antibiotics. Escherichia coli O157 : H7 from human and E. coli O157 : H7 from M. domestica had similar susceptibility against tested antibiotics. These facts suggest that houseflies or other flies would be possible mechanical vectors to transmit the pathogens like enterohemorrhagic colitis or enteritis, although general sanitary conditions seem to be clearly improved in Japan. This is the first report of E. coli O157 : H7 in the excreta of houseflies collected at a dairy farm field.

N2  - All night mosquito collections by light traps and by a mouth aspirator for 5 minutes around animal sheds were conducted at Mae Joh University compound, northern Thailand on three nights between August and September, 1998. These were supplemented with choice/no choice experiments using nets in which mosquitoes collected from the rice field or a net with a cow or a pig were released. In the experimental nets a cow or a pig or both were tethered to evaluate precise host preference of Japanese encephalitis vectors. Light traps collected 34,708 female mosquitoes among which were 7,958 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, 22,782 Cx. vishnui and 2,083 Cx. gelidus, the main JE vectors. Only 114 females of Cx. fuscocephala, another JE vector, were captured. The proportions of fed females showed that Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui obtained more meals from the pigs than from the cows whereas Cx. gelidus fed on the cows more than the pigs in significantly different proportions. A total of 1,811 (47.2% fed) and 1,701 (38.2% fed) females of JE vectors were picked by aspirators at the cowshed and pigsty respectively. There was no difference in the proportions of fed females of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui between the cowshed and pigsty collections, and Cx. gelidus fed significantly more on the cows than the pigs. Light trap collections revealed the host range of the mosquitoes in nature, which depends on availability of blood meal sources. The choice/no-choice experiments revealed stronger preference of JE vectors for the cow to the pig. We considered this to be the precise host preference because the experiments were conducted under conditions of equal availability of hosts.

N2  - An experimental study was carried out to clarify whether or not the behavioural diapause of Haemaphysalis longicornis adults was induced by exposure to a short-day photoperiod (10L-14D) and terminated by exposure to a long-day photoperiod. The percentages of host attachment and engorgement of the adults reared at 25℃ under a 16L-8D photoperiod from egg to molting to the adult stage were very high when they were kept under the same rearing conditions for a month after molting. However, the host attachment and engorgement of the adults were significantly suppressed when they were exposed to a 10L-14D photoperiod for a month at 25℃ after molting. These results suggest that behavioural diapause occurs in the adults exposed to a short-day photoperiod after molting. This behavioural diapause appears to explain the disappearance of H. longicornis adults in autumn when the days shorten. On the other hand, the percentages of host attachment and engorgement of the adults exposed to a 10L-14D photoperiod for a month increased when they were transferred to a 16L-8D photoperiod and kept for twenty days at 25℃. This suggests that the behavioural diapause of H. longicornis adults is terminated by exposure to a long-day photoperiod. This termination of diapause appears to explain the reappearance of H. longicornis adults in spring when the days get long.

N2  - A mixture of baits containing 0.025% warfarin and 0.05% vitamin D_3 showed high toxicity to laboratory rats (Wistar strain) and black rats, Rattus rattus (probably warfarin-resistant). In laboratory rats, the acute LD_<50> value of the mixture baits was 1.42g/100g b.w. and the active ingredients ingested were warfarin 3.6mg/kg b.w. and vitamin D_3 7.1mg/kg b.w. Mean lethal days in the mixture baits decreased to about 1/124 of that of the warfarin baits when it was compared with the previous results using warfain-resistant rats (Tanikawa 1991) and mean active ingredient intake (dose of warfarin and vitamin D_3) also decreased to about 1/29. The results suggest that the mixture baits are more effective than poison baits containing only 0.025% warfarin.

Phenyl salicylate showed the lowest LC_<50> values, 9.59mg (a.i.)/m^2 for Dermatophagoides farinae, 12.2mg/m^2 for Tyrophagus putrescentiae and 6.38mg/m^2 for Blomia tropicalis. The LC_<50> values of synepirin 500,permethrin, cypermethrin and pp'-DDT were not obtained within a dosage of 4,000mg/m^2 against the 3 mite species. More than ten-fold differences in the LC_<50> values among the mite species were recognized in γ-BHC, IBTA, fenitrothion and dichlorvos. However, susceptibility of the 3 mite species in the LC_<50> values was similar in benzyl benzoate, phenyl salicylate and S421. Blomia tropicalis indicated the highest susceptibility in the LC_<50> values to 9 chemicals. Differences in concentration-response characteristics of some test chemicals were also observed.

N2  - In two areas under different environmental conditions for the breeding of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, the vector mosquito of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, the relation between the mosquito abundance and yearly data of meteorological conditions was analyzed statistically, especially in relation to the urbanization for the period 1968-1990 in Osaka Prefecture. Correlation coefficients of the deviation from regression between the mean number of mosquitoes caught during July and that caught during August, to the cummulative temperatures or total amount of precipitation during five different periods were calculated. In the barn near paddy field there were correlation between the two meteorological factors and the deviation from regression with a maximum deviation. However, recently there were little correlation between them with a minimum deviation for any barn during the years 1968-1990,as environmental conditions in the areas around the barns in which mosquitoes were collected became less appropriate for the mosquito breeding year by year. Therefore, the more the appropriateness of environmental conditions for the mosquito breeding lowers, the more the effectiveness of meteorological conditions on the level of mosquito population lowers. This may be a reason for recent fewer JE cases in spite of the favorable meteorological conditions for the breeding of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. The effect of summer temperature on the epidemic size was observed only for the period 1968-1972. No trend was discerned after that period.

N2  - Occurrence patterns in relation to some environmental factors in river environments were examined among the chironomid species of some subgenera of genus Polypedilum by a method of identifying male adults emerging from the materials attaching to blocks submerged on the bottom at rapids. In terms of altitude, Polypedilum pedestre and P. takaoense occurred only in high (≧600m) and low (<300m) altitude ranges, respectively, among the subgenus Polypedilum. Polypedilum. tamahosohige occurred in the largest number in a middle (300-600m) range. Among the subgenus Uresipedilum, P. sp. nr. pedestre occurred only in a low range. Polypedilum. hiroshimaense occurred in the largest number in a high range. In terms of topographic type, P. pedestre occurred only in an Aa (mountainous stream) type among the Polypedilum. Polypedilum tamaharaki occurred in a larger number in an Aa-Bb (intermediate type between mountainous stream and midstream). Among the Uresipedilum, P. paraviceps occurred only in Bb (midstream)/Bc (lower stream) type. P. sp. nr. pedestre and P. convictum occurred in the largest numbers in Aa and Aa-Bb types, respectively. In terms of electric conductivity, P. pedestre and P. sp. nr. tamahosohige occurred only in low (≦45μmhos/cm) and high (>90μmhos/cm) ranges, respectively, among the Polypedilum. Polypedilum tsukubaense occurred in a larger number in a middle (45-90μmhos/cm) range. Among the Uresipedilum, P. surugense occurred only in a middle range. P. hiroshimaense and P. convictum occurred in larger numbers in low and high ranges, respectively. These results suggest that there are multidimensional habitat-segregations among the species of subgenera Polypedilum and Uresipedilum.

N2  - A 12-month bimonthly outdoor inspection of domestic water receptacles for immature mosquito breeding in the Jos area of Nigeria revealed a highly significant difference (P<0.001) in mosquito abundance between the rural, semi-urban and urban centres and Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti predominated in the samples. The high mosquito abundance in Jos urban and Bukuru during December-February appeared to follow the seasonal rainfall pattern. Of all receptacles surveyed, plastic jars showed the least attraction for mosquito activity whereas clay/earthenware pots and metal cans were the favoured breeding units. The public health implications and mosquito breeding around human homes is discussed.

N2  - A monomeric hemoglobin (Hb) component (MV) of a chironomid species, Polypedilum nubeculosum (PNc), was isolated, determined for its N-terminal amino acid sequence, and the sequence was compared with that of the corresponding Hb MV of a related species, P. nubifer (PNf). In an alignment of 22 residues, only 5 positions were conserved. Replacements between hydrophobic and hydrophobic amino acids were observed at 5 positions whereas those between hydrophilic and hydrophilic amino acids were observed at 9 positions. In contrast, at only two positions, hydrophobic to hydrophilic replacements were observed. These results suggest a high speed of molecular evolution for the fifth monomeric Hb component of the genus Polypedilum.

N2  - In the midgut epithelium of Aedes albopictus (Oahu strain) orally infected with chikungunya virus, the distribution of the virus at day 3 and 14 postinfection was observed using electron microscopy. The virus cores in the cytoplasma, virus particles budding from a cytoplasmic extension to the basal labyrinth and a large number of mature virus particles in the basal labyrinth, were observed on day 3 post-infection. The virus particles were observed in the opening of the basal labyrinth and basal lamina. On day 14 post-infection, many virus particles in the basal labyrinth and massive particles in the basal lamina were observed. There were few virus particles in the basal lamina compared with many virus particles in the basal labyrinth. This observation suggests that the virus particles do not pass through a basal lamina readily; and also, that the massive virus particles observed in the basal lamina were one process for the virus to disseminate into the hemocoel side from the midgut epithelial cells.

N2  - Adults of rice-field mosquitoes were collected between May and September of 1996 and 1997 in Nishi Arita, Saga Prefecture, Japan, to determine their feeding pattern in an area where animals were available in large numbers. In total, 31,804 female Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis were collected from animal sheds using dry ice-baited light traps and mouth aspiration. Light traps in all the animal sheds captured large numbers of mosquitoes (cowsheds 7,933,pigsties 6,441 and chicken sheds 5,267 mosquitoes), although few fed upon the chickens. Overall, 62% (N=7,113) of fed Cx. triaeniorhynchus and 74% (N=7,261) of An. sinensis were caught by light traps at the cowsheds and pigsties compared to less than 5% (N=5,267) at the chickens sheds. The type of animal in the shed was the most important factor determining the feeding rates. Blood-meal identification by direct ELISA indicated that both Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and An. sinensis preferred cows and pigs to chickens. Over 90% (N=143) of the fed mosquitoes collected from one chicken shed had fed upon cows in an adjoining cowshed. The tendency to feed upon cows and pigs more than on chickens was observed both in the hillside (terraced) and lowland ricefields. This trend is shown in the results obtained by both the aspirator and light trap collection methods.

N2  - Field investigations have been carried out on Culex tritaeniorhynchus abundance and seasonality of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus activity in areas under different environmental conditions for the mosquito breeding. In large paddy-field areas with two or more piggeries at a distance from one another, a transmission cycle of JE virus was often established at an early stage in the epidemic period and every year a large population of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus appeared, increasing the density of infected mosquitoes. It seems probable that, owing to the great flight ability of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, the mosquitoes are able to find resting places, blood sources, and larval breeding places all within the usual flight range. In such circumstances, the mosquito populations may reproduce at their highest efficiency. Conversely, in large paddy-field areas with a single piggery, the mosquito populations were small, the transmission cycle of JE virus did not often occur, and the density of infected mosquitoes was low. Owing to their great flight ability, the mosquitoes tend to disperse far for ovipositing after blood-feeding. As a result, the mosquitoes may have difficulty in intercepting an odor plume after oviposition, though in large paddy-field areas with two or more piggeries, the mosquitoes will have ample opportunity to find any one of the piggeries after oviposition. The differences in environmental conditions analyzed in this study should be taken into consideration with respect to the reasons for the recent low epidemics of JE.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Akita Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and adults flying around the collectors at 118 localities in summer of 1996. A total of 15,744 blackflies, 13,876 larvae (88.1% in total number), 1,867 pupae (11.9%) and 1 adult (0.01%), were collected at 104 sites. All these blackflies were classified into sixteen species of the genus Simulium Latreille. Four species, Simulium (Nevermannia) mie, S. (Gomphostilbia) shogakii, S. (Gnus) bidentatum and S. (Simulium) kawamurae were newly recorded from Akita Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (S.) japonicum (29.4% in total number), followed by S. (S.) suzukii (25.0%), S. (N.) uchidai (18.9%), S. (O.) aokii (12.1%) and S. (Gn.) daisense (4.0%). The most widely distributed species was S. (N.) uchidai (68 sites), followed by S. (S.) suzukii (65 sites), S. (S.) japonicum (64 sites), S. (O.) aokii (42 sites), S. (N.) sp. H. (24 sites) and S. (N.) subcostatum (21 sites).

N2  - Collections of chironomid midges were conducted during a one-year period from April 1997 to March 1998 at the Kurobe Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant (Kurobe Joka Center), for obtaining basic information on their bionomics and for developing their control methods. About 20,000 adult specimens were collected during daytime with insect nets or sucking tubes, as well as during night-time with light traps, and were separated into species under a stereomicroscope, and a part of them were individually mounted on slides for species identification. A total of 42 species were collected and identified, among which 8 are described as new species in this paper, together with one new genus, Kurobebrillia. They are Cryptochironomus jokaprimus, Pentapedilum jokasecundum, Micropsectra jokatertia, M. jokaquarta, Kurobebrillia jokaquinta, Eukiefferiella jokasexta, E. jokaseptima and Limnophyes jokaoctavus.

N2  - A total of 33 species of trombiculid mites were identified in northern Kyushu, from 84,413 mites parasitic on captured host mammals at 123 sites, or collected by other methods. The vegetation types, based on the dominant plants or the physiognomies, were arranged into four groups by the trombiculid species structure, namely, the ordinary forest (Cryptomeria-Cypress forest, secondary forest, and evergreen broad-leaved forest), seaside pine forest, grassland, and montane deciduous forest. However, some differences in the structure were detected among sites in each vegetation type. A successive change in the trombiculid structure in accord with the succession of plants, beginning with pioneer species such as Gahrliepia saduski, Leptotrombidium scutellare, and L. pallidum, is discussed. The possibilities of interspecific relationships, such as competition, between two pairs of morphologically related species were suggested in the vertical distribution of L. tanaka-ryoi and L. fuji, and in the horizontal distribution of L. fukuoka and L. kitasatoi. The vector species of Tsutsugamushi disease, L. pallidum and L. scutellare, showed a somewhat restricted distribution. The small number of patients of Tsutsugamushi disease in this region, in comparison with that in southern Kyushu, was attributed to the lesser abundance of the vector trombiculid mites.

N2  - Diapausing pupae of the flesh fly, Boettcherisca peregrina (Robineau-Desvoidy) (Diptera : Sarcophagidae) were held two months at 20℃ and then chilled at 4℃ for between 0 and 48 weeks before transfer to diapause-terminating conditions (27℃). 70-89% adult emergence occurred in unchilled pupae and pupae chilled for 3-15 weeks, with the highest rate observed in those chilled for 12 weeks. Pupae chilled for 12 weeks emerged over the shortest interval (10 days) from day 14 to day 23 after being transferred to 27℃. The interval of adult emergence was longest (40 days) from day 20 to day 59 for unchilled pupae. A low percentage of adult emergence occurred in pupae chilled either 2-3 or &ge;20 weeks. All pupae that failed to emerge were dead. These results show that length of the hypothermic phase during diapause is one of the important factors determining the timing of adult eclosion in diapausing individuals of B. peregrina. The results further indicate that long hypothermic phases lower the survival rate, and this may limit the northern distribution of this species.

N2  - The seasonal activities of Ixodes monospinosus and Haemaphysalis kitaokai adults were analyzed by using the mark-recapture method at Mt. Kumakura (a hiking trail about 1km long) in the Chichibu Mountains of Saitama Prefecture. A total of 148 I. monospinosus and 1,013 H. kitaokai adults were marked and released in spring (April to June, 1997 and April to May, 1998) and in autumn (September to November, 1997 and October to November, 1998). None of the I. monospinosus and H. kitaokai adults captured in spring were recaptured in autumn. However, a part of the adults of both species captured in autumn were recaptured the next spring. These results suggest that in both I. monospinosus and H. kitaokai, the adults which appeared during spring and autumn are of different generations. The adults of both species appear to begin their activity in autumn and to complete it in the next spring or summer.

N2  - A preliminary survey targeting flies associated with wild chimpanzees was carried out at the Mahale Mountains National Park, Western Tanzania, during the November-December rainy season of 1995 and 1996. A total of 16 genera and 35 species belonging to 5 families (Tabanidae, Glossinidae, Muscidae, Sarcophagidae and Calliphoridae) were collected. Of these, 5 genera and 10 species of 3 families, namely Haematopota nigripennis, H. unicolor, H. theobaldi, Haematobosca wooffi, Stomoxys transvittatus, S. pallidus, S. omega, Sarcophaga (Xanthopterisca) elegantipes, Neomyia limbata and N. difficilis were new records for Tanzania. The fly fauna was characteristic of central Africa, rather than East Africa. Two tsetse fly species, namely, Glossina morsitans morsitans and G. longipennis, were collected in the vicinity of chimpanzee populations. Although G. longipennis rarely feeds on primates, many blood meals from this species were experimentally confirmed to be of primates origin. Sarcophaga (Bercaea) aruno was the main species attracted to chimpanzee excrements.

N2  - As one of the measures to prevent diseases which might be caused by imported mosquitoes, we conducted a survey on mosquitoes and their breeding sources from April to December, 1998,at Kansai International Airport constructed in 1994 on an artificial island in Osaka Bay, about 5km off the coast of Izumi-Sano City. Nine indigenous species belonging to 3 genera were found, but there were no imported species. The species collected were as follows; Anopheles (Anopheles) sinensis, Culex (Culex) pipiens pallens, Cx. (Cux.) tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. (Cux.) orientalis, Cx. (Barraudius) inatomii, Cx. (Lutzia) halifaxii, Cx. (Culiciomyia) sasai, Aedes (Finlaya) togoi and Ae. (Stegomyia) albopictus. Anopheles sinensis and Cx. inatomii, which was newly recorded outside of the type locality, Okayama, were mainly collected in one water pool made of concrete and temporary ground pools, respectively. Culex p. pallens was very common in water pools made of concrete.

Dust samples were collected from the floors, "goza" (Japanese matting), "futon" (Japanese mattresses) and blankets in five rooms for 3-year-old children at day nurseries in Ginowan City and Nishihara Town, Okinawa Prefecture, in February and July 1997. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was dominant in the day nurseries. The number of dust mites was 3,740 (n=17) in February and 2,204 (n=19) in July. Fifteen out of 36 samples contained more than 100 mites per 1m^2. Many mites were found in the "goza", constituting 50.2% of the total collected in February and 68.9% in July.

N2  - Information on zoonotic Onchocerca species and their insect vectors in Japan is reviewed. At least six Onchocerca species are known in four kinds of ungulates : O. cervicalis in horse (Equus caballus); O. gibsoni, O. gutturosa, O. lienalis and O. sp. (probably same as O. suzukii) in cattle (Bos taurus); O. skrjabini and O. suzukii in Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus); and O. sp. (probably same as, or near to, O. skrjabini) in Japanese deer (Cervus nippon). Five blackfly species serve as natural vectors of three bovine Onchocerca species : Simulium bidentatum for O. gutturosa; S. arakawae, S. daisense and S. kyushuense for O. lienalis; and S. aokii, S. arakawae, S. bidentatum and S. daisense for O. sp. Little is known on the transmission of the other Onchocerca species. Two human cases of zoonotic onchocerciasis found in Japan are also reviewed. O. gutturosa is considered the causative species in both cases, with the possibility of O. sp. (parasite of deer) being involved in the second case.

N2  - The fauna and the geographical distribution of vectors of Chagas' disease were investigated based on the man-hour collection, from mud walls or palm-thatched houses in 236 villages, from the year 1995 through 1997,throughout Guatemala. A total of 1,131 vectors comprising 731 (64.6%) of Triatoma dimidiata, 53 (4.7%) of T. nitida and 347 (30.7%) of Rhodnius prolixus were found. T. dimidiata was collected in 16 out of 22 departments, whereas R. prolixus was collected in five departments, and T. nitida was collected only in three departments. The total number of R. prolixus was not small. 85% of the bugs was collected from 800m to 1,400m above sea level in the present study areas. We collected more bugs in the east and the southeast departments of the country, such as in the borders with Honduras and El Salvador. The rate of positive houses with bugs is the highest in Jutiapa, followed by Alta Verapaz, Chiquimula, Santa Rosa, and Quiche. The bug density in the investigated houses is the highest in Chiquimula, while the geographical dispersion of bugs is the widest in Jutiapa. The natural infection of bugs with Trypanosoma cruzi is the highest in Zacapa. Based on the above-mentioned positive rate of bugs and from the data of the 1994 National Census in Guatemala, we concluded that the departments with high risk to Chagas' disease are Jutiapa, Alta Verapaz, Chiquimula, Quiche and Santa Rosa, followed by Zacapa, Jalapa, Baja Verapaz, El Progreso and Escuintla. We have estimated that approximately 330,000 people live in the areas at high risk to the infection of Chagas' disease in Guatemala.

N2  - Entomological surveillance of Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille), the principal vector of Chagas' disease in Guatemala was performed in 186 rural houses in Santa Maria Ixhuatan, Department of Santa Rosa, Guatemala from 1995 through 1996. 73.1% of bajareque houses (plastered walls with mud and grass fiber on bamboo grills) keeps the vector, followed by adobe (sun-dried mud bricks) with 39.1%, stones (34.6%), and block (8.6%), in total 41.9% of the houses in this village keeps vectors. House composition selected in random sampling for this study are bajareque (32.8%), block (30.3%), stone (13.5%), adobe (13.9%) and others (9.5%). When bajareque walls are plastered with lime or stucco, the vector infestation is dramatically reduced. This suggests that non-plastered bajareque house is the most favored house to the vectors in this locality. The number of vector's excrements on the walls reflects the number of bugs, as well as the number of domestic animals in a house. The vectors prefer dark corners close to beds. The natural infestion ratio of Trypanosoma cruzi was 29.3% in total, but negative for the first-stage nymph.

N2  - Effect of a potent trehalase inhibitor, validoxylamine A (VAA), on the oocyte development and ootheca formation was observed in two species of cockroaches, Blattella germanica, and Periplaneta fuliginosa. By injection with VAA to female adults of B. germanica, lethal activity was observed and the oocyte development delayed, but the ootheca was formed with hatchable oocytes in most of the surviving females. In P. fuliginosa, VAA injection suppressed oocyte development and normal ootheca formation. Oothecae deposited by VAA-injected females were dented and no nymph hatched from the oothecae as in P. americana reported previously. These effects on the reproduction seem to be caused by the inhibitory action of VAA to the trehalase, because the trehalase activity in the ovary and accessary gland was actually inhibited by the administration of VAA in both species. The inhibition of trehalase was lower in the ovary of B. germanica than in that of P. fuliginosa whose ootheca formation was affected more strongly by the administration of VAA.

N2  - Changes in salivary gland proteins during feeding in the blood sucking insect, Rhodnius prolixus, and antibodies against the salivary gland components induced in host rabbits bitten repeatedly by the bugs were investigated. Proteins secreted into host animals during feeding were 43% of total salivary gland proteins in 5th-instar nymphs (128 to 73μg/pair of glands), and 33% in adults (206 to 139μg/pair of glands). Some salivary gland components, 23.5,28.3,34 and 39kDa proteins were greatly reduced to 21,13,22 and 17% of original contents in 5th-instar nymphs, and 62,37,67 and 45% in adults, respectively. Total and antigen-specific antibodies induced in rabbits bitten repeatedly by nymph and adult bugs were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western-blotting. The titers of total antibodies increased with repeated bites, being higher in the second and third bites than the primary. Most of protein components in the salivary glands were immunogenic, but some components, particularly 39kDa protein showed strong antigenicities in the host animals. Some components, for example 28.3kDa protein, however, did not show any antigenicity and some functionally important proteins (RpSG-I, II and III) showed relatively low antigenicities, even those proteins are injected much amount during feeding. It is concluded that the antibody induction is not depending only on the amount of antigen injected during feeding, but on the properties of individual components.

N2  - The testis and the vesiculae seminales (VS) of males of P. americana were resected within three days after emergence, and the males were mated with females. The lifespan of the testis or VS resected males was close to the normal on the average. The females mating with the males whose testis was resected produced an average of 41 oothecae per female and about 90% was the normally formed ootheca, similar to the female mating with the normal male. The females mating with the males whose VS was resected produced an average of 11 oothecae per female and the ratio of malformed ootheca was over 80% like the unmated female. The ratio of hatching of oothecae produced by the females mating with the testis or VS-resected males was only 3.4% and 2.7%, and the progeny was only female. The results suggest that the male whose testis was resected still retained the ability to copulate and ejaculate without spermotozoon in the semen, and the VS-resected male lost its ability to copulate or ejaculate. It also suggests that ovum development and ovulation are promoted by stimulation of sexual intercouse or secretion of VS entering the female reproductive organ during copulation.

N2  - The host-feeding activity of Haemaphysalis flava females that were reared at a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D) from the nymphal stage was observed on the ears of domestic rabbits. The host-feeding activity (host attachment and engorgement) of the females was suppressed even when they attached to hosts five months after they had molted (September or October, 1998). This may suggest that the females exposed to a long-day photoperiod enter behavioural diapause immediately after they have molted and postpone host-feeding activity for a long period of time. This suppression of host-feeding activity may affect the time required to complete the life cycle of H. flava and explain at least in part why larval activity is limited during the period summer to autumn.

N2  - Infection rates and mean titers of the infected mosquitoes were compared in the strains of Aedes albopictus from Shanghai and Changdu, and Ae. aegypti from Dianbai and Haikaou on the 14th day after feeding on a blood-virus mixture. The infection rate of the Shanghai strain of Ae. albopictus was 86.7%; it showed the highest rate among 4 strains. The infection rate of the Changdu strain was 50%. On the other hand the infection rates of the Dianbai and the Haikaou strains of Ae. aegypti were 18.8% and 9.1%, respectively. The mean virus titer of infected individuals of the Shanghai strain was (10)^<4.2> PFU and that of the Changdu strain was (10)^<3.3> PFU. The mean virus titer of the Dianbai strain showed (10)^<3.9> PFU. Though the infection rates of the two strains of Ae. aegypti were lower than the rates of the two stains of Ae. albopicus, virus titers of infected individuals were high comparatively. These data indicated the Shanghai strain of Ae. albopictus had the ability to transmit the chikungunya virus.

N2  - Occurrences in relation to the eutrophication level were investigated of chironomid species of the genus Tanytarsus by the method of identifying male adults emerging from the materials attaching to concrete plates submerged on the bottom at littorals of some lakes at different eutrophication levels in Japan. As a result, the occurrence patterns of nine species were clarified. Among these, T. tamagotoi occurred in the largest number in waters at a low eutrophication level whereas T. takahashii occurred in the largest number at a middle eutrophication level, although they occurred at all levels. On the other hand, T. unagiseptimus and T. oyamai occurred in the largest numbers at a high level. These results suggest that species compositions of this genus in littoral communities can be applied to biological judgement of the eutrophication levels of lakes.

Life and death of spiderlings and adults were observed in temperatures varied from 4 to -10.5℃. Among them, the male adults showed the best tolerance, with 50% survival during 30min. at around -10℃, followed by the second-instar spiderlings 30% of which were able to survive 25min. at the same temperature. This indicates the possibility of further expansion and habitation of the redback spider in colder climates in Japan.

N2  - This review deals with defensive and aggressive behaviors of social wasps against mammalian and insect nest intruders, and describes (1) major features of the life history, (2) predators and parasitoids attacking the colony, (3) mechanisms of defensive behavior against colony predators, (4) factors affecting the degree of defensive and aggressive behaviors, and (5) wasp stings in Japan. The degree of guard, warning, threat and attack exhibited by workers is dependent upon a number of conditions, including (1) species differences (2) colony size, (3) state of colony growth, (4) colony history, (5) hornet predation, (6) queenright or orphaned colony, (7) day or night, and (8) geographical distribution, and all of these conditions are usually interrelated. The relative aggressiveness estimated by these measurable factors in various vespid wasps is ordered approximately as follows : Polistinae; Polistes rothneyi > P. snelleni ≧ Parapolybia varia ≧ Pp. indica > P. chinensis ≧ P. jadwigae ≧ Ropalidia fasciata ≧ R. marginata ≧ P. nipponensis ≧ P. riparius > P. japonicus. Vespinae; Vespa mandarinia ≧ V. simillima ≧ V. dybowskii ≧ V. crabro > V. affinis ≧ Vespula shidai > Vl. flaviceps ≧ Vl. vulgaris ≧ Dolichovespula media ≧ D. pacifica ≧ D. saxonica > Vl. rufa > V. analis > V. ducalis, though no accurate technique has been developed to measure the intensity of defensive activity of social wasps in each colony.

N2  - In August 1942 dengue fever broke out in Nagasaki, a port city located in the Kyushu District, Japan. It soon spread over other cities, recurring every summer until 1944. This was not only the first dengue epidemic in Japan proper but also was one of the most widespread dengue epidemics recorded in a temperate region, involving at least 200,000 typical cases. It was obvious that the principal vector was Aedes albopictus which distributes in the Main Islands of Japan, particularly south of 38-39°N. At that time an important factor promoted transmission of the infection. A number of water tanks had been set up for the purpose of extinguishing fires caused by bombardment during the war, and the tanks were occupied by innumerable mosquitoes. Large-scale application of insecticides was not then possible. Since the early work by Yamada (1917a, b), it had been believed that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes do not habit in Japan proper, excepting the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands. Contrarily, Oguri (1945) and Oguri and Kobayashi (1947,1948) reported that they found Ae. aegypti in the Ushibuka area of Kyushu (32°N) during September 1944 to May 1947. Several other investigators obtained similar survey data as those of Oguri and Kobayashi (1947,1948). The species, either adults or larvae, completely disappeared, however, from there after 1955. In another survey it was observed that, inside a cargo boat which plied between Japan and dengue-prevalent Southeast Asian countries, many Ae. aegypti were seen flying and also larvae were caught from small water deposits on the decks. It was thought that Ae. aegypti were transferred into Japan probably by boat, and that the mosquito settled in a particular area of Japan for several years. There was no definite evidence as to whether or not the imported Ae. aegypti had some role in the 1942-1944 Japanese dengue epidemics. However, serious precautions must be taken against the possible danger that vectors of infectious diseases may be introduced into an originally non-endemic area. Biological and epidemiological aspects relative to these problems are discussed.

N2  - The drop-off rhythms of engorged Ixodes persulcatus larvae and nymphs were observed in a 14L-10D photoperiod, in constant darkness and light from the 3rd day after infestation, and in constant darkness and light after infestation. The engorged larvae and nymphs exhibited a diurnal drop-off rhythm in a 14L-10D photoperiod. This rhythm was maintained in constant darkness and light from the 3rd day after infestation, and in constant darkness after infestation. Therefore, the detachment of engorged larvae and nymphs appears to be controlled by an endogenous circadian mechanism of regulation which is entrained by the photoperiod. The drop-off of the engorged larvae, however, showed an unclear rhythm in constant light after infestation. This suggests that the diurnal drop-off rhythm is strongly disturbed in constant light after infestation. In both engorged larvae and nymphs, the dropping time was delayed in constant darkness from the 3rd day after infestation and in constant darkness after infestation. This may be due to the lack of the stimulus of light in constant darkness.

N2  - The effect of various environmental conditions on the dispersion of some astigmatid mites was studied. An increase of the alarm pheromone, citral, in the medium stimulated the active dispersion of Carpoglyphus lactis, Lardoglyphus konoi, Tyrophagus putrescentiae and Aleuroglyphus ovatus. All the mites examined in this experiment (C. lactis, L. konoi, T. putrescentiae, A. ovatus and Dermatophagoides farinae) were dispersed more actively at low humidity than at high humidity. With regard to the effect of temperatures on the dispersion, the mites were classified into two types. The mites in the first type, which consisted of L. konoi, Glycyphagus domesticus and Acarus immobilis, were more actively dispersed at a high temperature (35℃). The mites in the other type, which consisted of C. lactis and T. putrescentiae, became active at low temperatures (15℃ or 20℃). The citral, secreted out of C. lactis bodies at 15℃ or 35℃, had a higher ratio of neral than geranial. The quantity of citral in the medium with C. lactis mites was higher at 15℃ than at 35℃. The difference of in the citral content in the medium with the mites was correlative to the dispersion activity of C. lactis. It was suggested that aggravation of the environmental factors for C. lactis stimulated the secretion of the alarm pheromone, citral, and this phenomenon activated the dispersion of the mites.

N2  - We found a close relation between the number of Triatoma dimidiata collected by the man-hour method and the number of excrement spots of the vector on white paper placed on the wall for a week or more. The sticky trap, hiding box or animal trap was not effective for detecting T. dimidiata because of their dull and slow behavior. The flushing-out method is not effective either in estimating the density in the case of T. dimidiata, because T. dimidiata were not easily flushed-out from their hiding-places by spraying pyrethroid insecticides. We recommend use of the manhour collection or the white paper method for assessing the density of T. dimidiata in Guatemala.

N2  - From June, 1993 to August, 1994,the mite fauna and abundance in dust from bedding and bedrooms were investigated in 20 houses of non-allergic dwellers in Okinawa, Japan. The dust samples were collected from an area of 1m^2 of bedding and floors by using a vacuum cleaner for 1 minute. A lot of mites (geometric mean, GM, 3,076,arithmetic mean, AM, 6,159) was collected from dust samples of a spring bed mattress in the bedroom. Among 8 spring bed mattresses examined, 37.5% had more than 5,001 mites and none harbored less than 1,000 mites. It was also evident that the number of mites from "shiki-futon" increased with the use of a spring bed mattress. A lot of mites (GM, 4,775,AM, 8,069) was also collected on the carpeted floor of bedrooms. In carpeted floors, 37.5% had more than 5,001 mites and none had less than 1,000 mites. The most dominant species was Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (75-99%) in bedding and (75-96%) floor dust of bedrooms, followed by Blomia tropicalis (0.4-11,0.9-5.8%) and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (0.03-4.2,0.1-9.8%). A small number of D. farinae was also collected.

N2  - Synthesis of trehalose in cultured tissues and organs of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, and effect of a trehalase inhibitor, validoxylamine A (VAA), on it were studied using a medium containing ^<13>C-labelled precursors, [^<13>C-1] glucose or [^<13>C-1] fructose by ^<13>C-NMR spectroscopy. Trehalose was produced only by the fat body among the tested tissues and organs. The abdominal fat body utilized glucose and fructose as an energy source as well as a material for trehalose synthesis in vitro. VAA enhanced the trehalose synthesis both in vivo and in vitro, even when the fat body used for the culture was obtained from a cockroach previously injected with VAA. The fat body from the female cockroach had the capacity to produce about 212 nmol of trehalose/hr/insect in a medium with 14mM [^<13>C-1] glucose and 10^<-6>M VAA. When fructose was used as a precursor, the fat body produced glucose as well as trehalose, but trehalose only in the presence of VAA. Feedback control of trehalose synthesis by trehalose was observed in the cultured fat body with fructose as a precursor. These results indicated that the fat body hydrolyzed trehalose along with the trehalose synthesis, and that VAA had no effect on the trehalose synthesis itself. ^<13>C-NMR with the tissue culture system containing [^<13>C-1] precursor and VAA was proved to give satisfactory results for estimating the synthetic activity of trehalose and sugar metabolism in the insect fat body.

N2  - Established populations of Aedes albopictus (Sukuse) in Guatemala were first discovered in the Caribbean harbor towns of Puerto Barrios and Puerto de Santo Tomas de Castilla, Department of Izabal, in 1995. We investigated the geographic distribution and seasonal prevalence of this species in Guatemala in 1997. We collected larvae or pupae from artificial water containers in or around houses by random sampling in the dry and rainy seasons (March and August). The distribution of this species is limited to the same area where it was first discovered in 1995. This is very different from the situation in the United States where this species has consistently expanded its distribution. Aedes albopictus in Guatemala prefers to breed in small water containers in urban sites, and its density is higher than that of Ae. aegypti in the rainy season in the limited localities. We could not find Ae. albopictus in villages located along the border with Mexico, Honduras or El Salvador, at harbor towns on the coast of the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic Highway to the City of Guatemala.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Yamanashi Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams at 47 sites in summer of 1997. A total of 8,512 blackflies, consisting of 7,802 larvae (91.7% in total number) and 710 pupae (8.3%), were collected at 41 sites. All of these blackflies were classified into 14 species of the two genera, Simulium Latreille and Prosimulium Roubaud. Two species, Simulium (Simulium) nikkoense and S. (Eusimulium) sp. H were newly recorded from Yamanashi Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (S.) japonicum (51.5% in total number), followed by S. (Gnus) bidentatum (18.8%), S. (Odagmia) aokii (10.5%), S. (S.) suzukii (5.0%), S. (Nevermannia) uchidai (4.7%), S. (Gomphostilbia) shogakii (4.6%) and S. (O.) iwatense (3.2%). The most widely distributed species was S. (S.) japonicum (36 sites), followed by S. (N.) uchidai (19 sites), S. (Gn.) bidentatum (16 sites) and S. (S.) suzukii (16 sites).

N2  - In 1995 red-back spiders, Latrodectus hasseltii were first collected in Osaka Prefecture and detailed field survey showed that two other species of widow spiders, L. geometricus and Latrodectus sp., also distributed in several areas of Japan. The bite of Latrodectus. sp. was reported to cause severe latrodectism to a man in Yeyama Islands ca 40 years ago. The antivenom produced with the venom extract of red-back spiders in Australia was stocked at Tokyo, Mie, Osaka and Okinawa Prefectures for accidental bites of widow spiders. Meanwhile, it was not known whether IgG antibodies in the antivenom can bind to the venom proteins of L. geometricus and Latrodectus sp. Thus, venom proteins from three species of widow spiders were separated and immunoblot analysis was carried out to know the binding specificity of the antivenom. Horse IgG antibodies strongly bound to the bands corresponding to α-latrotoxin in the venom gland extract of red-back spiders and moderately in the bands of brown widow spiders. The protein pattern of the venom gland extract in Latrodectus sp. is slightly different from the pattern of the two other species. The binding of the antivenom to the protein bands of Latrodectus sp. seemed to be similar to that of red-back spiders. Based on the obtained results, it is possible that the antivenom can be used for persons who are bitten accidentally by Latrodectus sp. or brown widow spiders.

N2  - The incidence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Japan has decreased in recent years as a secondary consequence of modernization of the agricultural system in this country. The population of the vector mosquito, Culex tritaeniorhynchus has decreased in ricefields where new methods for rice cultivation have been applied. Nowadays, ricefields have small amounts of water due to technology which controls the management of intermittent water supply, new varieties of rice have been developed to shorten the period of cultivation, and pesticides are extensively used. These facts have transformed the ricefields into inadequate places for mosquito breeding. The following reasons also contribute to the drastic reduction of the vector mosquito with consequent decrease in incidence of JE : very few teams of animals are raised in the farms, the large-scale pigsties are located far from human habitation, and modern construction methods of houses and pigsties hamper the entrance and feeding of mosquitoes. Recently, projects for development of ricefields and pig breeding are promoted in Southeast Asia with the purpose of increasing food production. Such promotion is giving rise to spread of JE in Southeast Asia and this is, therefore, imported to Japan. Moreover, the global warming, the changes in environment and emergence of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes increase the risk of epidemic in Japan and other Asian countries at any time. Therefore, the development of additional methods for vector control and strengthening of the alert attitude by health professionals and scientists are needed.

N2  - This study shows the effectiveness of house modification for the control of Chagas' disease vectors in natural and artificial conditions. Wall plastering and paint were evaluated for the control of population of Chagas' vector by assessing vector numbers in man-hour collection before and after modifications in 1993. We evaluated 29 houses, from three small villages in Villa Canales, located in the Department of Guatemala; eighteen of them had some kind of modification or improvement. In the houses covered with plastered of cement and lime, we found a 92% reduction of the total vector population in the following year. Other houses with partial modification and paint with lime showed a reduction of 53% and 35%, respectively. In houses without improvements, the number of vectors remained the same. We collected Triatoma dimidiata Latreille (1911), and T. nitida Usinger (1939) in the houses; the infection rate with Trypanosoma cruzi was 21% and 50%, respectively. After the house modifications no significant changes occurred in the parasitic ratio. There was no statistical difference in longevity of T. dimidiata when kept in artificial conditions (simulation of wall plasters) compared to research in the fields.

N2  - The number of Triatoma dimidiata found per man-hour of collection in each of the three mud-walled houses were 4,1 and 37. In the third house 8 of T. nitida were also collected. When the walls of these houses were dismantled, an additional 114,141 and 307 of T. dimidiata were collected along with 34 of T. nitida in the third house. In the palm-thatch roofed huts only Rhodnius prolixus were collected. The numbers per man-hour collected were 11,27 and 26. When the roofs were dismantled and searched 75,449 and 978 bugs were found in the respective houses. These results indicate that the numbers collected by the traditional method did not accurately reflect the population density in the houses. The collections indicate that the hiding places of T. dimidiata and R. prolixus were very limited within the houses. An average of 31% of T. dimidiata were collected in only two dismantled block sections (2m^2) which were close to the beds and chicken nest and 40% of R. prolixus in the last house were obtained in the lower section of the palm-thatched roofs just above a bed. This area occupied only 4.2% area in total space of the house. These results suggest that insecticidal treatments would be most effective if they focused on the places where more bugs concentrate.

N2  - When a harbourage shelter occupied by marked cockroaches was placed in one of two compartments divided by a partition with a small hole through which the cockroaches could come in and go out in a test container, and another new and vacant shelter was placed in the other, the movement frequency of male adults from one compartment to the other was much higher than that of female adults. The movement frequency of male adults increased with the increase of population density more sensitively than that of female adults. When female adults were released into a test container where only one shelter fully occupied by male adults had been placed, most of the male adults in the shelter were replaced by the female adults within 10 minutes. Female adults having fully occupied a shelter, however, were not replaced by introduced male adults. These results indicate that female adults prevail over male adults in their interaction for a suitable harbourage space, while male adults tend to seek new space more actively than female adults.

N2  - More than 2 thousand field-collected specimens were morphologically examined to clarify the taxonomic status of Anopheles saperoi saperoi and An. saperoi ohamai. No specific or subspecific difference was detected between the two subspecies in the larval and pupal chaetotaxy. Anopheles s. saperoi reared under low temperature and short day-length (15℃, 10h) in the larval stage had longer wings, longer subcostal pale spots and shorter apical pale spots than the ones reared under high temperature and long day-length conditions (25℃, 15h). These variations also were confirmed in both subspecies obtained in the fields at various seasons. We consider that the differences in the subcostal and apical pale spots between these two subspecies are due to seasonal variation occurring in both subspecies. Thus, An. ohamai is degraded to a mere synonym of An. saperoi.

All of the raccoon dogs examined were infected with a great number of Sarcoptes scabiei, but not with Demodex. Histopathological examinations of the autopsy specimen demonstrated prominent hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and papillomatosis and numerous cross-sections of S. scabiei in the horny layer. S. scabiei were considered to be the cause of the dermatitis of these wild raccoon dogs.

The LC_<50> values of organophosphates (malathion, fenitrothion, dichlorvos and temefos) examined were low for An. minimus. Against p, p'-DDT, 6 organophosphates and permethrin tested, An. saperoi showed low LC_<50> values. For An. sinensis, the LC_<50> values to 5 of 7 organophosphates were high, being 19.2ppm to malathion, 15.5ppm to fenitrothion, 9.7ppm to dichlorvos, 8.3ppm to diazinon and 73.0ppm to trichlorfon, respectively. Furthermore, the values were high to p, p'-DDT and permethrin.

N2  - The effects of photoperiods on host-feeding and development in Haemaphysalis flava nymphs were observed at 25℃ under four different photoperiods (10L-14D, 12L-12D, 14L-10D, and 16L-8D). The rate of engorgement was significantly reduced by exposure to 10L-14D or 12L-12D photoperiods from the egg to the unfed nymphal stages. The development of the engorged nymphs was also retarded or arrested by exposure to 10L-14D or 12L-12D photoperiods. These results suggest that diapause occurs in the unfed and engorged nymphs that have been exposed to short-day or 12L-12D photoperiods from the egg stage. However, the rate of engorgement of the nymphs was relatively high when they were reared under a short-day photoperiod of 10L-14D. In addition, evidence of commencement of apolysis (the developmental change in the cuticle) was found in the engorged nymphs at a 10L-14D photoperiod. Thus, the diapause of the nymphs appears to be light. Although the diapause of H. flava nymphs is light, most of those that are molted from the engorged larvae in autumn may not develop to adults within the same year.

N2  - The fertility of mosquitoes largely depends on a blood meal taken from host animals or humans. After feeding, the blood proteins are digested in the midgut to amino acids, which are then transferred into the hemolymph. Although absorbed amino acids are utilized as precursors for vitellogenin synthesis, these nutrients have other important effects upon mosquito oogenesis. First, the increase of amino acid concentration in the hemolymph after a blood meal may initiate and promote follicular development. For this activity, it is essential that amino acids increase in a balanced composition; lack of any one of the nutritionally-essential amino acids fails to initiate the development of follicles. Second, the number of follicles which are able to mature depends largely on the amount of available amino acids in terms of either concentration in the hemolymph or length of supply from the midgut. During a number of evolutionary steps, mosquitoes seem to have acquired a system to monitor available amino acids for efficient oogenesis.

N2  - The insecticidal efficacy against Triatoma dimidiata and Rhodnius prolixus, the main vectors of Chagas' disease in Guatemala, was evaluated in six Guatemalan villages. A 0.075% lambda-cyhalothrine suspension was the most effective to both species when sprayed at 40ml/m^2 on the mud walls or 80ml/m^2 to straw thatched houses, followed by a 0.2% liquid or 1% powder of deltamethrin, 0.5% propoxur liquid or 0.5% diazinon suspension, spraying at 100ml/m^2,during 2 to 4 months following the treatment, as assessed by man-hour collection or a count of the spots of vector excrements on white papers placed on the walls. However, diazinon powder and fenitrothion suspension were less effective than the other insecticides for vector control. Deltamethrin powder and liquid caused ocular and nasal irritation to the sprayers and residents immediately after treatment and lambda-cyhalothrine caused less irritation. The permethrin smoking agent was not effective to Rh. prolixus bacause smoke could not stay in the houses. We recommend the use of lambdacyhalothrine suspension in the Guatemalan mud and straw thatched houses.

N2  - We studied the relationship between environmental conditions of open drains and the density of Culex quinquefasciatus Say immatures in Ujung Pandang, the biggest city in Sulawesi Island. Fifty sites in the 6 drains varied in environmental conditions such as the water flow, surface-water coverage, waste water input and the presence or absence of the larvivorous fish, guppy (Poecilia reticulata Peters). The immatures of Cx. quinquefasciatus were absent in all of the sites where the surface water flowed well. Among sites with stagnant surface water, the density of the immatures was high in the sites that received waste water. The mosquito immatures were absent in the sites without waste water input where the guppy was present. Although the predation pressure of the guppy might partially prevent Cx. quinquefasciatus breeding in less polluted water, its role in controlling the entire Cx. quinquefasciatus population in Ujung Pandang was considered to be small, because the guppy was absent in the most of sites with polluted water and the majority of drains in the city received waste water from houses. Improvement of the water flow and reduction of the waste water input are considered as the effective control methods of Cx. quinquefasciatus population.

N2  - Pinholes of several sizes were exposed to Indian meal moths, and larval invasion through the pinholes was examined under the laboratory cage conditions. Hatching larvae could not penetrate 0.020mm-thick polyethylene film with no pinholes. Pinholes of 0.398mm or 0.450mm diameter resulted in as many larvae found in the food container as those of 0.495mm diameter. Fewer larvae (less than 1/10 of those through pinholes of 0.495mm diameter) invaded food containers through pinholes of 0.293mm diameter, and no larvae invaded through 0.173mm pinholes. Even a single pinhole of 0.495mm diameter could attract half as many larvae as a container opening of 29.2mm diameter, demonstrating the importance of a single pinhole. No eggs were deposited through the pinholes even of 0.495mm diameter, the largest size tested.

N2  - Frequencies of blood meals and survival rates of vector mosquitoes are important parameters influencing transmission efficiency of pathogens. We applied the time series analysis proposed by Holmes and Birley (1987) for estimation of gonotrophic cycle lengths and survival rates of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. gelidus, Japanese encephalitis (JE) vectors in Thailand. Females of these species were collected at a buffalo shed and a pigsty in a suburban area near Bangkok during 30 and 24 consecutive nights, respectively. Specimens were dissected daily to determine the parity status by tracheation of ovaries. In total, 17,482 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and 13,011 Cx. gelidus females were caught, including 15 and 19% of parous individuals, respectively. The time series analysis for the data set collected at the buffalo shed yielded a gonotrophic cycle length of 5 days and a survival rate per cycle of 20% for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and 8 days and 16% for Cx. gelidus. From these estimates, daily survival rates were calculated as 72% and 80% for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. gelidus, respectively. However, the data set collected at the pigsty did not yield significant results. Holmes and Birley's (1987) method could be an effective tool in epidemiological studies for Japanese encephalitis vectors, but its applicability is influenced by conditions at collection sites.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Miyazaki Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and adults flying around the collectors, at 82 localities in spring of 1995. A total of 16,088 blackflies, 14,210 larvae (88.3% in total number), 1,855 pupae (11.5%) and 23 adults (0.1%), were collected at 80 sites. All these blackflies were classified into fifteen species of the genus Simulium Latreille and Prosimulium Roubaud. Two species, Prosimulium (Prosimulium) yezoense and Simulium (Nevermannia) subcostatum s. l. were newly recorded from Miyazaki Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (Gnus) bidentatum (47.3% in total number), followed by S. (S.) japonicum (12.8%), S. (S.) arakawae (10.7%), S. (Nevermannia) uchidai (7.0%) and S. (Odagmia) aokii (6.6%). The most widely distributed species was S. (Gn.) bidentatum (58 sites), followed by S. (N.) uchidai (42 sites), S. (S.) rufibasis (36 sites), S. (S.) japonicum (35 sites), S. (S.) arakawae (30 sites) and S. (O.) aokii (29 sites).

N2  - This paper reviews significant literature on human cases of infestation with hard tick, Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899 occurred in Japan during the period 1952 to 1997. The relevant literature revealed that a total of 216 patients (90 male, 114 female and 12,sex unknown) had been reported upto August 1997. Furthermore, 12 more unexplained cases were found in the literature. The pertinent data on each patient of the 216 cases were briefly summarized in the Tables. The infested patients are distributed widely in Japan, but the highest incidence of cases was found in Nagano Prefecture in Central Japan. The age range of the patients was 1 to 88 years, and the highest incidence was found in younger children under the age of nine. The tick infestation of the reported cases most frequently occurred in the summer period of May to August, and the highest incidence was found in June. The most common infestation site of the patients was on the skin of the head region, particularly around the eyes (upper and lower eyelids). The tick bites in the majority of the cases were principally acquired in the mountainous areas.

N2  - Three domestic cockroach species, the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana; the Smoky brown cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa; and the German cockroach, Blattella germanica were used in this experiment to determine the effect of mating on oviposition and possibility of parthenogenesis. In comparison with mated females, unmated females of P. americana and P. fuliginosa had a longer adult lifespan, but produced obviously fewer oothecae, including many malformed oothecae. The malformed ootheca rate was higher than 60%. However, unmated females of B. germanica were similar to mated females in adult lifespan and the oviposition cycle, and all the oothecae produced by unmated females were normally formed. Parthenogenesis was found in P. americana and P. fuliginosa. The hatchability of oothecae produced by unmated females, which the malformed oothecae were not counted, was 18.7% in P. americana, and 16.7% in P. fuliginosa. All the parthenogenetic progeny were females. Parthenogenesis was not found in B. germanica, oothecae deposited by unmated females were desiccated and fell of before new oothecae were produced.

N2  - With a view to clarifying intrageneric habitat segregations with respect to various environmental factors among species of four genera, Cricotopus, Polypedilum, Rheotanytarsus and Tanytarsus, compositions of adult males belonging to these genera were examined. The adult males emerged from materials attached to artificial substrates submerged at rapids or at pools of different sites in altitude, topographic type and electric conductivity in the Ohta River, Hiroshima Prefecture. Each environmental factor was categorized into three ranges and the range in which a species occurred in a significantly large number was regarded as the one the species requires. There after, the differences, in requirements between the congeneric species were examined. As a result, with respect to altitude, Polypedilum hiroshimaense was considered to require high altitude, whereas P. asakawaense and P. convictum; and P. japonicum and P. nubifer, were considered to require middle and low altitude, respectively. R. tamaquintus, R. tamasecundus and R. tamatertius all required high altitude. As regards topographic type, Tanytarsus tamakutibasi required Aa, whereas T. tamaoctavus; and T. oyamai, T. takahashii, T. tamagotoi and T. unagiseptimus required Aa-Bb and Bb/Bc, respectively. For the riverbed type, Cricotopus metatibialis and C. triannulatus; and C. bimaculatus required rapids and pools, respectively. Among the Tanytarsus species, only T. arduennensis required rapids. For electric conductivity, Rheotanytarsus tamaquintus and R. tamatertius required low conductivity. R. tamasecundus and R. fluminis required a middle and high level of conductivity, respectively.

N2  - In order to clarify whether the H. kitaokai adults that appeared during spring and autumn are of the same generation or not, the host-seeking activity of the field-collected adults (collected in the Chichibu Mountains of Saitama Prefecture) was observed in plastic cylinders that had been placed outdoors. The unfed adults collected in April, 1993 (1993-April group), showed high host-seeking activity until May, but the activity was barely observed in August. The unfed adults collected in May, 1996 (1996-May group) also showed a similar activity pattern to the 1993-April group. Both 1993-April and 1996-May groups were dead in October. The unfed adults collected in October, 1993 (1993-October group) showed high activity until early May, 1994,but the activity was barely observed in July. The seasonal activity of the unfed adults collected in October, 1996 (1996-October group) was also similar to that of the 1993-October group, although the activity declined in winter. Both 1993-October and 1996-October groups were dead in August. This suggests that H. kitaokai adults that appeared during spring and autumn in Saitama Prefecture are not of the same generation.

N2  - Investigations on mosquitoes and blackflies to determine a vector of Dirofilaria immitis in residential areas were carried out at 1 site in Oita City and at 3 sites in Hasama Town, Oita Prefecture, from May to December in 1994 and from June to December in 1995. Wild female mosquitoes were collected at night by a light trap, and in the evening by a hand net while being attracted to a collector, or CO_2 gas from dry ice. Among 8 mosquito species collected, Aedes albopictus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus were the most abundant species as a daytime and a nighttime biter, respectively. In all catches, 1 out of 1,009 Ae. albopictus and 2 out of 561 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were naturally infected with third-stage larva(e) of D. immitis. The female mosquitoes with third-stage larva(e) were found from July to September. Adult blackflies (322 females, 7 species) collected by a hand net were all negative with larvae of D. immitis. Considering their anthropophily as well as zoophily, it is concluded that one or both of Ae. albopictus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus play(s) a major role in the transmission of D. immitis among dogs, and also possibly from dogs to humans in the three residential areas studied, and that transmission to humans may occur only during the summer months.

N2  - Two hundred and fifty-four patients with caterpillar dermatitis treated in the Department of Dermatology, Kudanzaka Hospital, from 1977 to 1996,were studied. Of the 254 patients, 163 were male, so the male-female ratio was 1.8 : 1. The ages of patients ranged from 2 to 79. The predominant age was 40 to 59 for male (52% of all males) and 26 to 29 for females. About half of the male patients in the predominant age group came in contact with caterpillars during gardening on weekends. Seasonal prevalence showed two peaks, the maximum was in July and the next highest in September. The causative insect was predominantly thought to be Euproctis pseudoconspersa. During twenty-year period, the highest number of patients visited our clinic in 1996,followed by 1989 and 1984. The relationship between the number of patients and climate conditions, which may affect the population of these insects, was investigated. However, no clear relationship between the two was observed.

N2  - The species composition of the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, and the roof rat, R. rattus, in urban areas is influenced by human activities, especially by factors related to urbanization because of their commensalism. Generally in Japan, the changes in their composition seem to have three phases according to the progress of urbanization. The first phase is evidenced by the predominance of the Norway rat population, the second phase by the resurgence of the roof rat population in urban buildings, and the third phase by the predominance of the roof rat population in residential areas as well as in urban buildings. Wide road coverage modifies probably these typical changes through fragmentation of rat habitats as was suggested in Sapporo, where the roof rat populations in urban buildings have been successfully controlled since the 1980s.

N2  - We studied the effects of winter drought on the overwintering success of larvae and eggs of Tripteroides bambusa in a bamboo grove in northern Kyushu, southwestern Japan. A half of the bamboo stumps which harbored the 3rd and 4th instar larvae of T. bambusa in November 1995 dried up at least once in winter and almost all the larvae in them died. From November 1995 to March 1996,the total number of overwintering 3rd and 4th instar larvae in the study area decreased from 1208 to 225. The incidence of T. bambusa larvae increased from March, when the new cohort from overwintering eggs appeared and the total number of 2nd-4th instar larvae and pupae reached 2994 in May. About a half of them existed in stumps which had dried up at least once in winter, indicating that the overwintering eggs of T. bambusa have desiccation resistance. In spring, T. bambusa became abundant earlier than did other mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus and A. japonicus, and could grow without the major competitors. These overwintering characteristics of T. bambusa can facilitate its predominance in the bamboo grove.

N2  - Chemical and biological control of land-dwelling leech, Haemadipsa japonica, was carried out in Akita Prefecture, north Japan. Two-times spraying of a microcapsule formulation of 5% DEET (June and July) fairly controlled the occurrence of leeches. When entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Fusarium solani (isolated from dead leeches), were infected to leeches, all pests died within 3-4 days post-infection. Also, both fungi were effective against leeches in the field. It was concluded that leeches dwelling around the residential areas can be controlled by 5% DEET, and biological control with fungi could be the most potential way to reduce the impact of the pest in the forest.

N2  - Collections of the adult chironomid midges were carried out by Suzuki on Chichijima and Hahajima, the two major islands of Ogasawara, during the period from April 14 to May 6,1996,by sweeping with insect net during daytime, and with light traps during nighttime. The specimens were preserved in 70% ethanol, and individually mounted in gumchloral solution by Suzuki on slides after digested in alkali and dissected. Only the male specimens were used usually for the species identification. As the results, a total of 21 species were identified, among which only 5 were diagnosed as species in common with the mainland of Japan or elsewhere in the world, and the rest 16 species, including 13 which are described as new species in the present paper, are considered as indigenous to the Ogasawara Islands. A new genus, Hahayusurika, and Paratrissocladius Zavrel, a genus new to Japan, are also recorded in the present paper.

N2  - Toxicities of four insecticides, fenitrothion, fenthion, ethofenprox and fenobucarb, to Chironomus yoshimatsui fourth and first instar larvae collected at 8 localities in Japan were investigated. The population collected in Yumoto Nikko-shi Tochigi-ken, was most sensitive to all insecticides and seems to be a wild type. The other populations had acquired resistance to insecticides; their LC_<50>s rose several tenfold to several hundredfold. Sensitivity depended on the age of larvae; first instars were always more sensitive than fourth instars, although the difference was always less than several tenfold.

The dosage for both Fipronil formulations was 0.01g a.i/m^2 and Bacillus thuringiensis H-14 at 2l/ha (0.2ml/m^2). Fipronil 3G was the most effective larvicide having a residual activity of up to 2 weeks with more than 80% mortality. However, Fipronil 50 SC was also effective up to one week and Bacillus thuringiensis H-14 was effective for 24hr.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Kumamoto Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and adults flying around the collectors at 79 sites in spring of 1996. A total of 12,054 blackflies, 10,826 larvae (89.8% in total number), 1,211 pupae (10.0%) and 17 adults (0.1%), were collected at 69 sites. All these blackflies were classified into 14 species of the two genera Simulium Latreille and Prosimulium Roubaud. Three species, Prosimulium (Prosimulium) yezoense, Simulium (Nevermannia) konoi and S. (N.) mie, were newly recorded from Kumamoto Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (Gnus) bidentatum (52.6% in total number), followed by S. (S.) japonicum (13.6%), S. (N.) uchidai (10.2%). The most widely distributed species was S. (Gn.) bidentatum (55 sites), followed by S. (N.) uchidai (41 sites), S. (S.) japonicum (35 sites) and S. (S.) arakawae (26 sites).

N2  - In October 1995,field rodents and insectivores were captured at 5 localities in Chollanam-do and 3 localities in Choongchongnam-do, and a total of 81 field mice and shrews, including 64 Apodemus agrarius mice, were collected. The antibody positive rate of A. agrarius sera to Orientia tsutsugamushi was 52.4% in average. A total of 6,372 chigger mites were collected from the mice, and 10 species of 4 genera were identified. Leptotrombidium pallidum was predominant in Choong-chongnam-do, whereas L. scutellare was predominant in Chollanam-do. The chigger mites were individually dissected and internal contents were examined for O. tsutsugamushi infection applying IFA and PCR methods. Of 4,315 chigger mites screened by IFA, 115 positive and suspected cases were confirmed by consensus PCR. O. tsutsugamushi was found in 65 chiggers of 5 species, showing 1.51% infection rate in total. The infection rate of each 5 species was 1.64% in L. pallidum, 1.37% in L. scutellare, 1.77% in L. palpale, 1.60% in L. orientale and 1.41% in L. zetum. The detection of O. tsutsugamushi in L. orientale and L. zetum is the first finding in the world. The serotype of O. tsutsugamushi were also studied by analyzing the nucleotide sequences of the strain-specific region of 56 kDa protein, and all of the eight cases were of the F756-like type. This new sero-type was found from 4 species of Leptotrombidium, L. pallidum, L. scutellare, L. palpale and L. orientale.

N2  - Mosquitoes discharge their own saliva into host animals on blood feedings. We compared morphologically and electrophoretically the salivary glands of three species of mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens pallens, before and after blood feeding. Many proteins were discharged from the salivary gland of An. stephensi by a blood feeding. The volume of the lateral lobes of the salivary gland decreased drastically after the blood feeding, but the middle lobe did not change. Several proteins, whose molecular size were 33,35,40,45 and 70kDa, depleted after the blood feeding, when compared on electrophoresis. The amounts of these proteins recovered by day 3 after the blood feeding. Protein contents in the salivary glands of An. stephensi did not change by fructose feeding. On the contrary, there was no change either in the shape or protein content of the salivary gland in Ae. albopictus or Cx. p. pallens after the blood feeding. An antibody to a molecule of the saliva, 130kDa in size, was induced in BALB/c, C3H and C57BL/6 mice, after repeated bites by An. stephensi, and other antibody to 66kDa band was induced in each strain of mice after repeated bites of Cx. p. pallens. In the case of Ae. albopictus, no antibody was detected by immunoblotting. However, an antibody was detected by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was faint cross-reaction among the mouse sera and salivary gland proteins of the three mosquito species by ELISA. A similar tendency was observed in three strains of mice, whose major histocompatibility (H-2) were different from each other.

N2  - Benthic macroinvertebrate densities and selected physico-chemical parameters of two tributaries of the Wekiva River, central Florida, USA, were investigated monthly for two years. Thirty major taxa were enumerated, and 54 organisms identified to genus and/or species. Mean macroinvertebrate density in Blackwater Creek was 843 organisms/m^2 and 1,272 organisms/m^2 in Rock Springs Run. Family Chironomidae (Diptera) numerically dominated the benthos of the streams, comprising 40.9% (Blackwater Creek) and 34.8% (Rock Springs Run) of the total macroinvertebrates collected. This was followed by total Ephemeroptera (14.5%), total Annelida (11.7%), Amphipoda (7.0%) and total Mollusca (5.8%) in Blackwater Creek; total Mollusca (26.9%), total Annelida (12.5%), total Ephemeroptera (7.5%) and Amphipoda (7.2%) in Rock Springs Run. Blackwater Creek supported significantly (P<0.05) more Isopoda, Hydropsychidae and total Trichoptera than Rock Springs Run, while the latter supported significantly more total invertebrates, total Annelida, Oligochaeta, total Mollusca, Gastropoda, and Pelecypoda. Significant correlations found for both streams between invertebrate densities and water parameters were : Oligochaeta with current velocity (P<0.0001,γ=0.68,n=45) and Nematoda with dissolved oxygen (P=0.0006,γ=0.48,n=48). Mean Hilsenhoff water quality biotic index values were 6.17 for Blackwater Creek and 5.96 for Rock Springs Run, indicating good-fair water quality in these systems.

N2  - Effects of abamectin on invertebrate populations in man-made ponds in central Florida were studied. A 0.15 EC formulation of abamectin (AVID^[○!R] was applied at rates of 5.7,11.3,22.7,45.4,and 90.7g AI/ha. Each rate was applied to 3 ponds and 3 untreated ponds were maintained as controls. Pretreatment and periodic posttreatment quantitative samples of zooplankton, and benthic and free-swimming invertebrates in each pond were collected. In the laboratory, all samples were examined, invertebrates identified and counted. The pre-, and posttreatment population data for each invertebrate group were statistically analyzed to determine any significant (P=0.05) reductions due to treatments. Immature insects (Baetis sp., Coleoptera larvae and nymphal Hemiptera) were adversely affected but recovered at 14 days posttreatment in all treated ponds; adult Coleoptera and Hemiptera were not affected. Gastropoda were slightly affected at 2 days posttreatment only at 90.7g AI/ha of abamectin. Chironomid larvae were significantly reduced at all treatment rates for up to 14 days posttreatment. Cladocera (>95% Moina spp.) were reduced to varying degrees at all treatment rates, recovering between 14-53 days posttreatment, depending upon the rate of treatment. Nauplius and adult Copepoda (90% Cyclops spp.) were reduced >99% within 2-7 days posttreatment at 22.7,45.4,and 90.7g AI/ha. They completely recovered between 14-53 days posttreatment in all treated ponds. Ostracods were probably affected adversely by the highest 3 rates of abamectin. Rotifera were not affected in any treated pond. Abamectin caused temporary population reductions of a wide variety of aquatic invertebrates.

N2  - The subtropical climate of Okinawa Prefecture with high temperature and high humidity enables mites to breed easily on house dust. The question arises as to whether it is possible to reduce the density of mites in bedding such as the Japanese mattress "shiki-futon" by domestic cleaning. Toward this, vacuum cleaning on "shiki-futon" was carried out every week. To determine the number of mites, dust from 13 of "shiki-futon" was collected every month for a year. At the end of the one-year study, the number of mites was decreased to below half in nine of the 13 "shiki-futon" studied. When the mite density was high at the beginning, the number of mites decreased significantly. However, if the number of mites was reduced to below 100 mites per square meter of "shiki-futon", the significant effect of vacuum cleaning was not clearly demonstrated, especially when the population of mites was higher on the bedroom floor and/or in another bedding in contact with the "shiki-futon". The average number of mites in "shiki-futon" was reduced gradually, but it was increased during the rainy season (from April to June) in spite of domestic cleaning.

N2  - Major cities such as Sapporo, Sendai, Shinjuku, Yokohama, and Nagoya, Japan, have experienced Rattus rattus infestations since the 1970s. The problem has disappeared in the 1980s in Sapporo where the R. rattus populations have decreased. The causes of the rise and decline were analyzed with aerial photographs of commercial districts in the five cities. In each city, the total basal area of buildings>10m high increased from 5-10% in the mid-1960s to>15% in the 1970s. In 1988-1990,the mean road coverage per hectare for Sapporo was 0.424±0.133ha, which was significantly larger at the 5% level than 0.334±0.156ha, 0.374±0.195ha, 0.351±0.136ha, and 0.374±0.169ha for Sendai, Shinjuku, Yokohama, and Nagoya, respectively. The coefficient of variation of 31.4% for Sapporo was apparently smaller than that for the other cities. Road coverage in Sapporo is generally large, but those in the other cities vary in size which explains Sapporo's low value. The rapid increase of big buildings in the 1970s may have expanded the infestations in most cities. In Sapporo, however, the large road coverage may have fragmented habitats of the rats and it is possible that rat populations declined as a result.

N2  - First-instar larvae of Aedes albopictus naturally infected with a rickettsial endosymbiont (Wolbachia pipientis) were treated with tetracycline. The treatment successfully removed Wolbachia and resulted in establishment of a Wolbachia-free strain. Testing for the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility in the cured and infected strains showed complete incompatibility only in crosses between the infected males and the cured females, which are typical crosses that express cytoplasmic incompatibility in other species.

N2  - Although infestations with the female of Tiga ticks, Ixodes persulcatus Schulze, for humans is frequently observed from spring to early summer seasons, records of parasitism by the male and nymph of this species are few in Japan. In October 1996,one case of infestation with the nymph of I. persulcatus tick was detected in the southern part of Hokkaido. This is the first case caused by the nymphal stage in Hokkaido, but the fifth case in Japan.

N2  - Seventeen cases of human tick bite found in Kyushu, Japan since 1992 were reported. Causative tick species were Ixodes ovatus (1 case), Haemaphysalis flava (5 cases), H. longicornis (8 cases) and Amblyomma testudinarium (3 cases). The case infested with I. ovatus was the first reliable report from Kyushu. One out of 8 cases caused by H. longicornis occurred on an inpatient because he wore pajamas which might have been contaminated with ticks in his housing site. Although one case infested with H. flava showed Lyme disease-like symptoms (erythema migrans, lymphocytoma and flu-like symptoms), Lyme disease was ruled out because of the negative results of Borrelia antibody assyed by two tests (ELISA and Western blotting).

N2  - Field and experimental studies were performed in order to clarify whether the I. ovatus adults observed in forest floor vegetation from spring through summer survived until the following spring. The mark-recapture method was used in the field study in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. A total of 775 I. ovatus adults were marked and released from April to August, 1996; however, not all of them were recaptured in the same survey area the following spring. The host-seeking activity of the unfed adults was observed in plastic cylinders that had been placed outdoors. The unfed adults collected in April, 1993,showed high host-seeking activity until June, but the activity was barely observed in August. The death of all of the unfed adults in a plastic cylinder was observed in September. The unfed adults collected in June, 1996 also showed a similar activity pattern to those collected in April, 1993. The activity in question was barely found beginning in mid-August, 1996. The death of all of the unfed adults in the plastic cylinders was observed in November. These results suggest that most of the I. ovatus adults observed in forest floor vegetation from spring through summer in Saitama Prefecture died in autumn except for those that were parasitic on hosts.

N2  - Effects of pyriproxyfen were investigated in 5 strains of Culex pipiens molestus containing an organophosphorus insecticide resistant strain and a low-level resistant strain against methoprene and pyrethroids. Pyriproxyfen showed potent JH mimic activity in all strains regardless of insecticide resistance. When the susceptibility to pyriproxyfen was examined during the fourth instar to early pupa by 1 r immersion test method, the susceptibility changed markedly depending on the developmental stages. The maximum susceptibility appeared from the fourth day of the fourth instar to 30 in after pupation, and the susceptibility was very low before and after that period. The stage of maximum susceptibility to pyriproxyfen did not coincide with that to methoprene; from the third day of the fourth instar to pupation, suggesting the involvement of different factors in the mode of action. Results of injection test in early pupa indicated that decline in the JH mimic susceptibility mainly depends on the decrease of cellular sensitivity to the JH mimics in the pupa, not on the change in their permeability through the cuticle.

N2  - The longevity and body weight at each developmental stage of Glossina morsitans morsitans were examined under the following conditions : temperature 25±1℃, relative humidity 60±10% and photoperiod 12hr light and 12hr dark. The length of life of male adults (n=93) was 145.9±51.4 days, (m±SD) range 9 to 241 days, and that of female adults (n=73) was 131.1±58.3,range 4 to 208 days. The respective mean body weight was : 1-day-old male pupae, 28.8mg; 3-weeks-old male pupae, 25.1mg; 1-day-old male adults, 20.4mg. The equivalent weights of females were 29.9,26.3 and 22.0mg, respectively. The coefficient of correlation between the body weight of 1-day-old adults and their longevity was 0.005 for males and 0.025 for females, indicating that there was almost no correlation between longevity and body weight.

N2  - From January 1984 to March 1996,1,060 small wild mammals were captured in 80 selected survey sites in Kyoto Prefecture. A total of 115,092 trombiculid mites which belonged to 7 genera and 21 species were recovered from these mammals. By analyzing the results of isolation of Orientia tsutsugamushi and the distribution pattern of trombiculids, we concluded that Leptotrombidium pallidum was the only vector mite of Tsutsugamushi disease endemic in the Nodagawa River basin of Kyoto Prefecture. Mammals captured from several sites in the Nodagawa River basin were more heavily infested with L. pallidum larvae than those at other sites in Kyoto Prefecture. Seasonal emergence pattern of L. pallidum on small mammals in the Nodagawa River basin showed two peaks, one in late autumn and the other in spring, but its activity was not the same on different species of the host rodents. Nevertheless, as activities of vector mites on hosts are more evident in late autumn than in spring, the seasonal incidence of Tsutsugamushi disease in Kyoto Prefecture is most likely from late spring to early summer. It is considered that the preferance of vector mites for hosts influenced the number of cases or seasonal incidence of Tsutsugamushi disease.

N2  - In order to produce large amounts of antigens of Dermatophagoides farinae (DF) and D. pteronyssinus (DP), both of which are very important species as the main inhalant allergens causing allergic diseases, mass-rearing techniques of DF and DP mites were studied. A mixture of 50% fish food powder and 50% dried yeast gave the highest production of both DF and DP, showing 37.0-fold and 51.8-fold increase in number after 12 weeks, respectively. When the same amount of culture media were used, the larger surface of the rearing container gave better production rate in both cases of DF and DP, showing 188.2-fold and 200.8-fold increase, respectively in a 154 (cm)^2 surface container (14cm in diameter) compared to a 79(cm)^2 surface container (10cm in diameter) after 12 weeks. Several different temperature and relative humidity conditions were compared for finding the maximum mass production. The highest production of DF mites resulted when 28℃ and 64% RH were provided, showing 815-fold increase in number after 10 weeks, and followed by 28℃ and 52% RH showing 773.3-fold increase after 10 weeks. In the case of DP mass rearing, the maximum production resulted when 25℃ and 75% RH were given, showing 1,391.7-fold increase in number after 10 weeks, and almost the same production resulted under conditions of 28℃ and 64% RH giving 1,385-fold increase in number after 10 weeks. When a 154(cm)^2 surface container was used, the optimum amount of culture media was 50g, and satisfactory result was obtained when the culture was started with 1,500 seed mites. During 20 weeks' observation period, the peak in number was obtained after 10 weeks of the culture in all test groups of DF and DP, and thereafter the number decreased.

N2  - The redback spider, Latrodectus hasseltii, which is widely distributed throughout tropical and temperate regions worldwide was not known in Japan until it was collected and identified in Osaka Prefecture in the fall of 1995. Since then, many redback spiders were found in Osaka and Mie Prefectures. The field investigation showed that these spiders distribute in extensive areas of Osaka Bay and Yokkaichi Port in Japan. The tolerance to low temperature was tested with redback spiders collected in the above areas by individual rearing in glass flasks at 5-25℃ (10L : 14D) in laboratory. They showed appreciable cold tolerance and they also tolerated well to a high temperature (40℃). These findings suggest the possibility of the distribution of redback spider in wider areas in Japan in the near future and occurrence of lactrodectism in this country.

The cases of immature I. nipponensis fed on reptile were recorded in Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures. In a case in Aomori Prefecture, five larval and one nymphal I. nipponensis mingled with seven larval I. persulcatus on the same host. The engorged larvae of I. persulcatus detached from the host in this case molted to nymphs successfully.

A total of 22,935 blackflies, 20,066 larvae (87.5% in total number), 2,867 pupae (12.5%) and 2 adults (0.01%), were collected at 128 sites. All these blackflies were classified into 18 species of the genus Simulium Latreille and Prosimulium Roubaud. Four species, Simulium (Gomphostilbia) shogakii, S. (Gnus) daisense, S. (Gn.) kisoense and S. (Simulium) nikkoense, were newly recorded from Fukushima Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (Odagmia) aokii (29.6% in total number), followed by S.

N2  - Lethal and knockdown effects of several insecticides to red-back widow spiders, Latrodectus hasseltii, were evaluated. Spiders were collected three times in Osaka and Mie Prefectures, Japan, in 1995 and 1996. In the continuous contact method on glass pot and the topical application method, permethrin and phenothrin were most effective among the tested insecticides. Knockdown and lethal effects by spraying with commercial insecticide aerosols, containing pyrethroids, were sufficient in the case of direct spraying without the web, but the effects decreased in the case of spraying through the web.

N2  - In order to clarify the existence of the behavioural diapause of Ixodes ovatus adults, the host-seeking and -feeding activities of unfed females that were exposed to a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D) during the egg to unfed adult stages were observed under experimental conditions. The host-seeking activity of the unfed females was rarely observed for about 10 months after molting occurred. The percentage of host attachment for the unfed females was very high (63.3-66.7%) even 1-3 months after they had molted. However, their engorgement percentage was very low (4.4%) even 6 or more months after they had molted. These results suggest that unfed I. ovatus females exposed to a long-day photoperiod enter behavioural diapause and postpone host-feeding and -seeking activities during a period of about 10 months after molting occurred. This diapause seems to explain the disappearance of I. ovatus adults in autumn (October to December) in the Chichibu Mountains.

N2  - Established populations of Aedes albopictus in the USA were first discovered in Texas, in 1985. Currently, Ae. albopictus has spread to at least 25 southeastern, mid-Atlantic and some mid-Western states in the continental USA. The introduction of Ae. albopicitus in the USA seems to have occurred through used tires arriving from northern Asia. The rapid spread of Ae. albopictus in the USA has heightened human health concerns because of the known and potential vector relationships of Ae. albopictus with several arboviruses of public health importance. Thusfar, in the USA, four arboviruses have been isolated from specimens collected in Missouri, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Illinois. Among control methods, source reduction and public education and awareness of the biology and ecology of this mosquito are the primary targets. Biological control agents, such as predatory Toxorhynchites mosquitoes, species of copepods, and Bacillus thuringiensis serovar. israelensis (B. t. i.) have been tested and/or used in the field to reduce Ae. albopictus larvae. Use of repellents and other personal protection strategies against bites of Ae. albopictus have been investigated. A laboratory study employing several organophosphates, pyrethroids, microbial pesticides (B. t. i. and Bacillus sphaericus) and insect growth regulators (IGRs), against larvae of a Florida laboratory population of Ae. albopictus indicated the general toxicity ranking : IGRs>pyrethroids>OPs>microbials. In a few laboratory and/or field studies, selected adulticides and larvicides (including time-release formulations) have shown good potential for the control of this mosquito. Mosquito adulticides, such as malathion, permethrin, Scourge^[○!R](synergized resmethrin) and others used in various situations in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States, probably reduce populations of Ae. albopictus.

N2  - Water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, was evaluated as to whether its appearance could be useful as an indicator to show the absence of Anopheles sundaicus larvae in the coastal area of the Asahan Province in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The water hyacinth was distributed along the coast in water bodies in which salinity was less than 0.2%. No An. sundaicus larva was found breeding in waters with hyacinths. In waters without any macrophyte vegetation, the larvae were frequently found in the range of 0.0% to 4.0% salinity. The susceptibility test revealed that the plant could not tolerate 0.32% salinity and began withering, but they were thriving at 0.24% salinity or less after 2 days exposure. It was concluded that the water hyacinth is a suitable plant for the detecting of An. sundaicus larval habitats and/or brackish water bodies in coastal flats.

N2  - Responses of larval populations to crowding were compared between 2 strains of Aedes albopictus from Nagasaki (NG), Japan and Chiangmai (CM), Thailand. Newly hatched larvae were reared with 6 different initial densities from 8 to 256 larvae/vial. The daily survival rate of old larvae and the number of produced pupae/vial differed between the 2 strains in high density-cohorts, while in low density-cohorts both strains showed similar responses to larval crowding. The differences in developmental time from hatch to pupation and in size of pupae were not significant between the strains, although the increased density resulted in delayed development of larvae and smaller pupae in both strains. The analysis of density-dependence of larval mortality showed different sensitivity to larval crowding between the 2 strains; the CM strain was more sensitive than the NG strain. Based on these results, the differences in growth pattern of laboratory populations between the 2 strains were discussed.

N2  - A total of 11,373 permethrin-treated common and Olyset^[○!R](Sumika Life-Tech Co., Osaka) nets was distributed to 64 villages from October 1993 to February 1996 for the Pilot Malaria Control Program in Honiara. To monitor the efficacy of the nets, the chemical and biological assays were made. The gas chromatographic analysis of 206 nets showed an average surface dose of 258.1mg per m^2 of net, and 46.6 and 37% to retain the entomologically and epidemiologically effective doses of 60 and 100mg/m^2,respectively. Olyset nets lost 76% of the surface dose of permethrin by one washing with soap, but regained 82% by exposing to strong sunlight. The bioassay suggested that under the natural context Anopheles farauti escaped from the entomologically effective net before taking up a lethal dose due to the repellency and irritancy. From the results, it is recommended washing nets without soap, timely retreating common nets with permethrin, and reactivating Olyset nets by exposing to strong sunlight.

N2  - The influence of food and water on the movement of adult German cockroaches from an occupied harbourage shelter to a vacant new shelter was studied. A shelter (5×5×0.5cm) occupied and conditioned by cockroaches and a vacant new shelter were placed in one test container (13×22×7cm) and the change in cockroach distribution was observed. When food and water were placed near one of the two shelters and a barrier plate was set between the two, most of the cockroaches chose the shelter closer to the food and water, regardless whether the shelter was of conditioned or new. However, females, especially in the case there was no barrier, tended to remain in the conditioned shelter.

N2  - From April 1991 to July 1995,we surveyed by flagging the geological and vertical distributions of adult ticks, and also their seasonal occurrences in the Kyushu mainland, Japan. A total of 3,815 unfed adult ticks which were collected at 14 localities consisted of four genera and 13 species; Amblyomma testudinarium, Dermacentor taiwanensis, Haemaphysalis flava, H. longicornis, H. kitaokai, H. hystricis, H. megaspinosa, H. campanulata, H. formosensis, Ixodes ovatus, I. persulcatus, I. monospinosus and I. nipponensis. Tick fauna in the southern part of Kyushu was abundant in species and numbers; especially the genus Haemaphysalis tick was predominant while in the northern part it was relatively scarce. The genus Ixodes ticks including I. persulcatus, a typical northern species, were found around 800-1,300m above sea level in Kuju and Sobo Mountains. Mt. Kuju apparently is the southern limit for I. persulcatus distribution.

N2  - In the autumn of 1995,we had an opportunity to witness and evaluate the importance of the mass, probably transoceanic, migratory flight and landing of Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven in the campus of Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Kyushu, western Japan. On October 25 (14 : 30 to 17 : 30,fine) and 26 (10 : 30 to 17 : 40,fine), they were seen flying in large numbers from the northwest to southeast across the top of the laboratory building (about 10m in height). They flew continuously in the direction of the wind and we caught some of them at the top of the building. They flew vigorously, with many flying well beyond the reach of our insect nets and without changing course. Some flies reaching the building in the evening landed on the concrete wall of the building. The migratory flights were simultaneously observed in Fukuoka where the flies were seen flying from the north across Tsushima-Kaikyo Strait. Fukuoka and Nagasaki are situated about 250 to 300km southeast of the Korean Penninsula. It could be inferred that these flies migrate across from the Asian continent to the main island Kyushu. C. nigribarbis has been considered to migrate altitudinally in the mainland Japan. However, the number of flies found in autumn (November) in Kyushu appears to be also increased by the transoceanic migration.

N2  - The total effective temperature that was required for development was compared among five tick species : Haemaphysalis longicornis, H. flava, Ixodes ovatus, I. persulcatus, and I. nipponensis. The total effective temperature was the largest in I. ovatus and was the smallest in H. longicornis. In general, the total effective temperature was smaller in the two Haemaphysalis species than in the three Ixodes species. This suggests that the time for the completion of the life cycle is longer in the Ixodes species than in the Haemaphysalis species. Judging from the quantity of the total effective temperature, developmental velocity, and the existence of diapause, the life cycle of the three Ixodes species seems to be completed in more than a year, but that of two Haemaphysalis species in less than a year.

N2  - We measured major mite and cockroarch allergens in indoor environment with immunoassay using allergen-specific antibody. It is impossible to count airborne particles microscopically in some airborne allergens derived from mites, cockroarches, cats, and laboratory animals, which can only be detected with immunoassay. Other advantages of the assay are that it is much easier to be standardized and allergen contents can be expressed in absolute units. The major issues discussed in this review are : (1) levels of major allergens in houses, (2) evaluation of countermeasures for reducing exposure to airborne allergens, and (3) particle sizes of airborne allergens.

N2  - Daytime collections of adult chironomids resting on the shore and those floating on the water surface were carried out on February 8,1995,on a day in the coldest winter season of a year under the atmospheric temperature of about 8℃. A total of 76 adult male specimens were collected, and 60 among them were Biwatendipes motoharui Tokunaga, 3 were Biwatendipes biwamosaicus sp. nov., 5 were Hydrobaenus biwaquartus Sasa et Kawai, 1 was Hydrobaenus biwagrandis sp. nov., 1 was Orthocladius biwaniger Sasa et Kawai, 3 were Smittia aterrima (Meigen), 3 were Smittia nudipennis (Goetghebuer). The new species Biwatendipes biwamosaicus sp. nov. is quite unusual in the structure, the apical scales of tibiae and the hypopygium of males are characteristic of Biwatendipes, but the structure of head is similar to that of females, and wings are extremely wide.

N2  - A persistent DDT residual spray in the past made Anopheles farauti, a major vector of malaria in Solomon Islands, exophagic and early evening biting. To cope with these adverse behaviors of mosquitos, we tested a series of self-made inexpensive smoke formulae for the entomological and epidemiological effectiveness. Mosquito candles, saw dust of 0.4% d-allethrin packed in empty beer cans, repelled 75% of mosquito bites at Tenaru Mala of 127 population in Guadalcanal. Mosquito bars, the similarly treated saw dust molded in a bar shape with tapioca starch, reduced PCD malaria incidence ratios of bar users to non-users from 0.39-0.65 to 0.06-0.14 at Gibert Camp of 914 population in Honiara. Fortified mosquito coils of 0.4% d-allethrin also reduced malaria prevalence of 450 students from 32.7% to 8.8% at the dorms of Ruavatu Secondary School. Nightly lighting of the coils kept the new malaria incidences lower than the recovery rates. These inexpensive smoke formulae could provide an effective antimalaria measure for exophagic and pre-bednet time biting mosquitos in supplement of mosquito nets.

N2  - A total of 11,373 permethrin-treated mosquito nets was distributed to 64 villages from October 1993 to February 1996 in Honiara (an estimated population of 64,000), Solomon Islands, where other control measures had been implemented. As the result, the malaria incidence by passive case detection (PCD) dropped to 44.4% from a peak of 1,087/1,000 in 1993 to 605 in 1995,and is projected to drop to 182 in the end of 1996. A population cross-sectional distribution of 2,000 (Olyset)^[○!R]nets (permethrin-pretreated) to pregnant women dropped the number of monthly infected babies from 110 to 54,and the ratio of low-birth-weight babies below 2.1kg from 4.2% to 1.9% in 2 months. The distribution of Olyset nets to the 15 Guadalcanal villages also dropped the monthly number of PCD incidence from 120 to 58 for a period of 10 months. An interview survey showed only 50% of Honiarans had mosquito nets, 91% complied with them, washed them 1.45 times a year without retreatment, and an owner of 0.8-1.0 net was infected less with malaria. Complete net coverage and retreatment were urged for further effects.

N2  - The seasonal occurrence of unfed larvae of trombiculid mites was surveyed in four fixed areas using Tullgren funnel method from June 1994 to May 1995. Eleven trombiculid species were collected from soil samples : Leptotrombidium scutellare, L. kuroshio, L. pallidum, L. kitasatoi, L. fuji, L. kansai, Neoschoengastia shiraii, Walchia ogatai, W. koshikiensis, Gahrliepia saduski and Doloisia sp., with L. scutellare, L. pallidum, and L. fuji being dominant species. L. scutellare occurred from October to February with a sharp peak in October and November. L. pallidum occurred from August to May with a broad peak in October to March. L. fuji occurred from October to April. As to the summer trombiculid fauna, L. pallidum was included among 7 constituent trombiculids, but L. scutellare was not. Consequently, tsutsugamushi disease is probably transmitted by L. scutellare and L. pallidum in late autumn and early winter, and by L. pallidum in other seasons. L. scutellare larvae were collected from grasslands, groves, gardens of the housing lots and farmlands mainly with a black cloth.

N2  - The Japanese species of the genus Desmometopa Loew are revised. Of three known species from Japan, two species reported as D. tarsalis Loew and D. tristicula Hendel are proven to be D. microps Lamb and D. sordida Fallen, respectively. Two species, D. m-nigrum (Zetterstedt) and D. varipalpis Malloch are newly recorded from Japan. Short redescriptions of five species are added with illustrations of head, pleuron and male genitalia. A key to the Japanese species is presented.

N2  - Development of Anopheles sinensis larvae and pupae was studied in net cages floated in rice fields or a swamp from March through November in Saga, southwest Japan. Food supply shortened larval durations, indicating that nutrition was suboptimal in the field condition. The development threshold and thermal constant for larvae were ca. 10℃ and 164 day-degrees, respectively, and those for pupae ca. 6℃ and 38 day-degrees. Proportions of instar durations to the whole larval duration were independent from temperature and nutrition. Empirical equations were given for estimating temperatures at the water surface (microhabitat of anopheline immatures) in rice fields from air temperatures.

N2  - Movement of adult German cockroaches from an occupied harbour-age shelter to a vacant new shelter was studied. A shelter (5×5×0.5cm) occupied and conditioned by cockroaches and a vacant new shelter were placed together in one test container (13×22×7cm), and the change in cockroach distribution was observed. The number of cockroaches moving to the new shelter increased depending on the population density. When a barrier plate with a passage opening of 10×5mm was set between the two shelters, many females occasionally stayed in the old shelter even under high population density. These results suggested that females did not move so easily to the new shelter as males did.

N2  - The effect of repeated removal in a survey of the seasonal activity of Ixodes ovatus adults by flagging vegetation was determined by the use of the mark-recapture method. I. ovatus adults showed high activity on vegetation during the period from April to mid-July, 1996. However, the activity abruptly decreased from late July and was hardly discernible in late August. The proportions of ticks recaptured increased with progressive survey dates except for those in late May, mid-June, and mid-August. On the final survey date in late August, all the captured ticks were marked ones. These results suggest that the duration and abundance of the seasonal activity of I. ovatus adults are influenced by repeated removal.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Gifu Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and of adults flying around the collectors at 111 sites in summer of 1994. A total of 18,481 blackflies, 16,576 larvae (89.7% in total number), 1,896 pupae (10.3%) and 9 adults (0.05%), were collected at 103 sites. All these blackflies were classified into 23 species of the genus Simulium Latreille and Prosimulium Roubaud. Three species, Simulium (Nevermannia) fontinale Radzivilovskaya 1948,S.(Gnus) sp. and S. sp. Y were newly recorded from Gifu Prefecture and the former was recorded for the first time from Japan. The most abundant species was S.(Simulium) kawamurae (26.6% in total number), followed by S.(S.) japonicum (23.3%), S.(Odagmia) aokii (13.6%), S.(Gnus) bidentatum (12.5%), S.(S.) suzukii (7.7%) and S.(N.) uchidai (6.1%). The most widely distributed species was S.(S.) japonicum (50 sites), followed by S.(N.) uchidai (49 sites), S.(O.) aokii (47 sites), S.(Gn.) bidentatum (46 sites), S.(S.) suzukii (46 sites), S.(S.) kawamurae (32 sites) and S.(Gomphostilbia) shogakii (29 sites).

N2  - The species composition and abundance of the chironomid midges were investigated by using a board trap during the period from March to May 1994 at three different stations along the shoreline in the eastern part of Lake Kawaguchi. A total of 38,498 adult midges were collected, the great majority (98.4%) of which were Biwatendipes tsukubaensis Sasa et Ueno. This was followed by Glyptotendipes tokunagai Sasa, (1.1%) and then a very low representation of Chironomus yoshimatsui Martin et Sublette and C. plumosus Linnaeus (0.5%). The dominant species of chironomids which emerged from the littoral region of the lake, however, changed with the month. First, massive emergence of B. tsukubaensis began from mid-March to late April, and then G. tokunagai from late March to early May. From mid-April, C. yoshimatsui emerged and was followed by C. plumosus. Thus, the period in which the four main chironomid species continuously emerged was from mid-March to early May. Therefore, throughout the spring season people living around the lake have the strong impression that the nuisance of chironomid midges has continuously increased and that these are attracted to the light of hotels, houses and some buildings during the breeding season.

N2  - Determination of the chemical properties of the venom of Chiracanthium japonicum, which is well known as the most medically important spider in Japan, was studied. The venom was prepared by dissecting out the venom glands from mature female spiders. Then the glands were homogenized in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with a glass homogenizer. The clear, viscous surpernatant obtained by centrifugation was stored in a small vial and regarded as the crude venom. This venom was fractionated on a Sephadex G-200 column. The white mice (JCL) were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2ml of different concentrations of the fractionated venom. The lethal activity was noted. Lethal activity was fractionated on a CM Sephadex C-50 column. The fractions were regarded as the purified venom. The toxic responses to mice were dyspnea, prostration, flaccid paralysis and death. The lethal activity was determined to be neurotoxic in action. The minimal lethal dose (MLD) of the purified venom for mice was 10μg. The house-fly was used for the toxicity test. The LD_<50> was 0.069μg/honsefly. The erythematic activity on rabbit hide was examined by injecting the venom intradermally. The minimal redness dose (MRD) to evoke 10×10mm size of redness in the rabbit was 0.7μg. The molecular weight of purified protein was 63,000±2,000. The toxicity to mice was completely destroyed by heating at 60℃ in 10 minutes and lost at 0℃ in five to seven days.

N2  - Efficacy of several insecticides against a main vector of Chagas disease in Guatemala, Triatoma dimidiata (Hemiptera; Reduviidae) was evaluated in the laboratory. Diazinon, fenitrothion, permethrin and propoxur were found to be effective showing high mortality of more than 90% at a dose of 250mg/m^2 within 24 hours. The knockdown effect of these chemicals to the 3-5 instar nymph and the adult was lower than that to the 1st instar nymph. Although 100% mortality was obtained with 240- and 60-minute-contact to almost all the insecticides, the mortality with 15-minute-contact varied between 46.7% and 96.7%. The high knockdown effect of permethrin lasted for 57 days, while the residual effect of the other 3 compounds was reduced steeply. When the nymphs were arbitrarily exposed to the insecticide in their hiding place, the mortality after 24 hours increased in a dose-dependent manner (from 2.5mg/m^2 to 250mg/m^2 of the active ingredient). The mud wall (bajareque) decreased the knockdown effect of 7 formulations. Emulsifiable concentrations of permethrin and etofenprox showed quick action with filter paper while they were affected by the absorption property of the wall. These results suggested that the selection of formulation was important for field application as well as the selection of insecticides.

N2  - An investigation of the life history of Boettcherisca septentrionalis Rohdendorf was made in Nagasaki Prefecture, Western Japan from January 1990 to December 1994. A trap baited with horse meat was maintained at each of 3 altitudes, 5m, 500m and 1,000m, on Mt. Gokahara-dake. The number of flies captured was recorded once a month. The larvae and pupae which had bred from meat in the trap were also counted and transferred into a separate trap for emergence. The middle region of the mountain was considered as a primary habitat of this flesh fly. At altitude 5m, all pupae were observed to enter diapause in fall. At altitudes 500m and 1,000m, most pupae entered diapause, but some adults emerged in fall and might be overwintered at the middle of mountain. Adults emerged at altitude 1,000m probably migrated to the middle of mountain for hibernation before winter. After hibernation, males and females copulate in April, and females migrate again to higher altitudes for larviposition in early summer. From diapause pupae, adults emerged in May (alt. 5m), May to June (alt. 500m) and May to July (alt. 1,000m). All life stages were observed during summer when it seems to be the best season for breeding at all altitudes (51,000m). Boettcherisca septentrionalis is a long day insect and have 1-2 generations during summer in Western Japan.

N2  - The mature larvae of the flesh fly, Boettcherisca peregrina, normally required 12 days to develop to adults at 25℃ in dry condition. When the mature larvae were immersed in water, their development was arrested. However, their further development was resumed when they were transferred to dry condition. The rates of survival and adult emergence in the mature larvae did not change during 10 days of immersion but these rates decresed to zero by the additional immersion for another 5 days. During immersion for 14 days, the total lipid content of the immersed larvae decreased drastically from 6% to 1% of body weight, although that of the normal developing larvae placed in dry condition did not decrease markedly. One of main fatty acids in the lipid of B. peregrina was arachidonic acid and this fatty acid comprised of 10.5% in the total fatty acids extracted from the mature larvae. During normal adult development, absolute amount of arachidonic acid decreased to 43% of that in the normal mature larvae. This decrease was more conspicuous in larvae immersed in water. The amount decreased to 22% after 10 days and 9% after 14 days immersion, respectively. Whereas other fatty acids did not decrease so marked as arachidonic acid. These results suggest that there may be a threshold content of arachidonic acid to complete successful larval-pupal and pupal-adult development in B. peregrina.

N2  - Anticoagulant activities of the salivary glands (SG) of the blood sucking kissing bug, Rhodnius prolixus, were analyzed. The crude SG extract showed strong activity to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and also weak activity in elongation of prothrombin time (PT). Inhibition activities of SG extract to the factors in the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways were analyzed. SG extract showed high inhibition activity to the IXa/VIIIa/phospholipid (PL) complex (Xase complex) and low to serine protease, kallikrein, factor XIIa, and factor IIa. However SG extract did not show inhibition activity to factors XIa and Xa. These results indicate that SG contains a strong inhibitor of Xase complex in the intrinsic coagulation pathway and an inhibitor of factor IIa in the common pathway. Both anticoagulant factors were separated into two fractions by gel filtration (GF).

N2  - Proteins in venom glands of Latrodectus hasseltii collected in Osaka area were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Several main bands with molecular weight of 110-120kD were clearly recognized after protein staining. Around 45kD area several distinct bands were also presented and another many bands were presented from smaller than 20kD to greater than 200kD. Monoclonal antibodies against α-latrotoxin of L. tredecimguttatus bound to 110-120kD bands and also 45kD bands. Lyophilized venom gland-extract imported from Australia showed a different pattern of protein bands on SDS-PAGE gel, i. e. 110-120kD bands were not clearly recognized as major bands and new band appeared around 77kD area. From the result of binding of monoclonal antibodies to 77kD bands it was suggested that these bands are degraded product of α-latrotoxin. All mice injected with venom gland-extract of one female spider died within 2 days after injection. Lyophilized venom gland-extract showed less toxicity than our preparation of venom glands of the red back spider collected in Osaka-City. Clear decrease of body weight of mice injected with the venom was observed during 2 days after injection. Present results clearly showed that red back spiders collected in Osaka had an α-latrotoxin in their venom glands and the toxicity was not weak referring to previous data of toxicity of widow spiders.

N2  - The normal and insecticide-stimulated antennal and leg grooming activity of Blattella germanica from a laboratory, VPI, and field, RHA strain was investigated. The grooming/min by adult males following exposure to glass plates without insecticide, and with residues of 0.025 and 0.049μg cypermethrin/(cm)^2 (VPI), and 0.049 and 0.392μg cypermethrin/(cm)^2 (RHA) was recorded during 20 min exposure periods. Exposure to insecticide residue caused the antennal grooming/min of VPI strain to increase by more than 3-fold and the leg grooming/min to decrease by more than 3-fold. Exposure to insecticide residue caused the leg grooming of RHA strain to increase by more than 2-fold and the antennal grooming to increase slightly. The differences in the antennal and leg grooming activity between these two strains may be attributed to adaptions to the mass rearing conditions characteristic of laboratory colonies (VPI), and the organic and inorganic debris that may contaminate household substrates of a field strain (RHA).

N2  - Five species of natural enemies are reported for the first time from blackfly larvae in mainland China. The chytrid fungus Coelomycidium simulii infected less than 15% of two species. The microsporidian protozoa Amblyospora bracteata, Janacekia debaisieuxi, and Polydispyrenia simulii infected 2.4% of S. equinum, 8.3% of S. nikkoense, and 3.8% of S. taiwanicum, respectively. The trichomycete Harpella melusinae was attached to the peritrophic membrane of Simulium taiwanicum.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Hiroshima Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and of adults flying around the collectors at 84 sites in spring of 1993. A total of 8,892 blackflies, 7,313 larvae (82.2% in total number), 1,574 pupae (17.7%) and 5 adults (0.1%), were collected at 83 sites. All these blackflies were classified into twenty species of the two genera Prosimulium and Simulium. Twelve species, Prosimulium (Prosimulium) kanii, P. (P.) kiotoense, P. (P.) yezoense, Simulium (Nevermannia) konoi, S. (N.) mie, S. (N.) subcostatum, S. (Gomphostilbia) ogatai, S. (Gom.) shogakii, S. (Gnus) daisense, S. (Gn.) nacojapi, S. (Simulium) quinquestriatum and S. (S.) rufibasis were newly recorded from Hiroshima Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (N.) uchidai (40.2% in total number), followed by S. (N.) konoi (13.5%), S. (Gn.) bidentatum (11.9%), S. (S.) japonicum (10.2%) and S. (S.) arakawae (9.9%). The most widely distributed species was S. (N.) uchidai (70 sites), followed by S. (Gn.) bidentatum (33 sites), S. (S.) arakawae (32 sites), S. (S.) japonicum (29 sites), S. (N.) subcostatum (28 sites) and S. (O.) aokii (26 sites).

N2  - The redback spider, Latrodectus hasseltii, is a common venomous spider in Australia. This species had not been recorded in Japan until late 1995. Large numbers of redback spiders were collected in Osaka City and in Yokkaichi City, Mie Prefecture, in November 1995. Another species of widow spiders, namely, the brown widow spider L. geometricus, was also collected in various ports : Yokohama, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and in Okinawa. The author has reviewed current available information on widow spiders including the life cycle, reproduction, hunting behavior, systematics and distribution of each species, etc. The invasion route of these species into Japan is also discussed. The invasion of redback spiders into Japan apparently dates back several years as frequently old, empty egg sacs have been found. There is no information on how the redback spiders survived the winter season in Japan. Fortunately, so far in Japan no biting cases have been reported.

Trapping sites were classified into eight types, and 179 species of flies belonging to twenty four families were collected. The trapping site similarities were clustered by Pianka's α index. Composition rate of 47 dominant species in each trapping site was analyzed.

N2  - Larval polytene chromosome banding patterns of Simulium (Simulium) eximium de Meijere, 1913 collected from West Java and Sumatra in Indonesia were observed and a standard map was presented. This species had three chromosome pairs which were numbered I-III in decreasing order of size. Each centromere of all chromosomes was distinguished by an expanded region with heterochromatin. A haplotype involving two distinctive heterochromatic bands in the centromere (21A) and section 20B of the chromosome I was heterozygous in most of the males from the population of Puncak (West Java) and appeared to be sex-linked. The differences in chromosomal polymorphism, coupled with those in sex-related banding, suggest that two sibling species exist in the S. (S.) eximium morphospecies, one in Puncak (West Java) and the other in Danau Ranau (South Sumatra).

Regeneration process of efficacy of the used net against Aedes aegypti was also studied. When the net was hung down at openings of houses to control dengue vector mosquitoes in Vietnam, permethrin remained 79% and 58% of the initial content in the nets used inside and outside a house after 7 months, respectively. When an unused net was washed with acetone to remove the active ingredient from the surface of thread, diffusion of the active ingredient from the inside of thread to the surface was accelerated by keeping the net at 60 to 70℃.

N2  - The host attachment and host-seeking activities of unfed Ixodes nipponensis adults were examined when they were exposed to a long day photoperiod (16L-8D) during the stages from engorged nymph to unfed adult. The percentage of host attachment of unfed females was very low (4.6-6.7%) at the ages of 1-3 months after molting, but high (48.4%) at that of 5-6 months. The host-seeking behavior of unfed adults was scarcely found for about 4 months after molting. These results suggest that unfed I. nipponensis adults molted from the nymphs exposed to a long-day photoperiod enter diapause and their host-seeking activities are low for about 4 months after molting. This diapause seems to explain the disappearance of I. nipponensis adults in early autumn (September).

N2  - Anopheles sundaicus is an important vector mosquito of malaria along coastal areas of Southeast Asia. The ecological characteristics of An. sundaicus are diversified as to time and/or the area as reported by different investigators. Here, some characteristics such as larval habitat, seasonal prevalence, biting behavior and DDT resistance are reviewed, and the significance of the diversity of each characteristic is discussed. The common characteristics of An. sundaicus found in all areas and times were limited as follows "the larvae need stagnant water with a definite range of salinity and plenty of sunlight, and the adults feed on a blood meal at night." Other characteristics were somewhat different. The diversities of seasonal prevalence and DDT resistance of the mosquito were well explained by the differences in habitat conditions and their fluctuation patterns, and by the histories of genetical selections through DDT spraying, respectively. While, the diversities of biting behavior such as endo-exophagy, host selection etc. might not be explained by so simple. For example, though there are some reports which mention the genetic change in the anthropophily of An. sundaicus, the change is possibly only an appearance because of the host preference expressed by "human blood index." This is caused by a relative change in number of feeding hosts such as human and monkey. Even if the diversity is genetically caused, what is unknown about An. sundaicus is whether the host-selective behavior changes qualitatively from anthropophily to zoophily (or its reverse) within the individual mosquito, or changes quantitatively from strong anthropophily to a weak one (or its reverse) as a characteristic of each individual mosquito. Throughout the discussion above, the importance of genetic ecology in the field studies for An. sundaicus is emphasized.

N2  - During the years 1991 to 1994,the fauna of ixodid ticks and tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsiae in Tokunoshima Island, one of the Nansei Islands in Japan was surveyed to clarify the epidemiological background of spotted fever group rickettsiosis on this Island. A total of 304 ticks collected were the following 4 genera and 8 species; Amblyomma testudinarium, Dermacentor taiwanensis, Haemaphysalis formosensis, H. hystricis, H. longicornis, H. pentalagi, Haemaphysalis sp. T and Ixodes granulatus. Of 90 ticks consisting of A. testudinarium, D. taiwanensis, H. formosensis, H. hystricis and H. sp. T examined for rickettsiae, A. testudinarium yielded 8 strains which were the first isolates from ticks in Tokunoshima Island. Serotyping showed that the present all isolates were the unclassified AT-1 serotype belonging to the spotted fever group isolated from A. testudinarium in Shikoku, Japan.

N2  - Surveys of domestic mites were conducted in living-and bedrooms of 20 concrete-built apartments in and around Nagoya City, from September 1983 to June 1984 at approximately three-month intervals. Multiple regression technique was first applied to elucidate the influence of housing conditions on the prevalence of mites, and then the resultant standard partial regression coefficients were used as explanatory variables for the cluster analysis of mites and housing conditions. The mites were largely classified into two groups, regardless of clustering methods; Ward's, median and furtherest neighbour methods. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Cheyletidae formed one cluster. These mites seemed to be better adapted to a relatively humid environment, since they had positive correlation with family size and air-conditioning and negative correlation with age of house, floor level, and house-cleaning frequency. The rest of mites, D. farinae, Haplochthonius simplex, Tarsonemidae, Cosmochthonius reticulatus, Glycyphagidae, and Acaridae formed the other cluster. Of these mites, C. reticulatus and Glycyphagidae, and Tarsonemidae, H. simplex and Acaridae were classified into two subgroups. However, the position of D. farinae in the dendrograms varied by the methods applied. The reason for this was considered that there were no significant factors influencing the prevalence of D. farinae in the apartments surveyed in this study. The housing conditions were also classified into two groups. One cluster consisted of family size, air-conditioning, and floor level. The other cluster consisted of the number of rooms, flooring score, type of bedding, working status of housewife, age of house, and house-cleaning frequency. These results suggested that the prevalence of domestic mites in homes is a reflection of the interrelationship between the biological characteristics of mites, especially their humidity requirements, and degree of humidity in homes largely influenced by house-hold activities, dwelling space and distance from the ground surface.

N2  - The final (8th) instar larvae of smoky brown cockroach (Periplaneta fuliginosa S.) were used to determine the changes in hemolymph volume, blood sugar titer, fat body and content of glycogen in the fat body during the fast with or without water supply. The results are summarized as follows. 1. The cockroaches decreased in body weight during the fast, especially when the water supply was concurrently cut off. The cockroaches died of hunger in 25 to 60 days, and water supply would not help to prolong their life. 2. In the fast which was supplied with water, the hemolymph volume increased, and the percentage of hemolymph volume based on body weight rose to 30%. If the water supply was concurrently cut off, however, the hemolymph volume gradually decreased and the percentage-based body weight declined to below 8%. However, in the early days of the fast, the blood sugar titer was kept in a normal state whether there was any water supply or not. But when the fast had continued over 8 days, the blood sugar titer gradually declined in the treatment which was supplied with water and rose in that with the water supply cut off. 3. Fat body and content of glycogen in the fat body decreased during the fast whether there was any water supply or not. The content of glycogen in normal larvae was about 11-13mg/g, but after 28 days of the fast, it declined to 1mg/g. 4. Development of the cockroaches remained stagnant during the fast. But when supplied with food and water again, even the larvae of cockroach which had fasted for 32 days revived and grew to adult.

N2  - In order to find out water quality indicators based on chironomid communities, adult males obtained from the larval samples attaching to the upper surface of concrete plates were examined at 16 sites of 2 river basins at different trophic levels. As a result, a total of 959 males belonging to 69 species were collected, and subfamilies Chironominae and Orthocladiinae were dominant in terms of number of species and number of males, respectively. The evenness component diversity of a chironomid community at a pool of water showed significant negative correlation with the electric conductivity of the water. Some species were considered to have restricted distribution concerning the electric conductivity ranges. That is, Thienemanniella majuscula, Polypedilum surugense and Rheotanytarsus aestuarius may be distributed only in waters at low, moderate and high electric conductivity levels, respectively. Orthocladius glabripennis, Cladotanytarsus vanderwulpi and Thienemannimyia lentiginosa were dominant in communities at rapid only in low, moderate and high electric conductivity ranges, respectively, although these species showed wide distribution with respect to electric conductivity. Similarly, Cricotopus bimaculatus, Polypedilum tsukubaense and P. cultellatum were dominant at pool only in low, moderate and high electric conductivity ranges, respectively. These results suggest the validity of the evenness component diversity of a chironomid community, and occurrence and dominance of some species, attaching to the upper surface of concrete plates, as biological indicators exclusively reflecting the trophic status of the water.

All the three species had three paired chromosomes (2n=6) and showed other main characteristics in common, such as a Balbiani ring, a double bubble, a parabalbiani ring and a nucleolar organizer on the same arm of the same chromosome. However, their precise locations were different among the species. All species had prominent centromeres, the banding patterns of which were different among them. In S. bidentatum and S. aokii polymorphic inversions were found in low frequencies, and B-chromosomes were also detected. Any sex chromosomes or sex-linked segments could not be detected.

N2  - Polytene chromosome study of the Oriental Simuliidae has been only scantily made. Larval salivary gland chromosomes of the blackfly, Simulium (Gomphostilbia) sundaicum Edwards, 1934,from Java, Indonesia, were observed and their standard maps were constructed. This species had three pairs of polytene chromosomes. The chromosome I and II were metacentric and the chromosome III was submetacentric. Each centromere consisted of a large conspicuous heterochromatic segment in all chromosomes. The large heterochromatin was associated with each other in some cells. The nucleolar organizer was located in section 19 of chromosome I. The Balbiani ring, the double bubble and the Parabalbiani ring were situated in section 49C, 48 and 64C of chromosome II, respectively. Five inversions were found, but none of them was sex-related. C-band staining successfully revealed that band of 84A, centromeric of chromosome III, was heterozygously stained, slightly and heavily in males, while homozygously stained, only heavily in females. Then the slightly stained band could be ascribed to Y-chromosomal, and the heavily stained, to X-chromosomal.

N2  - To confirm the density and seasonal prevalence of Anopheles minimus, and chemical characteristics of its larval habitats, surveys in 30 streams were carried out in Ishigaki Is. of the Ryukyu Archipelago from 1990 to 1994. The larvae and pupae of An. minimus were collected in 20 out of 30 streams. This species is widely distributed throughout Ishigaki Island except the urban area. High density of immatures on the coastal forests in north and low density in farmlands on the central area were observed. The water quality of streams where many immatures of An. minimus were found was relatively clean. The number of An. minimus immatures increased gradually from April and peaked in July to September. From November, the population gradually decreased to the lowest in March.

N2  - Myiasis is the infestation with dipteran larvae which, at least for certain periods, feed on the host's dead or living tissue, liquid body-substances, or ingested food (Zumpt, 1965). Flies of this type include blowflies, also called greenbottle or bluebottle flies (Calliphoridae), flesh flies (Sarcophagidae), and also house flies (Muscidae)(Krinsky, 1988). The authors have already reported two cases of otomyiasis due to Sarcophaga peregrina (Japanese name : senchi-nikubae) and S. similis (Japanese name : nami-nikubae) (Sarcophagidae), which occurred in September, 1993 (Chigusa et al., 1994). In the present paper we report two cases of wound myiasis due to Lucilia sericata (Japanese name : hirozu-kinbae) and L. illustris (Japanese name : midori-kinbae), which infested an 87-year-old woman and a 37-year-old female patient suffering from schizophrenia in May and June 1994,respectively. Although Hasegawa et al. (1979) reported human myiasis is probably due to L. illustris, identification was done only from the larvae and not the adult fly; therefore, this is the first unequivocal report of human myiasis due to this species in Japan.

N2  - Aqueous foam was evaluated as a carrier for applying termiticide to voids beneath concrete slabs for subterranean termite control. Evaluations were conducted using liquid and a combination of liquid and foam to apply fenvalerate 1% a.i. to subslab voids. The liquid was applied with a fan nozzle through holes drilled 30cm apart and 15cm from an edge. The liquid was applied at 75% or the label-recommended volume, which was followed by the foam applied for the remaining 25% of the recommended volume of termiticide. The foam was applied using a commercial foam-generation machine, a surfactant, and a straight stream nozzle. Application was made through the same holes as the liquid. The soil was sampled at four sites beneath the slab, and insecticide residue analysis conducted by gas chromatography. Results show that liquid and the liquid and foam combination can create a continuous and nearly uniform band of insecticide-treated soil.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Iwate Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and of adults flying around the collectors at 155 localities in spring of 1992. A total of 17,615 larvae (82.2% in total number), 3,801 pupae (17.7%) and 15 adults (0.1%) belonging to three genera and 22 species were collected at 150 sites. Ten known species of three genera, Prosimulium (Twinnia) japonense, P. (T.) cannibora, P. (Prosimulium) jezonicum, P. (P.) kanii, P. (P.) kiotoense, Cnephia (Stegopterna) nukabirana, Simulium (Nevermannia) subcostatum, S. (N.) mie, S. (Gnus) bidentatum and S. (Simulium) kawamurae were newly recorded from Iwate Prefecture. Cp. (St.) nukabirana was secondarily recorded, and P. (T.) cannibora was thirdly recorded from Japan. The most abundant species was P. (P.) jezonicum (42.4% in total number), followed by S. (S.) japonicum (20.3%), S. (Odagmia) aokii (9.2%) and P. (P.) yezoense (7.2%). The most widely distributed species was S. (S.) japonicum (112 sites), followed by P. (P.) jezonicum (101 sites), S. (N.) subcostatum (70 sites), P. (P.) yezoense (57 sites) and S. (O.) aokii (48 sites).

N2  - The twelfth case of Dermatobia hominis myiasis imported into Japan was reported. Two weeks after a trip to Brazil, a 21-year-old man visited the dermatology clinic with indurated frunculoid lesion on the right upper arm. Oral antibiotic therapy was ineffective. The eruption started with a mosquito bite in the tropical forest and became an inflammed nodule with a central opening from which serosanguinous fluid oozed. He noted a little white body protruding in and out of the nodule and succeeded in taking out this worm from the lesion by himself. The worm was identified as Dermatobia hominis. The clinical features of 12 reported cases of Dermatobia hominis myiasis in Japan were reviewed.

N2  - Transovarial transmission of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (Rt) was experimentally demonstrated after establishment of infected laboratory colonies of Leptotrombidium deliense, L. fletcheri, L. arenicola and L. pallidum. Even if Rt is acquired by uninfected trombiculid larvae while feeding on infected rodents, it is not transmitted to progeny of the trombiculids. From these observations, trombiculid mites are considered to be the reservoirs as well as the vectors of Rt. Transovarial and filial infection rates were generally about 100%, but infected female produce largely uninfected offspring in a few cases. The adults of infected colonie of 3 species other than L. pallidum were mostly female, and the sex ratio in the infected L. fletcheri seemed to be controlled by Rt. In the adult stage of L. pallidum individuals, although Rt was seen in all the organs and tissues, it was distributed most densely in the salivary gland and ovary. Because the density of Rt was markedly different among cells in the same organ, it is considered that Rt does not transfer from one cell to another in trombiculids. Rt was found in many cells in the early stages of spermiogenesis, but was excluded from cytoplasm of these cells during the maturation process, resulting in the production of Rt-free mature sperms and spermatophores in the infected male trombiculid.

N2  - A questionnaire study was done in June and August, 1987,in Saga City, Japan, to know the frequency of mosquito bites, prevalence and effects of anti-mosquito measures, and citizens' view on mosquito problems. Mean numbers of bites were 0.99 (June) and 0.95 (August) per day per person staying at home throughout the day, with maximums of 9 (June) and 14 (August). Three quarters of those persons received 1 or less bite per day. More (64%) bites were received during the daytime (sunrise to sunset). Of daytime bites, 60% were outdoors, whereas 70% were indoors at night. The number of bites outside home (offices, schools and so on) was much fewer than that at home. Seventy percent of houses were equipped with screens at all windows. The most popular anti-mosquito measure was electric-heating insecticide mats followed by insecticide sprays and mosquito coils, whereas mosquito nets were used in only 15% of houses. Window screens reduced the number of indoor bites, whereas the frequency of use of antimosquito measures positively correlated with the number of indoor bites, suggesting that insecticides were used after mosquito bites rather than a preventive measure. Persons receiving more mosquito bites had stronger attitudes toward mosquito control by the public service. More than a half of persons receiving 2 or more bites per day considered that the mosquito problem was intolerable and the control is necessary. As a whole, 42% of persons regarded the mosquito problem tolerable, whereas 41% regarded it intolerable, with only 3% who regarded mosquito problems negligible (the rest did not give answer to this inquiry).

N2  - The influence of feeding histories on the food selection of the German cockroach is reported. Adult cockroaches were fed with one of three types of foods, rice bran, dried fruit (apricot), and a dried meat product (dog food jerky), for 18,10,or 5 days before 2 days of starvation. They were then allowed to feed freely on two of the three, including the food experienced just before. The cockroaches usually preferred the other food to the experienced, or more liked the other than before. Nymphs also showed similar responses.

N2  - The effects of photoperiod on host attachment activity and development in the tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, were observed at 25℃ under two photoperiodic conditions (10L-14D and 16L-8D). The development of engorged larvae and engorged nymphs was hardly affected by photoperiod during the stages from egg to engorged larva or engorged nymph. However, the host attachment activities of unfed nymphs and unfed adults were significantly suppressed by exposure to a short-day photoperiod (10L-14D) during the stages from egg to unfed nymph or unfed adult. These results suggest that diapause occurs in unfed nymphs and unfed adults which were exposed to short-day photoperiod, but not in engorged larvae and engorged nymphs. In Saitama Prefecture, the disappearance of H. longicornis nymphs in autumn may be related to the diapause of the unfed nymphs. However, the low activity of the adults in autumn can not be fully explained by the diapause, because the adults develop in the long-days of spring to summer.

N2  - A great number of stink bugs migrated and invaded into the indoor for hibernation, and became a nuisance in an elementary school in Hokkaido every year. We examined the effects of soundproof double windows and application of concentrated cyphenothrin to the window frames on the control of bugs invasion into the school building. The soundproof window had preventive effect on the invasion, number of bugs gotten in the rooms decreased to one-sixth comparing with conventional double windows. Residual treatment of cyphenothrin to the window frames enhanced the effectiveness.

N2  - Surveys of domestic mites were carried out in livingrooms and bedrooms of 20 concrete-built apartments in and around Nagoya City, from September 1983 to June 1984 at about 3-month intervals. Multiple regression technique was applied to elucidate the influence of housing conditions on the prevalence of mites. Major housing conditions were selected by backward elimination method. The annual mean densities of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus were positively correlated with family size and air-conditioning and inversely with age of house, floor level, and house-cleaning frequency. There was good agreement between the mite densities observed and estimated by the multiple regression equation. While similar factors were detected for the total number of mites and Cheyletidae, no significant factor was detected for D. farinae. Haplochthonius simplex had positive correlation with the number of rooms and air-conditioning, and negative correlation with age of house, floor level, and house-cleaning frequency. No positive factor was detected for Cosmochthonius reticulatus, which had negative correlation with floor level. Working housewife, air-conditioning and the number of rooms were positive factors for Tarsonemidae, Glycyphagidae and Acaridae, respectively, and age of house, cleaning frequency, and floor level were negative factors for most of the mites, although the extent of influence of these factors considerably varied by mite species. The number of mite species correlated positively with the number of rooms, air-conditioning, and flooring scores, and inversely with age of house, floor level, and house-cleaning frequency, whereas Simpson's indexes of diversity had positive correlation with air-conditioning, and negative correlation with the number of rooms and flooring scores. These results suggested that the difference in mite prevalence in homes is mostly due to the interrelationship between the biological characteristics of mites and degree of humidity in homes largely influenced by household activities, dwelling space and floor level, i.e., distance from the ground surface.

N2  - The Height of attachment to host was investigated in two species of ticks, Haemaphysalis megaspinosa and Haemaphysalis longicornis, in the southern part of Chiba Prefecture from March to May in 1992 and 1993. Laboratory experiment showed the attaching H. longicornis adults fell off more easily than H. longicornis nymphs. We wore flannel clothes marked at intervals of 10cm to record the attachment height of ticks. We walked in the study site and collected ticks that attached to our clothes. H. megaspinosa was mostly collected. There was no significant difference between the height of attachment to man and the height of ticks remaining on plants. Though H. megaspinosa nymphs were collected at higher positions on plants than H. longicornis nymphs, there was no significant difference between them in the height of attachment.

N2  - During the years 1993 to 1995,a total of 3,480 ticks were collected by flagging on vegetation and from field rodents in various sites spread throughout the mainland of Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. These were identified as three genera and 11 species as follows : Amblyomma testudinarium, Haemaphysalis flava, H. formosensis, H. hystricis, H. kitaokai, H. longicornis, H. megaspinosa, H. sp., Ixodes nipponensis, I. ovatus and I. turdus. Of these species, H. formosensis, H. hystricis and H. sp. were newly recorded in this area. H. flava, H. formosensis and H. longicornis were the predominant species. In a review of the present and other previous reports, four genera and 16 species of ticks were summarized from the mainland of Kagoshima Prefecture. In L-929 cell culture, five strains of unknown spotted fever group rickettsiae were isolated from I. ovatus adults. In isolation of Borrelia spirochetes with BSK culture, two larval and one nymphal I. ovatus and one Apodemus speciosus mouse were positive for Borrelia japonica.

N2  - As it was reported that hydramethylnon was excreted in the feces of bait-fed German cockroaches before being killed and coprophagous uptake by other cockroaches resulted in high mortality, we observed how long such a secondary killing effect lasts and how effectively kill them in the laboratory condition. A group of 30 1st instar nymphs was exposed to the feces excreted by 25 male bait-fed cockroaches for 10 days and the mortality rate was counted, and new group was re-introduced with 10 days intervals until the mortality dropped to the control level. The mortality rate was 81.1% in average of 1st-5th tests, 61.5% in 6th-14th tests and 15.2% in 15th-18th tests, showing 57.6% (943 dead/1,636 exposed) of the cumulative mortality rate during 180 days of the study period. When 25 4th-5th instar nymphs were exposed to hydramethylnon instead of 25 males, the mortality rate was 79.5%, 37.8%, 17.9% in average of 1st-6th tests, 7th-13th tests and 14th-17th tests, respectively, showing 48.9% (799 dead/1,635 exposed) of the cumulative rate during 180 days of the study period.

N2  - Acetophenone, a keton, was demonstrated to cause acute and delayed types of insecticidal and ovicidal activities against the mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, under laboratory conditions. At 0.05-10ppm, acetophenone induced cumulative (larvicidal+pupicidal+adulticidal) mortality in a concentration-activity manner. Delayed activity of acetophenone was detected in the F_1 progeny showing lower fecundity and significant larval mortality. Morphological aberrations were evident in the larvae, pupae and adults, i.e., larval shortening, larval-pupal intermediates and incomplete emergence of adults at 0.05-10ppm. Acetophenone also caused significant ovicidal activity at concentrations of 0.1-10ppm.

N2  - The host attachment and host-seeking activities of unfed Ixodes persulcatus females were examined when they were exposed to a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D) during the stages from egg to unfed adult. The percentage of host attachment of unfed females was low during 3 or more months after molting. Vertical activity of unfed females in the plastic cylinder was scarcely found during 10 or more months after molting. These results suggest that unfed I. persulcatus females exposed to a long-day photoperiod enter behavioural diapause and postpone feeding and host-seeking activities over a long period. This diapause explains the disappearance of I. persulcatus adults in autumn.

The survival of both mosquito species decreased substantially when reared at the density of 1 larva/ml of water than at the density of 1 larva/8ml. The larval and pupal periods were also substantially longer at the density of 1 larva/ml than at the density of 1 larva/8ml. The rearing of the 2 mosquito species together at different combination ratios (300 : 100,200 : 200 and 100 : 300) revealed that Cx. quinquefasciatus was a superior competitor than Cx. p. molestus as indicated by the difference between expected and realized ratios of the emerging adults.

N2  - A mark-release-recapture experiment of Aedes albopictus was carried out in Nagasaki, Japan. A total of 1,478 unfed females of 4-5 days after emergence was sprayed with 0.5% water solution of Rhodamine B and released into an isolated, small, grassy and scrub area. Human bait collections were made for 9 days at 10 fixed collection points to observe the temporal and spatial variations of released females. A total of 348 females was recaptured and the recapture rate was 23.55%. The variations in the number of marked females among 10 collection points were analyzed by multiple log-regression analysis using the number of unmarked females in each collection point and the distance from the release point as independent variables. The relative importance of the distance in explaining the number of marked females at each collection point was the highest just after the release and then became lower according to days post-release, whereas the relative importance of the number of unmarked females became higher with increasing days post-release. The probability of surviving and staying in the release point and in the study area was estimated as 0.299 and 0.429,respectively, by log-regression analysis of the temporal changes in the number of recaptured females.

N2  - Larval salivary gland chromosomes of the blackfly, Simulium (Gomphostilbia) yaeyamaense Takaoka, 1991,from the Yaeyama Island group of the Ryukyu archipelago, were observed and mapped. This species had three pairs of polytene chromosomes. The longest pair, chromosome I, is metacentric and the two shorter pairs, chromosomes II and III, in descending order of length, are submetacentric. The centromeric region of all chromosomes was not expanded and barely recognized by the existence of a heavy band. The nucleolar organizer was situated in section 18 of chromosome I. The Balbiani ring, double bubble and the Parabalbiani ring were situated in sections 47,46 and 61 of chromosome II, respectively. From three populations examined, one inversion (IIIL-1) was always heterozygous in females, and four other inversions (IIIL-2,IIIL-3,IIIL-4 and IIIL-5), were polymorphic and found as heterozygote in both sexes. This study is the first to map the larval salivary gland chromosomes of the subgenus Gomphostilbia, and to record the heterozygous inversion related to the female sex among the Oriental Simuliidae.

N2  - The ixodid tick, Ixodes persulcatus, is a principal vector for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu Iato. To examine whether the infection affects the tick development, the amount of oviposited eggs, hatchability, molting rate from larvae to nymphs, and body sizes of nymphs and adults were compared between the infected and noninfected groups. No remarkable differences were observed in these parameters. Comparison was also made on the blood-feeding activity. The infected nymphs showed the same activity as the noninfected ones. These results suggest that the spirochete may act as a commensal in the tick host.

N2  - Diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of a heleomyzid fly, Tephrochlamys japonica, were surveyed at three points : a pig pen, poultry house and cattle shed, of the Faculty of Agriculture, Meijo University Farm, at Kasugai, near Nagoya, in central Japan. The total specimens were collected by fly-paper strips, light traps, and on glass windows. According to observation of the diurnal activity of this species, it was found to have two peaks, one in the morning (7 : 00-10 : 00) and the other in the afternoon (16 : 00-19 : 00). The largest numbers of flies were trapped in the temperature range of 21 to 25℃ and under illumination of 1,000 to 3,000lx, during the day. Seasonal prevalence of T. japonica in central Japan showed two peaks, the first in April and the second, the following January.

N2  - Collections of chironomid midges were carried out by H. Suzuki on May 18 to 20,1994,on Kuchinoshima and Nakanoshima of the Tokara Islands, by sweeping bushes near their breeding places (mainly rice paddies and small streams) with insect net during daytime, and also by operating a light trap at night. As the results, a total of 266 males of the family Chironomidae were individually mounted on slides for identification, and they were classified into as many as 49 chironomid species, including 17 new species. Twenty four species among them were in common with those of the mainland of Japan, and 15 were in common with the Nansei Islands; 8 species among them were in common both with the mainland of Japan and the Nansei Islands, but 7 were estimated as being in common with the species indigenous to the Nansei Islands, which invaded the Tokara Islands by crossing the Watase Line. It was also noted that Chironomus yoshimatsui, a species most commonly found in the polluted sewage ditches in the mainland of Japan but not in those of the Nansei Islands, is distributed to Tokara.

N2  - Twenty-nine spontaneous gynandromorphs in the mosquito, Aedes togoi, were analyzed in order to construct an embryonic fate map. The estimated distances on the blastula between primordial discs for the abdomen, genitalia, antenna, palp, and wing showed sufficient consistency to form the map. In Aedes, sex is determined by the sex factors M and m, with males being heterogametic and females homogametic mm. The mechanism by which a gynandromorph is produced in this insect can be ascribed to double fertilization of a binucleate egg by spermatozoa carrying different sex factors. The two nuclei undergo nuclear division and resultant nuclei form two clusters of different sexes and cover the blastoderm surface. Primordial discs are then developed after cell division. Because this process is conceived to be equivalent to that a sexual boundary separates the cells on the blastoderm at random, distances between the primordial discs of structures can be estimated from their segregation ratios of sex in gynandromorphs. The results of the present study are expected to provide a better understanding of how the mosquito gynandromorph is produced.

N2  - In the southern part of Chiba Prefecture, we collected 24,539 ticks of 2 genera including 6 species on Sika deer Cervus nippon in October, 1990,August, 1993,and February and March, 1994. Haemaphysalis megaspinosa was the dominant species in October (92.9% of male, 89.8% of female, 91.2% of nymph), February (78.5% of male, 65.3% of female, 83.0% of nymph) and March (73.1% of male, 62.9% of female, 48.1% of nymph), but, in August H. longicornis was dominant (97.8% of male, 98.8% of female, 98.4% of nymph). Furthermore, we collected 10,928 ticks on vegetation by the flagging method in the Sika deer habitat on respective months from 1990 to 1994. The dominant species of ticks on Sika deer were approximately similar to the results of the flagging method. But, Ixodes turdus was collected only by the flagging method, and I. ovatus was collected only on deer.

N2  - Two species of swimming pool mites, Hydronothrus crispus (Hc; Cryptostigmata, Trhypochthoniidae) and Schwiebea sp. (Sch; Astigmata, Acaridae) were cultured in vitro, and their allergenicities were investigated by RAST using sera obtained from 32 swimmers and 43 randomly selected, healthy non-swimmer athletes. Positive rates for Sch-, Hc-, and Dermatophagoides farinae (Df; Astigmata, Pyroglyphidae)-RAST was 28.1,25.0 and 59.4% in swimmers, and 31.8,31.8 and 63.6% in non-swimmers, respectively. Both Hc- and Sch-RAST reactions were similarly inhibited by the addition of Sch, Hc and Df antigens. Df-RAST was inhibited by Df itself but not by Sch and Hc antigens. And the RAST values were highly correlated with each other. These facts indicate that there are strong antigenic cross-reactivities among Sch, Hc, and Df. From these results, the author concludes that the swimming pool mites have active allergenic components, which are common with those of Df.

N2  - The movement and oviposition of Aedes albopictus were examined by a combination of mark-release-recapture experiment and an ovi-trap survey of egg numbers in Nagasaki, Japan. Fed mosquitoes were marked with fluorescent dye and released into an isolated, small, grassy and scrub area on the campus of Nagasaki University School of Medicine. Twenty ovi-traps were distributed evenly in the study area and the number of eggs was examined for 2 weeks and 9 days before and after the release, respectively. Human bait collections were made at 10 collection points also in the same period. The multiple regression analysis was applied to the observed differences in egg density among ovi-traps after the release and those in recaptured mosquitoes. The baseline data collected before the release were used as independent variables. The results showed a high correlation between the number of eggs deposited in an ovi-trap and the distance from the release point to the ovi-trap. The number of recaptured females in a collection site showed a high correlation with the distance from the release point during the first 2 days after the release. However, on the 4-5th day after the release, the number of recaptured females showed a higher correlation with the number of unmarked females.

N2  - The common method of isolation of house dust mites from house dust has been done by using 0.075 mm-mesh sieve. In the present study, we tried to isolate house dust mites, especially Tarsonemid mites, by using 0.053 mm-mesh sieve in addition to 0.075 mm-mesh sieve, and the isolation efficiency was compared with that using 0.075 mm-mesh sieve only. As the result, 78.4% of Tarsonemid mites was found on the 0.053mm mesh, and the total number of Tarsonemid mites was far different from the number of mites on the 0.075mm mesh. Tarsonemid mites were also found in high rates (12.9-39.5%) in the houses surveyed in this study.

N2  - The long-term effects of sublethal concentrations of fenoxycarb [ethyl 2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy) ethylcarbamate] were studied against mosquitoes by treating late third instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus Say and Culex pipiens molestus Forskal (laboratory colonies) under laboratory conditions. The sublethal effects of fenoxycarb demonstrated a significant relation between concentration and cumulative mortality. Fenoxycarb, when applied at 0.0025-0.05ppb, induced long-term sublethal effects as indicated by the significantly reduced egg hatchability and survival of the different stages (larva, pupa and adult) in the offsprings of Cx. p. molestus. No similar long-term effects were observed in Cx. quinquefasciatus.

N2  - A twelve-month study was initiated to determine the presence and species composition of mosquitoes breeding in the septic tanks in the University of Mosul, north of Iraq (latitude 36°N) during the period of June 1988-June 1989. Based on the identification of male genitalia and ratio of female autogeny, this study revealed that Culex quinquefasciatus Say and Culex pipiens molestus Forskal breed together in the same septic tanks. In the fall and winter months (October-January), larvae and pupae of Cx. p. molestus were more abundant than those of Cx. quinquefasciatus. The presence of Cx. quinquefasciatus in Mosul (northern Iraq) is the first record.

N2  - The molting percentages of the non-diapausing and diapausing groups of engorged I. persulcatus larvae and nymphs were compared after exposure to a low temperature (-5℃) for 1-50 days. The molting percentages of the engorged larvae and nymphs decreased as the duration of the treatment was prolonged. In both engorged larvae and nymphs, there was no great difference in the molting percentage between the non-diapausing and diapausing groups. This suggests that the increase of the cold tolerance by diapause did not occur in engorged I. persulcatus larvae and nymphs.

N2  - A collection of adult chironomid midges resting on walls of buildings on the shore of Lake Biwa at Uchidehama, Ohtsu City, was carried out using sucking tubes during the daytime on March 1 and 2,1994,during the coldest season of the year. Altogether 50 male specimens were examined after digested in 10% potassium solution, dissected, and mounted on slides in gumchloral medium. The majority of the specimens was those of Biwatendipes motoharui Tokunaga, 1965,and a few specimens of Hydrobaenus biwaquartus (Sasa et Kawai, 1987) but two new species were also included, namely Orthocladius biwainfirmus sp. nov. and Orthocladius biwaniger sp. nov.

N2  - To investigate the possibility of cockroach control with UV radiation in a natural habitat, population fluctuation of the German cockroach before and after setting of 10W germicidal lamps was examined by the mark-recapture method. The population size at each census was calculated by Jolly-Seber's triple catch method. Results indicated that the population density decreased to about 1/13 within a month. The control effect was different among the places where the germicidal lamps were set.

N2  - Morphometrical study on male genitalia and female wing venation of Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Baghdad origin) and Culex pipiens molestus Forskal (Mosul, 450km north of Baghdad) revealed that these mosquitoes can be differentiated from each other. Measurements of the dorsal (D) and ventral (V) arms of the phallosome (male genitalia) demonstrated that the ratios of D/V for Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. p. molestus were 0.337 and 1.434 respectively and the ratios of DV/D were 1.054 and -1.137 respectively on average. The measurements of R-cell and M-cell ratios of the right wing of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. p. molestus showed that their means were 303.08 and 347.66 (R-cell) and 185.02 and 170.17 (M-cell) respectively. These values were significantly different between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. p. molestus with marginal error in the R-cell and M-cell ratios.

N2  - The synergistic effect of synergists, MGK 264,Synepirin 500 and piperonyl butoxide, combined with eight pyrethroids were evaluated on the adult cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, by using the film contact method. MGK 264 was the most effective. The mixtures of eight pyrethroids combined with MGK 264 at a ratio of 1 : 5 were estimated to be 4.88,8.39,4.71,8.11,4.50,5.88,8.84,and 2.50 times as toxic as d-allethrin, permethrin, phenothrin, cyphenothrin, prallethrin, d-resmethrin, cyfluthrin, and empenthrin alone, respectively. The synergistic effects of Synepirin 500 and piperonyl butoxide combined with pyrethroids were inferior to that of MGK 264. The effects of empenthrin, cyphenothrin, cyfluthrin and prallethrin increased proportionately with increase in combination ratio of MGK between 1 : 1.25 and 1 : 20.

N2  - Adopting the individual rearing method, the present study was carried out to observe the effect of temperatures ranging from 0 to 30℃ at intervals of 5℃ and a graded series of relative humidity from 64% up on the life cycle of Glycyphagus domesticus. Relative humidity was regulated using saturated salt solutions, NH_4NO_3 (64.5-69.1% RH), NaCl (74.7-76.0% RH), KCl (80.6-87.3% RH) and KNO_3 (91.4-93.5% RH) and water (94.0-100.0% RH). The diet was a mixture of dry yeast powder and fish meal powder in the same ratio by weight. At 30℃ and 91.5% RH or 80.6% RH, the eggs did not hatch. At 10℃ and 100.0% RH, egg hatchability was maximum. The molting rates from egg to adult were high with combinations of low temperatures and high relative humidity and low at high temperatures (above 20℃). The rate of emergence of hypopi increased as the temperature rose and the humidity decreased. At 5℃ and 87.1% RH there was high molting rate to adults, the same as at 10℃, but the life cycle was prolonged (about 130 days). At 0℃ and 81.9% RH, the eggs did not hatch until 127 days, but were hatchable. The minimum time required to develop from egg to adult was 16.3±1.7 days, at 25℃ and 94.0% RH. The lower temperature and lower relative humidity prolonged the duration of development from egg to adult. The maximum average number of eggs laid by one female, 118.7±23.3,occurred at 15℃ and 87.3% RH. The maximum reproduction index obtained by Miyamoto (1974), 158.7,was at 10℃ and 87.3% RH. The eggs were highly resistant to low temperature. They lived up to 60 days at -10℃ but for only one day at -20℃. The hypopi molted to tritonymphs at 15℃ and both 87.3 and 100.0% RH. Comfortable life conditions for G. domesticus were temperatures of 10 to 15℃ and humidity above 87.3% RH.

N2  - Surveys of domestic mites were carried out in 21 wooden houses in and around Nagoya City from September 1983 to June 1984 at about 3-month intervals. The relationship between housing conditions and the prevalence of mites was first examined by multiple regression analysis, then the resultant standard partial regression coefficients were used as explanatory variables of cluster analysis. The mites were classified into two groups. Dermatophagoides farinae, Haplochthonius simplex, Tarsonemidae and Cosmochthonius reticulatus formed one cluster. These mites seemed to be better adapted to a relatively dry environment, since they had a significant positive correlation with the number of rooms and negative correlation with family size, except for C. reticulatus. D. pteronyssinus, Glycyphagidae, Cheyletidae and Acaridae formed the other cluster. They seemed to be better adapted to a relatively damp environment, because D. pteronyssinus, Glycyphagidae and Acaridae are known to have high humidity requirements. Glycyphagidae had a significant positive correlation with family size and working housewife, and negative correlation with the number of rooms and age of house. Housing conditions were also classified into two groups. One group consisted of the number of rooms, types of flooring and heating system, age of house, and air conditioning. These were considered to be dry factors. The other group consisted of family size, working housewife, house-cleaning frequency, and type of bedding. Family size and working housewife were considered to be humid factors. These results suggested that the difference in the prevalence of mites was a reflection of the interrelationship between the biological characteristics of mites, especially their humidity requirements, and the degree of dampness in houses largely influenced by household activities and dwelling space.

N2  - In order to elucidate the housing conditions and prevalence of mites characteristic of homes with allergic children, surveys of domestic mites were conducted in 22 wooden houses in and around Nagoya City from September 1983 to June 1984 at about 3-month intervals. Allergic children suffering from bronchial asthma or atopic dermatitis and positive to house dust mites (RAST scores, 3 to 4) were found in 11 homes. They had been given a set of instructions for preventive measures against allergy. The remaining 11 homes had no allergic children and served as controls. The data were examined by Student's t-test of mean difference and linear discriminant analysis. There was no significant difference in the housing conditions between the two groups of homes, except that flooring scores were significantly lower in the homes of allergic children. In some of them, floors of tatami or carpet had been replaced with wooden or plastic floors as a preventive measure. The flooring score was also selected as a significant variable in discriminating the two groups of homes. The classification accuracy was 90.5% before the selection of variables and 76.2% after the selection. While the density of D. farinae and the total number of mites were significantly less in the homes of allergic children than in the control homes, Simpson's indexes of diversity were significantly higher in the former. The diversity index and the densities of D. farinae and Acaridae were selected as significant variables in discriminating the two groups of homes. The classification accuracy by the analysis of mite prevalence was 100% before the selection of variables and 90.9% after the selection. The lower flooring scores most likely explained why fewer D. farinae and the lower total number of mites were detected from the homes of allergic children than from the control homes. The results also suggested that the indoor air humidity in the homes of allergic children might be higher than that in the control homes.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Niigata Prefecture were studied based on the collections of larvae and pupae from streams and adults flying around the collectors at 111 localities in the summer of 1992. A total of 11,497 blackflies, 9,774 larvae, 1,702 pupae and 21 adults, were collected at 90 sites. The fauna composed of 18 species belonging to 2 genera. Four species, Simulium (Gomphostilbia) shogakii, S. (Gnus) malyshevi, S. (Eusimulium) sp. H. and S. (E.) sp. Y., were newly recorded from Niigata Prefecture. The most abundant species was S. (Simulium) japonicum (38.6%), followed by S. (Nevermannia) uchidai (21.9%), S. (S.) suzukii (13.2%), S. (Odagmia) aokii (8.2%) and S. (Gom.) shogakii (5.3%). The most widely distributed species was S. (S.) japonicum (60 sites). Other four species, S. (N.) uchidai (60 sites), followed by S. (S.) suzukii (51 sites), S. (O.) aokii (31 sites) and S. (Gom.) shogakii (26 sites), were also collected at many localities.

N2  - We evaluate the effectiveness of a stream of hot air from a hair dryer for killing eggs and adults of human body lice, Pediculus humanus corporis. All adult lice treated with hot air at 50℃ for 5min did not survive, although all adult lice treated with cool air at 27-28℃ for 5min survived normally. In the exposure of hot air at 55℃ for 1min or more all adults died. The stream of hot air at 60℃ also killed all adults even when exposure was brief (for 30sec). Louse eggs treated with hot air at 55℃ for more than 90 sec never hatched. The escape behaviour of adult lice treated with hot air at 50℃ was observed and the average speed travelled by a female adult was 6.9mm/sec and by a male adult 7.3mm/sec.

N2  - Houseflies collected from six places in Nepal in August 1992 and colonized in the laboratory were examined for susceptibility to eight insecticides by a topical application method. Most adult houseflies were more susceptible to the insecticides tested than those of the susceptible strain (Takatsuki). Two pyrethroid insecticides, d-t, allethrin and permethrin, showed low LD-50 values.

N2  - A field test to ascertain susceptibility level of the housefly, Musca domestica Linnaeus, to five kinds of insecticides viz, malathion, fenitrothion, propoxor, fenothrin and permethrin, was carried out on four wild colonies collected from Allahabad, India. Impregnated filter paper method, short time contact method and residual effect test were adopted. The results of experiments reveal that the Indian houseflies are more susceptible to malathion than Takatsuki strain, but susceptibility levels for the other four insecticides were approximately the same in the two strains. Susceptibility level of Musca domestica and M. sorbens Wiedemann to fenothrin and permethrin was tested. Their susceptibility level was neary the same results.

N2  - The genus Chrysomya Rob.-Desvoidy is remarkable for having several times produced a derived male form with sharply demarcated enlarged upper and small lower ommatidia. The original (normal) form shows a gradual reduction from top to bottom in ommatidium size. In the relatively well studied C. megacephala, the evolution of the derived form was associated with the development of a widespread and successful pest. Because little is known about the habits of the other dimorphic Chrysomya spp., we examined the collection information for the dimorphic C. pinguis (Walker) from 8 Asian countries. The ecological information, albeit limited, suggests that the derived form of C. pinguis is more widespread and synanthropic than the normal form.

N2  - The development of the Oriental latrine fly, Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius), was examined at 27℃ in order to resolve discrepancies in previous reports. Various developmental events were completed by all larvae by the following ages : egg hatch, 18hr; first molt, 30hr; second molt, 72hr; pupariation, 144hr; adult emergence, 234hr. Differing descriptions of C. megacephala development appear to reflect variation in the length of the postfeeding period, during which time larvae may be particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. By sampling entire age cohorts, we were able to construct confidence bands about growth curves based on body length and dry weight. This allows the first measure of precision for estimates of larval age based on laboratory growth data.

N2  - From 1988 to 1993,we studied anti-invading methods against the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha mista, in houses at several locations in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, where a great number of the bugs in overwintering flight has been observed every year. The "slit-trap" was proved to be effective as an attractant for the bugs. When several traps were set around a building, the number of invading bugs into the building apparently decreased. The application of concentrated cyphenothrin and the laying of a cyphenothrin-treated polyethylene sheet to window-frames were also effective to prevent the invasion of the bugs. These preventive measures were almost 100% effective in reinforced concrete buildings such as modern hotels, whereas the number of invading bugs to wooden houses only slightly decreased. Covering wooden houses with cyphenothrin-treated nets was effective to prevent the invasion of the bugs. The application of repellent (Deet) to window-frames was also effective.

N2  - In this study a simulation model of the population dynamics of Culex tritaeniorhynchus (TriDyn) was developed using the dynamic life table approach. The model took account of the density dependent effects on larval mortalities. A density independent factor reflecting the seasonal variation of survival rates of immatures and females as well as fecundity of females is described using a sinusoid function. The simulation demonstrated the significant role of the density dependent effect in the dynamics of Culex tritaeniorhynchus populations, suggesting that the bimodal and fluctuating population dynamics observed in light trap samples in Shanghai may have resulted from an overcompensation of density dependent processes.

N2  - Field study in Hachijo Island, Tokyo, showed Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven was short-day univoltine insect whose development continued for 6 months (December to May). Adults appeared from November to June in towns (alt. 50m) and from October to July in the montane moss forests of Mt. Hachijo-Fuji (alt. 850m). The number of flies at the upland gradually increased during February to April and then decreased. After the rainy season in June, no adults were trapped throughout summer in both lowlands and uplands. No developing stages were also observed from June to November in both habitats. The first appearance of aged males and females in moss forests in October, suggests that adults aestivate there. After aestivation some females migrate from uplands to lowlands for spawning eggs. The lowland population emerged in spring migrates to uplands for aestivation. This up- and down seasonal migration was confirmed by the release and recapture of marked flies in the field experiment made during the same period. Adults seem to escape from lowlands in order to maintain diapause.

N2  - In order to compare the cold hardiness of the two ticks, I. nipponensis and I. persulcatus, the survival of each stage of both species was observed at 25℃ after exposure to low temperatures (4,-2,and -5℃) for 10-50 days. Both in I. nipponensis and in I. persulcatus, the egg hatchability was low (0-62.3%) when the eggs were exposed to 4 or -2℃ for 10-50 days. None of the unfed larvae of either species died with exposure to -2℃ for 10 days. After exposure to -2℃ for 30-50 days or -5℃ for 10-50 days, however, the survival rate of the unfed larvae became lower in I. nipponensis than in I. persulcatus. The molting percentage of engorged larvae of both species was high (76.7-93.3%) when they were exposed to 4℃ for 10-50 days. After exposure to -2℃ for 20-50 days or -5℃ for 20-30 days, however, the molting percentage of engorged I. nipponensis larvae became lower than that of engorged I. persulcatus ones. The survival rate of unfed nymphs of both species was high (72.1-100%) even after exposure to -5℃ for 10-50 days. The engorged nymphs of both species successfully molted (61.9-100%) with exposure to 4 or -2℃ for 10-50 days. After exposure to -5℃ for 10-30 days, however, engorged I. nipponensis nymphs were more seriously impaired than the engorged I. persulcatus nymphs. The high tolerance of I. persulcatus to low temperatures explains why this tick can survive in the upper montane to subalpine zones of the Chichibu Mountains. However, the reasons why the distribution of I. nipponensis is limited in the lower montane zone can not be fully explained by the present results because of the high tolerance of the unfed nymphs to low temperatures.

N2  - Mite surveys were conducted in living rooms and bedrooms of 21 wooden houses in and around Nagoya City, from September 1983 to June 1984 at about 3-month intervals. Multiple regression analysis was applied to elucidate the influence of housing conditions on the prevalence of mites. The results revealed that the annual mean densities of Dermatophagoides farinae and the total mites were positively correlated with the number of rooms and type of flooring and inversely with family size. The estimated densities of these mites showed good agreement with the observed densities. While no significant factor was detected for the densities of D. pteronyssinus and Cheyletidae, major factors detected for the prevalence of Haplochthonius simplex and Tarsonemidae were the number of rooms, family size, and air conditioning; for the latter mites, type of bedding was also a factor. Major factors for Glycyphagidae were family size, working housewife, age of house and type of heater. Factors for Cosmochthonius reticulatus were the number of rooms, working housewife, age of house and house-cleaning frequency. For Acaridae, family size, working housewife and type of flooring were factors. The number of mite species had positive correlation with the number of rooms and working housewife, and negative correlation with house-cleaning frequency and type of flooring, whereas Simpson's indexes of diversity were negatively correlated with the number of rooms, house-cleaning frequency, and type of flooring. These results indicated that both the number of rooms and family size were the most important factors associated with the prevalence of domestic mites in wooden houses, followed by type of flooring, working housewife, house-cleaning frequency, etc. The difference in the prevalence was considered to be mostly due to the interrelationship between the biological characteristics of mites, especially their humidity requirements and the degree of dampness in houses largely influenced by household activities and dwelling spaces.

N2  - To evaluate the joint toxic action of two pyrethroids, d-allethrin was mixed with one of five pyrethroids : permethrin, phenothrin, d-resmethrin, cyphenothrin and prallethrin. Five mixtures each containing two pyrethroids were tested against the cat flea by the film contact method. In analyzing the results, the graphical analysis by the alternative method proposed by Sakai et al. (1951) and the co-toxicity coefficient of the mixture as defined by Sun and Johnson (1960) were fitted to the experimental data. Out of the five combinations, the mixtures of d-allethrin and phenothrin showed high synergistic action. The mixtures of d-allethrin and cyphenothrin, and d-allethrin and permethrin followed. Two mixtures, d-allethrin and d-resmethrin and, d-allethrin and prallethrin, exhibited only low synergism.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Nagasaki Prefecture were investigated from collections of larval and pupal stages of blackflies from streams in 30 localities in February 1993. A total number of 5,025 blackflies, 4,377 larvae (87.1%) and 648 pupae (12.9%) were collected at 30 sites. Those blackflies were classified into one genus and 13 species but one of them was unidentified. Three species, Simulium (Nevermannia) subcostatum, S. (E.) sp. H and S. (Simulium) suzukii were newly recorded from Nagasaki Prefecture. The predominant species was S. (S.) arakawae (44.6% in total number), followed by S. (N.) uchidai (28.6%), S. (Odagmia) aokii (11.8%) and S. (Gnus) bidentatum (7.3%). The most widely distributed species was S. (N.) uchidai (26 sites), followed by S. (S.) arakawae (21 sites), S. (Gn.) bidentatum (12 sites) and S. (S.) japonicum (8 sites). The species most widely distributed from lowland to highland areas were S. (N.) uchidai, followed by S. (S.) arakawae, S. (Gn.) bidentatum, S. (S.) japonicum, S. (O.) aokii and S. (S.) rufibasis.

N2  - To determine the resting height of Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann on vegetation, we collected ticks on vegetation along a mountain path in the southern part of Chiba Prefecture and measured the vertical height (VH) and the length from the root (LR) of resting positions on the plants. The mean VH and LR, respectively, were 51.7 and 46.9cm in nymphs, 38.4 and 41.3cm in adults, and 35.0 and 39.1cm in larvae. In this area, the values of VH and LR in larvae were larger than those reported in other areas, and adults were found at a lower height. This is probably ascribable to their main host being deer, Cervus nippon Temminck, in this area. The difference in VH and LR was small because more ticks were collected from the vegetation on a flat place than on slopes along the mountain path. The plants on which we found ticks belonged to 12 species, but there were no favored plants for resting of the ticks.

N2  - Improved methods for isolation of bacteria from apparently healthy mosquitoes and for demonstration of bacterial hemolysin production are precisely described. Several hemolytic bacteria were isolated from blood-fed mosquitoes, Aedes vexans nipponii and Aedes albopictus. Among them Bacillus spp. were the predominant in Ae. vexans nipponii. No Bacillus sp. was isolated from Ae. albopictus. No hemolytic bacteria except one strain of Serratia marcescens was isolated from Ae. albopictus concomitantly captured with Ae. vexans nipponii. Bacillus spp. isolated from Ae. vexans nipponii were found to produce hemolysins which exert hemolytic activity on rabbit, sheep and mouse erythrocytes. The molecular weights of these hemolysins were instantly estimated in situ on a slab for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). These bacilli might be indigenous bacteria to mosquitoes rather than transient contaminants although the number of isolated bacilli was small.

N2  - We examined the susceptibility of 4 species of adult house-invading bugs, Halyomorpha mista, Menida scotti, Lygaeus equestris and Urochela quadrinotata, to seven insecticides including three pyrethroides (cyphenothrin, phenothrin, permethrin), three organophosphates (fenthion, fenitrothion, diazinon) and one carbamate (propoxur) by contact methods. The tested pyrethroides were effective against all bug species. Especially, cyphenothrin was superior to the other chemicals both in fast-acting property and residual activity. Propoxur also showed considerable fastacting property and residual activity. On the other hand, organophosphates had little insecticidal activity under these experimental conditions.

N2  - Inhibitory effects of two JHAs, pyriproxyfen and methoprene, on embryonic and larval development of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, were determined by laboratory test. The inhibitory effects of the JHA on cocoon formation and larval-adult development when incorporated into the larval-rearing media of 1- to 3-day-old larvae were investigated. The IC_<50> values of pyriproxyfen were 0.0056ppm for cocoon formation and 0.00017ppm for larval-adult development, while the IC_<50> values of methoprene were 0.014 and 0.00032ppm, respectively. The ovicidal effects were observed when flea eggs within 24-hr-old were exposed continuously on filter paper treated with pyriproxyfen or methoprene, showing that the ID_<50> were 0.045 and 0.182μg/(cm)^2,respectively. Adult fleas were exposed to pyriproxyfen, then fed on a cat to investigate the ovicidal effect on flea eggs. The egg hatching was inhibited immediately. The partial inhibition (more than 50% inhibition) of egg hatching lasted for six days after treatment. The inhibitory effects of pyriproxyfen on egg hatching when treated on the fur of cats at dosages of 4 and 12mg per cat were investigated. The treatment at the lower dosage completely inhibited the egg hatching for 11 days and at the higher dosage for 18 days. In the latter case, the percentage of hatching was considerably less than that of the control throughout the 2 months after treatment.

N2  - Cockroaches inhabiting in an underground shopping arcade in Osaka were investigated by using bait traps, and their susceptibility to insecticides were assessed by a topical application method. In the underground arcade, dominant species were Blattella germanica and Periplaneta brunnea accompanied by a small number of P. fuliginosa. The average number captured in the restaurant area of the arcade was almost equivalent between the dominant two species (1-2 roaches/(day・trap)). While B. germanica was dominant at cafe restaurants and Western style restaurants, P. brunnea was major at Japanese restaurants, Japanese pubs and sushi shops. The similar habitat preference was observed in the food store area, which had continuous floor and constant temperature and humidity among the shops. This habitat segregation has been basically unchanged during the 10 years of monitoring. It is supposed that one of the reasons of the habitat preference is originated from some difference of chemical factors in the food or food materials. In B. germanica, LD_<50> values for fenitrothion, pyrethrins and d-trans-permethrin had a tendency to increase gradually during the 10 years. All the final R/S ratio, however, still belonged to a low level. Against the P. brunnea, while LD_<50> value for fenitrothion was almost constant throughout the monitoring period, those for the two pyrethroids increased and, especially for d-trans-permethrin, the final resistance level was supposed to be of a moderate rank. According to these results, the current spray program in this field, multiple application of organophosphates (e.g. fenitrothion) and pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin), is considered an effective measure to suppress the population density of B. germanica as well as to prevent the development of their high resistance to insecticides. Against P. brunnea, however, it is suggested that successive monitoring studies should be necessary to watch the effectiveness of insecticides, particularly for synthetic pyrethroids.

The following 8 species of mosquito larvae were identified : Tripteroides bambusa, Uranotaenia novobscura, Aedes japonicus, Ae. albopictus, Armigeres subalbatus, Culex kyotoensis, Orthopodomyia anopheloides and Ae. nipponicus. A variance test for species association suggested a strong negative association among tree hole mosquitoes. The relationship between tree hole properties and community structure was analyzed to discover what type of tree holes is most commonly occupied by Ae. albopictus and other mosquitoes. Two groups of tree holes were identified by comparing species composition among tree holes based on the Trellis diagram. Comparison of the incidence of tree hole mosquitoes and the physical properties of tree holes in the 2 groups suggested that "open-type" and drought-resisting tree holes having the following properties are most preferable for Ae. albopictus : the hole was top-opening, large in volume and in size of the opening and the surface of standing water was easily detected from the above.

N2  - Engorged larvae of Leptotrombidium scutellare, the vector mite of scrub typhus in Japan, were reared by feeding them with fresh eggs of the collembolan Sinella curviseta in small plastic containers under field conditions. The larvae collected from wild rodents (Apodemus speciosus) in autumn 1988 developed into protonymphs before winter, became dormant in the winter and started to develop in the spring. Thus, the development of engorged larvae reared from April became synchronized with that of larvae obtained in the autumn. Most protonymphs developed into deutonymphs in May, tritonymphs in June and adults in July. Adults were kept alive for about 2 years. The engorged larvae reared from summer developed into deutonymphs, tritonymphs or adults before winter, and then became dormant in the winter. Development re-started from the next spring, and all became adult by summer, when the females laid eggs. Out of 40 females reared individually, 10 females laid eggs in two consecutive summers. The average number of eggs (63.3) per female in the first summer was more than that of the following summer (43.7). Hatchability also decreased in the second summer. Females laid eggs in summer, and unfed larvae hatched beginning in early October. The larvae showed only a peak in autumn, although some of them were still alive the following spring with a survival period of 5 months.

N2  - Insecticide susceptibility of a Sakai (Osaka) strain of adults of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, was evaluated using 26 chemicals after colonization for 6 months. Cat fleas were reared on domestic cats by the method described by Hudson and Prince (1958). The following results were obtained. 1. According to the experiments for the influence of elapsed time after adult-emergence, insecticide susceptibility remained almost unchanged in the individuals upto 3 days old, then it rose rapidly 7-8 days after emergence. 2. The effects of six insecticides on the cat flea were compared by exposing adults to insecticide residues of different dosage for limited times. The higher mortalities tended to occur with longer contact times. Generally, the ratios (LC_<50> for 1hr contact/LC_<50> for 24hr contact) based on the LC_<50>'s of pyrethroids between the 1hr and 24hr contact were greater than those of organophosphates. 3. Toxicity (μg/(cm)^2) based on the LC_<50>'s were determined by the successive contact method. Dichlorvos and fenthion were most toxic against the cat flea. Other insecticides tested, in descending order of toxicity, were chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion, diazinon, propoxur, fenobucarb, carbaryl, metoxadiazone, cyfluthrin, empenthrin, trichlorfon, resmethrin and prallethrin. 4. The data of insecticide susceptibility of the cat flea presented here were compared with those reported by several workers from various localities in USA. The Sakai strain was more susceptible to pyrethroids and carbamates, while more tolerant to organophosphates, as compared with a susceptible (California) strain.

N2  - The following information was obtained after feeding a warfarin-resistant colony (RR : 50%) of Rattus rattus with bait containing various concentrations of warfarin or diphacinone. 1. High lethal effect was obtained in a comparatively short period by higher concentrations of warfarin, 0.25 or 0.5%, though the rats are resistant to 0.025% warfarin bait. 2. The warfarin-resistant colony showed cross resistance to diphacinone. 3. The log day-probit mortality curve of the colony after feeding with 0.005% diphacinone formed a curve with one plateau. The RR ratio to diphacinone was estimated from the plateau to be around 25%, which was lower than the RR ratio to warfarin (50%). 4. The rats given diphacinone bait of higher concentrations, 0.015 or 0.025%, all died in a comparatively short period, thus showing no resistance to diphacinone. 5. The potency of bait with 0.025% warfarin seemed equivalent to that of bait with 0.005% diphacinone.

N2  - A long-term population growth of Aedes albopictus was examined by the population cage method for 350 days using two laboratory strains originated from Nagasaki, Japan and Chiangmai, Thailand. The populations were allowed to increase under two different conditions of larval food (poor and rich). Temporal changes in age composition and densities of larvae and adults were examined weekly. When the food condition of larvae was poor, none of the populations could survive : the population of Nagasaki strain became extinct at 214 days after the introduction of the initial population and two populations of Chiangmai strain became extinct at 49 and 70 days, respectively. The populations of both strains reproducing under the condition of rich larval food repeated an increase and decrease cycle throughout the experiment, and marked differences in several population parameters were observed between the two strains. The population of Nagasaki strain showed a higher rate of population increase, achieved higher densities of larvae and adults, and produced smaller females having longer longevity and higher fecundity.

N2  - The host-feeding activities of unfed Ixodes nipponensis nymphs exposed to short-day photoperiods (10L-14D and 12L-12D) under constant temperature (25℃) were observed at three different ages (within a month, 3,and 5 or more months after molting). The rates of engorgement (quantitative value of the host-feeding activity) of nymphs exposed to 10L-14D and 12L-12D were only 2.0 and 10.1%, respectively, when the nymphs attached to hosts at the age within a month after molting. However, the rates of the nymphal engorgement became higher with the lapse of time after molting. At the age of 5 or more months after molting, the rates of engorgement of nymphs exposed to 10L-14D and 12L-12D were 43.6 and 59.2%, respectively. These results suggest that the diapause of unfed I. nipponensis nymphs induced by exposure to shortday photoperiod weakens with the time elapsed after molting.

The LC_<50> values of malathion (and resistance ratio as compared with a susceptible strain of Ogasawara Is.) in these strains were high, ranging from 0.111ppm (resistance ratio : 7.4) in the Ishigakijima strain to 1.838ppm (122.5) in the Miyakojima strain. These strains were, however, susceptible to the other ten insecticides, viz. p, p'-DDT, seven organophosphates, propoxur (a carbamate) and permethrin (a pyrethroid).

N2  - Flies emerging from six kinds of breeding media, namely, fresh bananas, mixed vegetables, fermented oil cake, fermented fowl droppings, dog feces and minced pork were investigated in the urban and suburban areas of Tokyo from March to October, 1992. As a result of the survey, 51 species belonging to 12 families were obtained throughout the period. It was confirmed that there are distinct differences among the 6 kinds of breeding media and the bred species. The flies obtained were separated into 6 groups and 18 subgroups according to the breeding medium. The flies which emerged from bananas belonged mainly to Drosophilidae. They were also bred from mixed vegetables, however, the species composition was different from that of the banana-bred flies. Two species of drosophilid flies, Drosophila coracina and D. rufa, were bred from fermented oil cake and fermented fowl droppings in addition to mixed vegetables. They also breed from fungi in natural environment. It is supposed that the feeding range of those species is wide and adaptable to various breeding media, and their breeding habits are spread from fungivorous to saprophytophagous. Lasiomma meadei, Paralimosina japonica and Anthomyia illocata bred from feces or droppings in the urban habitat. These three species were dominant in this survey. On the contrary, Musca domestica and Fannia canicularis which are the most hygienically important species were not obtained from any of the breeding media. The flies which bred from oil cake consisted of 9 families and 27 species, namely, coprophagous and saprophagous species. Judging from the results, the oil cake is a very important breeding medium, because it is used as fertilizer in kitchen gardens or floriculture. The dominant species which bred from minced pork was Parasarcophaga similis.

N2  - From 1988 through 1992 we studied the overwintering number of brown-marmorated stink bugs (Halyomorpha mista), at Unazuki Spa Town in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, where the overwintering flight of Halyomorpha mista has been observed every year. The flight of H. mista to the wall surface of buildings starts usually at the end of September and reaches a peak around the 3rd week of October. The coming-fly of bugs ceases at the end of November. The flight of stink bugs started in the daytime when the maximum temperature reached nearly 25℃ after overnight minimum temperature of about 15℃; the maximum number of bugs was recorded on an autumn day after the minimum temperature fell below 10℃. Regarding the slit traps which were set on the building roofs, more bugs were attracted to the slit traps which faced riverside than to those which faced the mountains. The natural wood-color board (coated with clear lacquer) attracted more bugs than boards painted in black or white. The bugs attached to the slit traps were observed 1 or 2 weeks after the onset of their flying to the wall surface of buildings.

N2  - The effect of male sterilant α-chlorohydrin, microencapsulated with polystyrene, nylon 6-10,calcium alginate wall material, on bait acceptance by wild male norway rats was researched along with its antifertility effect. Compared with the basal diet, rat appetite diminished by 80% with 1% dose of non-encapsulated α-chlorohydrin, while with 2% dose the bait was rejected. But with microencapsulated α-chlorohydrin, bait acceptance was fairly good at 2% dose, particularly with calcium alginate wall material. In this case, the amount eaten was nearly equivalent to 75% of the amount eaten in the basal diet. After the treatment, the rats were paired with nontreated females for 60 days. The females paired with males which had taken α-chlorohydrin did not reproduce while non-treated pairs reproduced twice during the period. The results suggest that microencapsulation of α-chlorohydrin promotes bait acceptance and also has an antifertility effect on male rats.

N2  - Leptotrombidium akamushi (♀) and L. deliense (♂) produced the F_1 generation (F_<1ad>), from which the F_2 generation (F_<2ad>) was successfully obtained. This indicates a close genetical relationship between the two species. L. akamushi (♀) and L. fletcheri (♂) also produced the hybrids (F_<1af>), but no F_2 eggs were obtained. Hybridization between L. deliense and L. fletcheri was not successful, indicating their independency as species. The arrangement of setae was observed and standard scutal measurements were taken in these 3 species and the hybrids. The hybrids showed the same setal arrangement as their parents in F_<1ad> and F_<2ad>, or an intermediate pattern in F_<1af>. The scutal measurements showed that the F_<1ad> shared characteristics of the parents and that F_<1af> and F_<2ad> were very similar to L. deliense.

N2  - Detection of specific antigens in the extracts of Culex tritaeniorhynchus (abbr. Ct) was attempted, with the aim of determining natural predators of Ct by an immunological method through electrosyneresis (ES method). According to the ES method, both antisera prepared against the extracts of the 4th-instar larvae and adults of Ct caused precipitation with immunogen upto 2,048 fold dilution. These antisera contained antibodies cross-reactive to the extracts of the larvae and adults of Anopheles sinensis (abbr. As). Anti-Ct antisera after absorption by As extracts showed no cross-reactivity to As extract nor to the extracts of 22 species of arthropods inhabiting rice fields. Absorbed anti-Ct antisera reacted only with the extracts of larvae and adults of Ct, and immunoelectrophoresis with these antisera detected multiple specific antigenic components. By the ES method with absorbed anti-Ct antisera, the body constituents of Ct were detected from the nymphs of Pantala flavescens (Odonata : Libellulidae), the larvae of Hydaticus sp. (Coleoptera : Dytiscidae) and Hydrochara sp. (Coleoptera : Hydrophilidae) 24hr after feeding on a single 4th-instar larva of Ct and from the adults of Lycosa pseudoannulata (Araneae : Lycosidae) and Tetragnatha vermiformis (Araneae : Tetragnathidae) 24hr after feeding on a single adult female of Ct.

N2  - A nonlethal strain of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi was separated from chiggers, Leptotrombidium pallidum. Experimental infection with a nonlethal strain, as well as with a lethal strain, induced protection against the lethal strain of rickettsia (Gilliam) in mice. Serum antibody titer was not augmented by the challenge infection in any case. Antibodies are probably less important in protection against the challenged rickettsiae.

N2  - To examine the effect of the photoperiod on the host-seeking activity and development of I. nipponensis, the larvae and nymphs were exposed to three photoperiodic conditions (10L-14D, 12L-12D and 16L-8D) at 25℃. The host-seeking activity of unfed larvae was slightly suppressed by exposure to short-day photoperiods (10L-14D or 12L-12D) during the stages from eggs to unfed larvae. The host-seeking activity of unfed nymphs was strongly suppressed by exposure to short-day photoperiod during the stages from engorged larvae to unfed nymphs. The development of engorged larvae was little affected by the photoperiodic conditions before, during and after engorgement, although some of them entered diapause (lack of molting on 50 days after detachment) when they were reared at 10L-14D before, during and after engorgement. However, the developmental period of engorged nymphs was prolonged by exposure to short-day photoperiod. Diapause (lack of molting on 60 days after engorgement) occurred in engorged nymphs from the 10L or 12L groups reared at 10L-14D or 12L-12D during and after engorgement. Engorged nymphs from the 16L group did not enter diapause irrespective of the photoperiodic condition during and after engorgement. The diapause of unfed nymphs synchronizes nymphal activity with the favourable seasons of spring to summer. However, the diapause of the engorged nymphs has no effect on the activity of I. nipponensis because the nymphs disappear in the short days of autumn.

N2  - The susceptibility of Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. boninensis in Ogasawara Is. to eleven insecticides was tested in 1990. For Ae. albopictus, the LC_<50> value of p, p'-DDT was 0.037ppm, malathion 0.107ppm, fenitrothion 0.013ppm, propoxur 2.831ppm, and permethrin 0.0096ppm. For Cx. quinquefasciatus, the LC_<50> values of p, p'-DDT was 1.201ppm, malathion 0.071ppm, fenitrothion 0.014ppm, propoxur 1.617ppm, and permethrin 0.016ppm. For Cx. boninensis, an endemic species of Ogasawara Is., the LC_<50> value of p, p'-DDT was 0.012ppm, malathion 0.021ppm, fenitrothion 0.0096ppm, propoxur 0.6221ppm, and permethrin 0.0054ppm. Culex boninensis is susceptible to all the insecticides tested and the LC_<50> values of nearly all the insecticides were lower than those for Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Kyoto Prefecture were investigated from collections of larvae and pupae stages of blackflies from streams and adults flying around the collection sites in 49 localities in August 1987. A total number of 4,612 blackflies, 3,852 larvae, 751 pupae and 9 adults, was collected at 42 sites. Those blackflies were classified into one genus and 17 species but one of them was unidentified. Two species, Simulium (Simulium) quinquestriatum and S. (Gnus) daisense were newly recorded from Kyoto Prefecture. The predominant species was S. (Nevermannia) uchidai (18.9% in total number), followed by S. (G.) bidentatum (15.9%), S. (S.) japonicum (14.8%) and S. (S.) quinquestriatum (11.2%). The most widely distributed species was S. (N.) uchidai, followed by S. (G.) bidentatum, S. (Gomphostilbia) shogakii and S. (S.) arakawae.

The causative tick species were identified as Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899 (nymph and adult female, Cases 1 and 5), Haemaphysalis flava Neumann, 1897 (adult female, Cases 2 and 4) and Ixodes nipponensis Kitaoka and Saito, 1967 (adult female, Case 3) based on morphology of capitulum, coxae, internal spurs, spiracular plates and genital aperture. The tick bites were thought to have been occurred in hilly areas in Cases 1 and 3,in a vegetable garden and on a grassy plain in Cases 2 and 5,the place of bite acquisition could not be traced in Case 4. The present report covers the 14th to 18th cases of hard tick infestation in Okayama Prefecture, Japan.

N2  - A questionnaire was carried out to investigate the spread of head louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) among kindergarteners and schoolchildren in Okayama City in 1992. Thirty-one percent of the institutions had lice-infected children. A total of 591 children (1%), 90% of whom were girls was infected with head lice. Children in the lower grades of elementary schools showed the highest infection rate. The head lice were prevalent in Okayama all year around, particularly in June and November.

N2  - Insecticidal activity of the feces excreted from hydramethylnon bait-fed cockroaches was evaluated in three species and four strains of cockroaches indigenous to Japan. Cockroaches used for the test were the Yoken, Ohsaka, Shibuya and Toshima strains of Blattela germanica, Periplaneta americana and P. fuliginosa. Hydramethylnon-contained bait, male adult cockroaches, water and harborage were placed in plastic cups. Three or 4 days later when all the male cockroaches had died, the dead insects and hydramethylnon-contained bait were removed, and the feces were left in the cups. Then 1-2 instar nymphs, male and female adult cockroaches and untreated rat food were placed in each cup. As a control group, food was placed instead of hydramethylnon-contained bait, i. e., male adult cockroaches, untreated rat food, water and harborage were placed in plastic cups. Corrected cumulative mortality for each test group was calculated by the Abott method and compared with the cumulative mortality of control group. Corrected cumulative mortality of the Yoken strain of B. germanica for the experimental period of 18 days were 82.5% for adult males, 65.0% for adult females and 48.6% for 1-2 instar nymphs. Among the other field-captured strains, corrected cumulative mortality for adult females in the Shibuya strain, 1-2 instar nymphs in both the Ohsaka and Toshima strains were higher than that for the corresponding stage and/or sex in the Yoken strain. Corrected cumulative mortality of P. americana for the experimental period of 29 days were 78.7% for adult males, 7.6% for adult females and 70.9% for 1-2 instar nymphs. Corrected cumulative mortality of P. fuliginosa for the experimental period of 29 days were 23.4% for adult males, 50.0% for adult females and 76.7% for 1-2 instar nymphs. Although the mortality for adult females P. americana was low, our results demonstrated that hydramethylnon has a secondary kill effect for B. germanica, P. americana and P. fuliginosa through the feces excreted by hydramethylnon-fed cockroaches.

N2  - Using six populations of roof rats, Rattus rattus, captured in various parts of Japan, the lethal feeding period (LFP) of warfarin was studied by feeding 0.025% bait. On recognizing Amami, Ogasawara and Ikebukuro-B populations as susceptible, the standard susceptible LFP-line was established by combining the data of the three populations. The Tako population with the resistance ratio 1.5 was suspected to include some resistant gene. The Shinjuku population, which was confirmed as a mixed population of RR, RS and SS in the previous study (Tanikawa, 1992), was reconfirmed as highly resistant, because of its high resistance ratio (28.5) and also based on other aspects. The Ikebukuro-A population was concluded to be intermediately resistant. As the death of rats due to bait-feeding occurred usually within 5 days of the last feeding, the observation period after bait-feeding could be only 10 days at the longest. Proposed here is a tentative plan for susceptibility surveillance of field-captured roof rats, using the LFP-line established herewith. That is : 1) to feed the rats with 0.025% warfarin bait for 12 days in separate cages, 2) to feed them with unpoisoned bait for 10 days afterward, in case mortality on the 12th day is not less than 50%, and categorize them as a pure susceptible population with only SS gene, if mortality at the end of the test is more than 80%, 3) to feed them with warfarin bait till the 28th day, in case mortality on the 12th day is less than 50%, and categorize the survived individuals, if any, as those with RR gene, 4) to classify them as a population with a resistant gene to some extent, if the mortality is between the above two categories.

N2  - In order to control the adult midges, Tokunagayusurika akamusi, the present study was made on the efficient capture of adult midges using ten electric collecting-killing insect traps with BL (black light)-lamps in the field. The traps captured 13,006±11,834 (mean±S.D.) ind./day on average. The number of midges per trap tended to decrease with the number of lit traps but increased with the number of lit BL-lamps. When the traps with four BL-lamps were placed at 20-30m intervals, the most economical and effective capture was obtained. However, huge numbers of adult midges were attracted, stuck to and completely covered the electric grid of the trap, thereby causing the capture efficiency to deteriorate.

N2  - Comparative study on venomous components extracted from the venom sacs of Japanese hornets, V. dybowskii, V. simillima and V. crabro, was achieved by the pattern analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography. Proteinous components in the venom sac of V. dybowskii were electrophoretically different in the range of 2.5 to 205 kDa from those of V. simillima and V. crabro. In contrast, profiles of proteinous components in the venom sacs of both V. simillima and V. crabro showed a high homology. Biogenic amines such as histamine, serotonin, putrescine, and spermidine were observed as common components in three kinds of Vespa venoms. On the other hand, large amounts of putrescine and serotonin were contained in V. dybowskii venom compared with those in the other venoms. Mastoparans and Ves-CPs, which are common active peptides found in Vespa venoms, were observed in the venoms of V. simillima or V. crabro but were not detected in V. dybowskii venom.

N2  - From 19 species of birds captured at the various localities in Japan, 5 species of Ixodes ticks and 4 species of Haemaphysalis ticks were documented. All stages of the bird-feeding I. turdus were found to be infected with spirochetes. The field study in Nemuro, Hokkaido, demonstrated that the immature I. persulcatus feeding on 2 species of birds, Emberiza spodocephala and Turdus chrysolaus, were highly infected with spirochetes. Two spirochetal isolates derived from the bird-feeding larvae of I. persulcatus were found to be quite similar to the JEM1 isolate from a patient of Lyme disease on comparison of their constituent protein profiles. These data strongly suggest that the birds are reservoirs for the Lyme disease spirochetes.

N2  - Investigations on fauna and the seasonal fluctuation of larval trombiculid mites were carried out at a young natural laurel forest and a planted pine forest, for over 3 and 2 years, respectively, in northern Kyushu. At the laurel forest, 15 species were collected from small mammals, and an additional 5 species were obtained from the soil. Many species occurred from mid-autumn to late spring or early summer. However, each species showed a different specific pattern of fluctuation. Leptotrombidium miyairii occurred throughout the year without any peak. Like L. miyairii, some whitish species appeared over long periods. On the other hand, some reddish species occurred for short periods. From these facts, it was conjectured that the larvae of species dwelling in the soil or burrows occur for longer periods than ground surface dwellers. At the pine forest, only 3 species were collected. L. pallidum, a vector species of tsutsugamushi disease, occurred from October to April, with one peak in winter.

N2  - A 1% (AI) chlorpyrifos termiticide foam was applied beneath concrete slabs through holes spaced 30 and 45cm apart, and 10,and 20cm from a wall. Application was made to slabs with no void between the underside of the concrete and the top of the gravel fill, and to slabs with a 4cm void between the concrete and gravel. Foam was applied at the rate of 15 liters/3 linear m with a straight-tip nozzle. After 24hr 5g samples of the top 2.5cm of soil were taken from four locations : directly beneath the application hole, at the wall in front of the application hole, equal distance between two application holes, and at the wall, equal distance between two application holes. A continuous band of insecticide-treated soil resulted from the foam application using the three hole spacings. There was no significant difference in the amount of chlorpyrifos in the soil at the four sampling locations for the three hole spacings, and for slabs with and without a void beneath the slab.

N2  - In Hokkaido, species composition and seasonal fluctuation of house-invading activity of stink bugs were studied during 1991 and 1992 seasons in an elementary school into which stink bugs have entered for hibernation in large numbers every year. Among 41,393 individuals belonging to 14 species collected, Menida scotti was predominant occupying more than 80% of the total collected specimens followed by Urochela quadrinotata and Lygaeus equestris. They are a serious nuisance in this elementary school. Their house-invading activities began in September and terminated in November. L. equestris was the earliest appearance species and most abundant in September. M. scotti was collected in and around the school building from late September to mid-November. The highest flight activity of this species was observed on several days in mid-October during which the weather was fine or cloudy and the maximum temperature of each day was approximately 15℃. Urochela quadrinotata was the latest appearance species with peak activity in late October. The slit trap used for collecting Halyomorpha mista, an important nuisance stink bug in Honshu, was not applicable for the species abundant here.

N2  - Larvicide efficacy of insect growth regulators (pyriproxyfen, methoprene and diflubenzuron), in comparison with the larvicidal and adulticidal efficacy of conventional insecticides, against several species of Anopheline mosquitoes including several insecticide resistant strains were evaluated in laboratory conditions. In all species, no cross resistance between IGRs and the other kinds of insecticides, such as organophosphate, organochlorine, carbamate and pyrethroid, was observed. Relative effectiveness of pyriproxyfen to methoprene ranged from several to 40 times and that to diflubenzuron ranged from 19.5 times to more than 400 times.

N2  - The features of acoustic response and wingbeat frequency of a chironomid midge, Chironomus yoshimatsui were studied. The swarms observed were formed above the ground close by cherry trees. The swarming males were mainly caught by cylindrical sound traps emitting sound frequencies of 180-270Hz at between 9 and 15℃ and of 300-390Hz at between 20 and 28℃ during the experimental period in a field. However, the swarming male responded to a fairly narrow range of sound frequency at an ambient air temperature. Accordingly, there was a good correlation between the air temperature and the sound frequency of the highest male catch. The sound frequency of the highest male catch changed at the rate of 10Hz/℃. The mean wingbeat frequencies of both sexes were almost at constant levels from the first day of emergence to the 4-day-old after emergence. The male wingbeat frequency was always higher than that of the female at the same air temperature. There was a good correlation between the air temperature and the wingbeat frequency of each adult day in both sexes. The wingbeat frequencies of male and female changed at the rate of 18-21 and 10-12Hz/℃, respectively. When the regression line of the female wingbeat frequency on the air temperature of each adult day is compared with that of the sound frequency of the highest male catch on the air temperature, the former is consistent with the latter statistically. This indicates that swarming male has the hearing faculty to be accurately tuned to the wingbeat frequency of conspecific female which is variable with the ambient air temperature.

N2  - Following the studies on the chironomids collected in Kamikochi and Asama-Onsen areas carried out in May 1990 and published by Sasa and Hirabayashi (1991), more extensive collections of the chironomids were conducted by the same workers in May 1991 in the same areas, and 27 species (including 12 new species) were recorded from Kamikochi, and 20 species (including 5 new species) were recorded from the latter, making 30 species from the former area and 29 species from the latter area in total. These results seem to represent chironomid fauna typical of a highland valley and a lowland valley of central Honshu.

N2  - The flies of the genus Potamia Robineau-Desvoidy are distributed in the Holarctic Region. Two species, P. littoralis (R.-D.) and P. setifemur (Stein), are known to occur in the Palaearctic Region (Soos, 1986). In Japan, however, there has been no record of this genus until now. During a survey on dipterous flies inhabiting birds' nests, we collected a muscid species bred from some nests. This species was identified to be Potamia littoralis Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830. In the present paper, we newly record this species from Japan and redescribe it on the basis of Japanese specimens.

The morphological characteristics of the chironomid larvae and pupae were almost identical with the description of Eurycnemus crassipes (Panzer) by Murry and Ashe (1981). The present observation appears to be the first report of the chironomid species which is parasitic on Trichoptera. Examination of the imago of Eurycnemus sp. is required before its specific name can be given.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies were investigated by collecting immature stages of flies from streams in 36 localities in Nara Prefecture in Nonvember, 1986. A total of 2,128 larvae and 500 pupae belonging to two genera, 17 species, were collected at the sites. The predominant species was Simulium (Simulium) japonicum (24.2%), followed by S. (S.) quinquestriatum (20.9%), Prosimulium (Prosimulium) kiotoense (13.6%), S. (Gnus) bidentatum (12.2%) and S. (Nevermannia) uchidai (10.4%). The most widely distributed species was S. (S.) japonicum (18 sites), followed by S. (Gn.) bidentatum (15 sites), S. (N.) uchidai (12 sites) and Pro. (Pro.) kiotoense (11 sites). The species most widely distributed from lowland areas to highland were S. (N.) uchidai and S. (S.) suzukii, followed by S. (S.) japonicum and S. (Gn.) bidentatum.

N2  - We investigated the environmental factors of scrub typhus prevailing from the early 1970s in a hilly area of western Kanagawa Prefecture. A total of 815 chiggers, Leptotrombidium scutellare, were collected mostly from the mouse Apodemus speciosus which accounted for 88% of 239 mammals captured in grass-scrub terrain dominated by Miscanthus sinensis. The chigger was found from 13 stations within about 25km from the western border to the east where there was no evidence of the chigger in the 1950s. Grass-scrub terrain is ideal habitat for both L. scutellare and A. speciosus. Grassscrub areas in four quadrats of 6(km)^2 each were estimated from aerial photographs taken in 1964,1973,1980 and 1985 around the foci. Total grass-scrub areas in the four quadrats increased from about 0.6(km)^2 in 1964 and 1973 to 1.5(km)^2 in 1985. The increase of the areas was due partly to deserted farmland. According to statistics by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan, deserted farmland in the major foci was expanded from 0.14(km)^2 in 1975 to 0.64(km)^2 in 1985. A cause of the epidemic of scrub typhus is the increase of L. scutellare along the expanded grass-scrub terrains.

N2  - The prevalence patterns of the house dust mites, Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) and D. pteronyssinus (Dp), in relation to temperature and relative humidity in the room were investigated at 9 residences located in Tokyo, Kanagawa and Toyama Prefectures. Mite prevalence peaked in the summer season between July and September in most rooms sampled, although a peak appeared in the winter season between December and February in a few rooms. The prevalence could be classified into 3 patterns of Df, Dp and intermediate pattern according to statistical significance in the dominancy of the numbers. When 2 or more rooms were investigated in 1 residence, there was a similarity of the pattern among them. The largest numbers of mites were observed at 60-70% RH in Df and 80-90% RH in Dp, and rising mean temperature resulted in the mite increasing in that month. According to the results analyzed by Spearman's rank correlation test, suitable temperature and relative humidity in the room were considered to be 22.5-32.5℃ and more than 45% RH for Df, and 17.5-32.5℃ and more than 75% RH for Dp, respectively, i. e. Df preferred relatively lower humidity while Dp preferred higher. These results suggest that rising temperature promotes an increase in the number of mites, while relative humidity affects the proportion of both species of mites.

Acute oral LD_<50> values of the test rats determined by single oral administration of some mixtures of warfarin and vitamin D_3 were shown as follows : warfarin+vitamin D_3 (1 : 4) : 4.3,17.0mg/kg; warfarin+vitamin D_3 (1 : 2) : 9.7,19.5mg/kg; and warfarin+vitamin D_3 (1 : 1) : 12.0,12.0mg/kg. On the other hand, acute oral LD_<50> values of warfarin and vitamin D_3 applied separately, were 61.1 and 44.7mg/kg, respectively. There was no significant difference between male and female in the acute toxicities of warfarin, vitamin D_3 and mixtures of the two. Synergistic effects between warfarin and vitamin D_3 were apparently observed in oral acute toxicities to rats.

N2  - The seasonal fluctuations of immature and adult I. persulcatus and adult I. ovatus were studied by flagging vegetation in the subalpine forests of Konashidaira and Sanjiro, Nagano Prefecture. The flaggings were conducted over the period from April to October. 1991,as well as, supplementally, the same period in 1992. The adult, nymph and larva of I. persulcatus showed a biannual fluctuation in number with a large peak from the end of May to the middle of June and a small one in the fall. The 1991 autumnal peak of the adult of I. persulcatus was so small that it was only represented by a single specimen per 100 sweepings. Adults of I. ovatus appeared during the time spanning mid April to mid October. The seasonal fluctuation in the number of adult I. ovatus was not as remarkable as was that of adult I. persulcatus. Adult I. ovatus occurred in large numbers in the period between the end of May and middle of July and again in the end of August. Both of tick species were most abundant during the period when a number of overwintered butterflies were observable. Seasonal highs of the two tick species also coincided with the time when some butterflies and flowers, both part of the scenic attractions of Konashidaira and Sanjiro, were in season contiguously.

N2  - Life history and larviparous reproduction cycle of Musca bezzii Patton et Cragg were investigated. The duration of larval and pupal development was reduced as the temperature rose to the range of 15 to 30℃. Threshold temperatures of development were 4.8℃ for larvae and 8.4℃ for pupae. Effective accumulative temperatures in larvae and pupae were 101.5 and 187.0 degree-days, respectively. It was confirmed that the female adults deposit the late first instar larvae. Blood ingestion rate of the female flies in the field was very low (3.9%). In ovarian development, first the largest follicle in two pairs of ovarioles formed mature eggs in 5-6 days after emergence and the next one reached maturity in 8-9 days; then egg maturation alternately took place in the left and right ovarioles at 2-3 days' intervals. Ovulation also alternately occurred after completion of egg maturation. The eggs hatched in the uterus about 16-24hr after ovulation, and most of the first instar larvae (16-24hr) were passed within the uterus. Fertilized females collected in the field most frequently deposited the larvae at 2 and 3 days' intervals at 30 and 25℃, respectively. The physiological age of female flies was classified into 5 categories based on the number of follicular relics in ovarioles, developmental stages of follicle and uterus contents. In each category, the calendar age of females was calculated. It was suggested that the determination of the physiological and calendar ages of the female flies of M. bezzii in the field is applicable within the limits of the possible.

N2  - Mite collections were carried out in the residences of allergic, 5 asthmatic and 1 atopic dermatitis, and non-allergic children, 5 non-asthmatic, living in and around Naha City, Okinawa Prefecture, from Oct. 1990 to Oct. 1991. Nineteen species of mites were isolated from the houses. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was the dominant species in all the houses with the distribution as follows : residence of asthmatic children 76.5-96.1%, child with atopic dermatitis 88.0% and non-asthmatic children 66.8-93.6%. Cheyletidae was second in dominance. In conjunction with D. pteronyssinus, the two accounted for 92.4 (86.8-98.7) and 91.5 (71.7-96.2)%, respectively, of the mites in the residences of allergic and non-allergic children. Very few D. farinae were found in the house dust collected, being 0.0-0.1 and 0.0-0.6% in the houses of allergic and non-allergic children, respectively. Seasonal variation in the distribution was also observed. D. pteronyssinus was dominant throughout the period. However, for the other species, Acaridae, Cheyletidae and Glycyphagidae were high in number in April whereas Euphthiracaridae increased in February and July. The highest number of mites was 62,275 and 81,000 in 1g of fine dust collected from the houses of allergic and non-allergic children, respectively. Generally, the number of mites collected from the houses of allergic and non-allergic children increased in May and again from August to October. There was no significant difference in the number and fauna of mites isolated in the residences of allergic and nonallergic.

N2  - To determine the vertebrate reservoirs for the spirochetes transmitted by Ixodes ovatus, the wood mice, Apodemus speciosus ainu, and the longtailed shrews, Sorex unguiculatus, were captured in Furano, Hokkaido during October 1992. Larval and nymphal ticks of I. ovatus were more abundant on the shrews than on the mice. The spirochetes were isolated repeatedly from earlobe tissues of both the mice and the shrews. The spirochetal isolates derived from the shrews contained the 30kDa homogeneous OspA protein, and were similar to the control strain of I. ovatus adult origin in their SDS-PAGE protein profile. In contrast, the isolates from the mice were polymorphic in their OspA proteins, and distinguishable from the shrew-derived isolates. All the spirochetal isolates from I. ovatus larvae feeding on the shrews were also identical with the control strain of I. ovatus adult origin. These data strongly suggest that S. unguiculatus is a reservoir for the spirochetes transmitted by I. ovatus. Similar enzootic cycles involving insectivores should be sought in the mainland of Honshu, Japan.

N2  - In order to elucidate the influence of types of houses, rooms, and flooring on the prevalence of house dust mites, surveys were undertaken in livingrooms and bedrooms of wooden Japanesestyle houses and concrete-built apartments in and around Nagoya City, from September 1983 to June 1985 at about 3-month intervals. The numbers of rooms examined were 33 livingrooms and 34 bedrooms in wooden houses, 27 and 29 in apartments, respectively. In wooden houses, the annual mean number of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was not significantly affected by room ratios (No. of rooms/family size), types of rooms, or flooring, whereas the number of D. farinae was significantly greater in houses with high room ratios (>1.3) than houses with low room ratios (<1.2). The prevalence of D. farinae was also affected by flooring; relatively large number of the mites was detected from carpeted floors. In apartments, the number of D. pteronyssinus decreased with the height from the ground, while the number of D. farinae did not significantly vary with the floor level, types of rooms, or flooring. These data suggested that there was no appreciable limiting factor for the prevalence of D. pteronyssinus in wooden houses, nor for D. farinae in apartments. It was also shown that the type of rooms had no significant influence on the prevalence of mites of both species. On carpeted floors, which has low humidity control capacity and thermal conductivity, the number of D. farinae was greater than that of D. pteronyssinus. The results suggested that microhabitats on carpeted floors were rather dry and more favorable for the prevalence of D. farinae than for D. pteronyssinus. On the other hand, on tatami and wood floors, which are known to have high humidity control capacity, the numbers of D. farinae in wooden houses and D. pteronyssinus in apartments varied greatly according to room ratio and floor level, respectively. Relatively large numbers of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus were detected from the plastic floors of apartments. These results suggested an interrelationship among the humidity requirements in mites, humid conditions of rooms influenced largely by room ratio in wooden houses and the floor level of apartments, and microclimates of the floor, which are influenced by humidity control capacity and thermal conductivity of flooring materials, in the prevalence of house dust mites.

N2  - Seasonal prevalences of tabanid flies were surveyed by CO_2-baited mosquito-net traps at Toyota Municipal Livestock Center in Aichi Prefecture during the fly season of 1991. In total 839 flies belonging to 3 genera, 11 species, were collected. Tabanus trigeminus was the most abundant, occupying 41.7% of the total catches, followed by T. trigonus (19.2%), T. rufidens (18.2%) and Atylotus bivittateinus (9.5%). Tabanid flies occurred mostly during middle July to early September with a peak in late July. The fly season of T. kinoshitai and T. trigeminus lasted for about 4 months, while that of T. fulvimedioides was about 20 days. Single or double activity peak at the midday or higher activity in the late daytime was observed during middle July to early September.

N2  - Resistance of Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Okinawa Prefecture to insecticides was investigated between 1970 and 1972,and in 1989. The mosquitoes collected from 8 localities in Okinawajima between 1970 and 1972 were resistant to organochlorines, p, p'-DDT, lindane and dieldrin, but those from a few localities were susceptible to 6 organophosphates except malathion and naled. The LC_<50> values of these strains were 0.012-0.61ppm for p, p'-DDT, 0.23-0.26ppm for lindane, 0.18-0.31ppm for dieldrin, 0.05-0.84ppm for malathion, and 0.036-0.26ppm for naled. However, in 1989,the species in Okinawajima and Ishigakijima was susceptible to p, p'-DDT, but resistant to organophosphates, especially malathion, fenitrothion, fenthion and temefos with LC_<50> values of 12.2-25.0,1.78-2.50,3.90-4.58 and 4.43-4.44ppm, respectively. The species was also resistant to propoxur (a carbamate) with LC_<50> value of 3.82-5.05ppm but susceptible to permethrin, a pyrethroid, with LC_<50> value of 0.0065-0.0072ppm.

N2  - Host attachment activity and development of larvae and nymphs were observed in I. persulcatus held in the laboratory under constant temperature (25℃), with various photoperiodic conditions (10L-14D, 12L-12D and 16L-8D). Larval attachment was hardly affected by photoperiod during the stages from eggs to unfed larvae, but nymphal attachment was inhibited by exposing to a short-day photoperiod (10L-14D) during the stages from engorged larvae to unfed nymphs. Both engorged larvae and nymphs were strongly affected by the photoperiodic conditions under which they were held before, during and after engorgement. The active development of engorged larvae occurred in exposure to a long-day photoperiod (16L-8D) before and/or during and after engorgement. The diapause of engorged larvae was induced by exposing to short-day photoperiods (10L-14D or 12L-12D) throughout the stages from eggs to engorged larvae. The diapause of engorged nymphs occurred in response to short-day photoperiods during and after engorgement. Exposure of engorged nymphs to a long-day photoperiod during and after engorgement prevented diapause. These results suggest that I. persulcatus is a long day type with a facultative diapause in the larval and nymphal stages. It is considered that the diapause of I. persulcatus larvae and nymphs, which is induced by short-day photoperiods, plays an important role in the synchronization of the activities of the nymphs and adults under favorable seasonal conditions of spring to summer.

N2  - A group of toxin-producing bacteria was isolated from two species of leeches, the Japanese land leech, Haemadipsa zeylanica japonica and the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis. The culture supernatant of one of the representative strains, designated as Y-1,had a property to cause acute death when it was inoculated in mice not only intravenously but also intraperitoneally. A prominent hyperemia was observed in the mouse skin especially when Y-1 was intravenously inoculated. The lethal and hyperemic effects of Y-1 culture supernatant totally disappeared when it was heated at 100℃ for 10min. The bacterium was found to belong to the Fluorescens group of the genus Pseudomonas. The present investigation revealed that these toxin-producing bacteria are prevalent among leech-inhabiting flora. Consequently it is highly probable that the acute death and the hyperemia due to product (s) of these bacteria might be associated with the blood-sucking behavior of the leech species. Another bacterium was also isolated from the medicinal leech. The bacterium was found to produce a toxic factor (s) which causes mouse death like Haemadipsa bacteria. This bacterium was found to belong to the Fluorescens group of genus Pseudomonas also.

N2  - To evaluate the reservoir competence of feral rodents for the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted by the ixodid tick Ixodes persulcatus, 523 rodents of 4 species were captured from 2 endemic sites in Furano and Nemuro, Hokkaido, during 1991. A total of 581 larvae and 144 nymphs of I. persulcatus were collected from these rodent specimens. The principal host of I. persulcatus immatures was the wood mouse Apodemus speciosus ainu. The immature ticks collected were examined for spirochetal infections by culturing their internal tissues in BSK medium. The spirochetes were isolated from 35 (20.6%) of 170 I. persulcatus larvae derived from 53 A. speciosus ainu in Furano, and 82 (69.5%) of 118 I. persulcatus larvae derived from 26 A. speciosus ainu in Nemuro. We also demonstrated the transstadial infections in I. persulcatus nymphs that had fed as larvae on A. speciosus ainu in Nemuro. Xenodiagnosis indicated that the mice retained the long-term infectivity for the vector ticks. The laboratory experiment was conducted to determine whether the infected nymphs of I. persulcatus transmit spirochetes to the uninfected A. speciosus ainu. The mice readily became infected by nymphal feeding and showed no morbidity during the infection. These data clearly indicate that A. speciosus ainu is a suitable reservoir host for B. burgdorferi transmitted by I. persulcatus in Hokkaido.

N2  - Simulium quinquestriatum (Shiraki), one of the multivoltine blackfly species in Japan, was studied with regard to its oviposition site preference, number of larval instars, and duration for development of aquatic stages. This species laid eggs on leaf blades trailing in the water, and also on splashed rock surfaces. Laboratory rearings at 14℃ showed that median periods (in days) for eggs, larvae and pupae were 6.5-7.5,33-53,and 6,respectively. The considerable difference noted in the larval period among rearing lots was attributed to the difference in food amount. Size-frequency distribution of larval head capsules suggested nine instar stages both in the laboratory and in the field.

N2  - A high dose of 6,400μg minocycline was initially injected subcutaneously into the back of the neck of a ddY mouse. Then 3,400μg were given every 12hr for 4 days. After 34hr from the first injection with minocycline Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (Rt) infected unfed larvae of L. fletcheri were attached to the mouse, and it was successful in killing Rt in mites. Out of 80 unfed larvae transferred into the ear lobe of the mouse with a fine paint brush under a stereomicroscope, 50 engorged larvae were recovered. Out of the 50,23 larvae developed into adults. Among them, 8 females (Parent generation) laid and average of 122.3 eggs (F_1), the number of laid eggs ranging from 34 to 230. The number of laid eggs was almost similar to the 133.5 eggs per Rt infected female, but less than the 170.9 eggs per Rt uninfected female. The females of L. fletcheri in the Rt infected colony produced only females, but uninfected females produced different sexes of progeny, i.e., females alone, males alone or both sexes in varied proportions by individual females. All of the F_1 larvae from the above mentioned P generation developed into only females, and males were found in F_2 for the first time in this infected colony after killing Rt at the P generation. The ratio of male to female was 297 : 4 (or 74.3 : 1). These data suggest that the presence of Rt in the ovary has a restraining effect on the birth of male progeny in the infected colony, because the sex of F_1 was determined to be female even though Rt was killed in the larval stage of the Parent generation.

N2  - Surveys of trombiculid mites were collected from wild rodents and soil, and isolation of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (Rt) from the rodents and engorged larvae were performed during the period from December 1984 to November 1985 in the northern part of Saitama Prefecture, Japan, where a patient of tsutsugamushi disease had been reported. The trombiculid mites collected from 114 rodents totalled 12,846 individuals, consisting of 6 species : Leptotrombidium (L.) fuji (36.8%), L. (L.) pallidum (36.8%), Gahrliepia (Gateria) saduski (24.0%), Neotrombicula (N.) japonica (2.1%), L. (L.) miyajimai (0.2%) and Eltonella (E.) ichikawai (0.1%). A total of 224 mites were also recovered from soil. They consisted of 4 species, namely, L. pallidum (40.6%), L. fuji (37.1%), G. saduski (18.3%) and N. japonica (4.0%). The presence of engorged larvae of L. pallidum and G. saduski in rodents reached a remarkably high peak in autumn; L. fuji showed high peaks in autumn and spring. On the other hand, the unfed larvae of these species in soil showed the highest peak in autumn or winter. Rts were isolated from only 60.7% (17/28) of L. pallidum recovered from rodents while none were isolated from the other 696 larvae consisting of 5 species. High ratios of Rt isolation, 33.3-58.9%, were especially successful in autumn and winter. Serological investigation of anti-Rt antibody in the rodents revealed 100% positive in December 1984 and November 1985,respectively, and 20.0-72.7% in other months. These results indicate that L. pallidum may serve as the most important vector of tsutsugamushi disease in this endemic area.

N2  - In order to elucidate the role of highly active carboxylesterases (CE's) in organophosphorus insecticide resistance, characteristics of CE's in a resistant strain of Culex pipiens molestus were investigated with special reference to their susceptibility to insecticides. Two CE's named E1 and E2 were separated from whole body larvae of a resistant strain by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). E1 was found specifically in alimentary canal of the larva and E2 was distributed in every tissue of the body. The activities of E1 and E2 in the resistant strain were several and 25-30 times higher than the corresponding CE in a susceptible strain, respectively. E1 was strongly inhibited by most of the organophosphates tested and was moderately inhibited by carbamates. On the other hand, E2 was inhibited by limited types of organophosphates and was not inhibited by S-n-propyl phosphorothioate and carbamates. Insecticides which strongly inhibited E2 gave a high resistance ratio or a strong synergistic effect. Very low dissociation constant of the CE to insecticides indicated that the CE's have no potential to hydrolyze the insecticides. These results support that CE's conjugate with the insecticide uptaken into the body cavity, and consequently prevent the access of the insecticide to the target.

N2  - A study was made to observe the effect of various kinds of diet in individual rearing methods on the life cycle of Lardoglyphus konoi under the condition of 30℃ and 96% R.H., in which the hypopus formed easily. For the breeding of the mites, it was found the animal diets were necessary and plant diets were unsuitable. The appearance rates of hypopi of the mite increased when the mites were reared in L. konoi powder, dry yeast powder or wholewheat flour. In the diets containing dry yeast powder, it seemed that the appearance rate of the hypopi was proportionate to the content of dry yeast powder.

N2  - The susceptibility to fenitrothion and permethrin of two species of fly pupal parasitoids, Spalangia endius and Nasonia vitripennis, which are important natural enemies of flies, was examined by the direct spray of the emulsifiable concentrate. The susceptibility of N. vitripennis (Toyama strain) to permethrin was 17.5 times and to fenitrothion 4.5 times higher respectively, than that of S. endius (Toyama strain). Small difference of susceptibility to both insecticides was recognized among three strains (Toyama, Miyazaki and USA) of S. endius. The treatment of pyriproxyfen (6.4μg/g medium) to the hosts did not have much influence on the emergence of the two species, and the emerged adults reproduced offspring normally. These results suggest the possibility of combined control by pyriproxyfen and mass releasing of the housefly parasitoids.

N2  - A study on attraction for two nuisance chironomid midges, Chironomus plumosus L. and Tokunagayusurika akamusi T., were carried out through the use of light of different colors, wattages, and wavelengths in light traps at the rooftop of the Suwa Hydrobiological Station. The color effects for attracting chironomid midges were tested by five kinds of 100W color incandescent lamps; white, yellow, blue, green, and red. The effects of light intensities were also studied using white lamps with four different wattages; 100,60,40,and 20. The effects of five different light wavelengths were studied using a BLB lamp (290-410nm), BL lamp (290-500), FLW lamp (350-705), FLY lamp (500-705) and white 100W lamp (control). The midges were attracted more to the quality (wavelength) than to the quantity (intensity) of light. This result indicated that the manipulation of light wavelength may be appropriate for the development of an overall integrated strategy to control nuisance chironomid midges in the Lake Suwa area.

N2  - The effect of the source and size of bloodmeal on egg production in Culex quinquefasciatus was investigated. Three vertebrate hosts (man, rat and chicken) were used as sources of bloodmeal. Results show that the differences in the amount of blood engorged from the various hosts were not significant. However, the number of eggs produced by the mosquitoes fed on the blood of the various hosts varied significantly (p<0.001). Female Cx. quinquefasciatus that took avian blood laid a greater number of eggs than those that fed on mammals.

N2  - The Guatemala-Japan Cooperative Project on Onchocerciasis Research and Control sponsored by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was run for 8 years (1975-1983), targeted mainly at the establishment of effective vector control measures of Guatemalan onchocerciasis by applying an insecticide to the streams inhabited by the principal vector, Simulium ochraceum. Following basic studies on taxonomy, biology and transmission of the suspected vector blackflies, extensive and intensive studies were carried out on insecticides, i.e., trough tests to determine the comparative effectiveness of various chemicals, laboratory tests to determine the extent of adsorption of insecticides to soil, and field tests to determine insecticidal carry in various types of streams and the behaviour of insecticides after application in streams. It gradually became clear that the special feature of this vector control lies in infestation of S. ochraceum larvae in streamlets, which accelerates adsorption of insecticides to streambeds, hence accounting for extremely short carry. Together with the information on distribution of the target streams based on geology, geomorphology and geography, the control strategy was established : applying 24g of 5% temephos wdp fortnightly to all the streams with the discharge range of 0.1-50 liter/sec, irrespective of the discharge rate. After the Phase 3 operation commenced in July 1982,the density of S. ochraceum on human bait was suppressed to an extremely low level far below 1.9 flies/man/hr, the critical level theoretically established. The epidemiological evaluation has been made, but final conclusions are not yet drawn.

N2  - Golden Malrin fly bait containing 1% methomyl bait plus Z-9 tricosene (Muscamone) was evaluated against Musca domestica L. population in a chicken farm in Malaysia. Application of methomyl bait at 50mg a.i./m^2 caused an almost sevenfold higher adult mortality rate than that of methomyl application at 10mg a.i./m^2. Methomyl, however, showed poor larvicidal effects on M. domestica. Thus, methomyl as an attractant bait formulation seems to have the potential for adult fly control in the field in Malaysia.

N2  - Cerebrospinal setariosis, or lumbar paralysis, caused by infection with Setaria digitata to sheep and goats results in serious economic loss for stock farmers in Ibaraki Prefecture, Central Japan. Seasonal fluctuations of vector mosquitoes were studied using light traps from May to October during 1989 and 1990. The traps were set in the evening in cattle sheds and sheep sheds. A total of 168,970 female mosquitoes belonging to 9 species were collected by light traps. Culex tritaeniorhynchus was the most abundant species followed by Cx. pipiens pallens and Anopheles sinensis. However, An. sinensis was the most abundant mosquito during the Setaria transmission season of June and July. One out of 408 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and four out of 312 An. sinensis dissected were found to carry thirdstage larvae of Setaria digitata. It is thus suspected that An. sinensis plays an important role in transmitting the larvae from cattle to sheep or goats in this area.

N2  - Three carboxylesterases (CE's) were separated by PAGE from an organophosphate resistant Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus (Okinawa strain). The first CE was found specifically in the alimentary canal and the second CE distributed throughout the larval body. These CE's were monomeric protein (MW : 60,000) and were categorized as B-type CE. The third CE was a homodimeric protein (MW : ca. 120,000) categorized as A-type CE and detected in all parts except the haemolymph. All CE's showed the characteristic inhibition pattern with organophosphates and carbamates, but their low dissociation constants indicated that the CE's had no hydrolyzing activity against these chemicals. It was supposed from the data presented that the CE's sequestered insecticides and prevented their access to the target, AChE in the central nervous system.

N2  - In order to investigate the influence of housing conditions on the prevalence of house-dust mites in concrete apartment buildings in and around Nagoya City, mite surveys were conducted in living rooms and bedrooms of 20 apartments on the 1st to 10th floors from September 1983 to June 1984 at about 3-month intervals. Allergic children were found in 16 apartments. The mite fauna did not differ much from previous reports : Dermatophagoides farinae (D.f.) and D. pteronyssinus (D.p.) were predominant, constituting about 82% of the totals, followed by Haplochthonius simplex, Euroglyphus maynei, Glycyphagidae, Cheyletidae, Acaridae, Cosmochthonius reticulatus, and Tarsonemidae. A significant negative correlation was found between the percentage compositions of D.f. and D.p. : D.p. had a tendency to predominate over D.f. in apartments with more than 4 members in a family, less than 0.8 of the room ratio (No. of rooms/family size), and on floor levels below the third floor. The numbers of D.p., Glycyphagidae, Tarsonemidae, and C. reticulatus were greater in low-floor apartments (below 3rd) than in high-floor apartments (above 4th). while the numbers of D.f., Acaridae, and Cheyletidae did not greatly vary with the floor levels. These results suggested that household activities and the distance from the ground level were limiting factors for the prevalence of house-dust mites in apartments. The cause of the habitat segregations was considered to be mainly due to the interaction of humidity requirements in mites and the dampness of microhabitats. The mite communities were more complicated in low-floor apartments than in high-floor apartments. The number of allergic children was also greater in low-floor apartments. These data suggested a relationship among the housing conditions, prevalence of mites, and allergic sensitization.

N2  - The genetic mode of warfarin resistance in Rattus rattus was studied by crossing experiments of resistant and susceptible colonies. The configuration of the selected colony, [RR]・F_1,was estimated to be [5/10 RR+3/10 RS+2/10 SS] from the plateaux on the log day-probit mortality curve. The log day-probit mortality line of the RR, or homozygous resistants, was estimated from the high mortality portion of the [RR]・F_1 curved line. The [RS]・F_1 colony was obtained by crossing the [RR]・F_1 with the Amami Colony, which is considered to be a homozygous susceptible colony (hereinafter referred to as SS). Theoretically, the [RS]・F_1 colony should be a mixed population of [13/20 RS+7/20 SS]. The theoretical curve thus calculated was similar to the observed curve. Accordingly, the estimated straight line for the RS, or heterozygous hybrids, was established. The [RS]・F_2 colony obtained by crossing [RS]・F_1×[RS]・F_1 should theoretically be a mixed population of [169/1,600 RR+702/1,600 RS+729/1,600 SS]; and the backcross [RRS]・F_1 colony obtained by crossing [RR]・F_1×[RS]・F_1 should theoretically be a mixed population of [169/800 RR+442/800 RS+189/800 SS]. The theoretical curves for the above two were compared with the observed curves. The observed curves were similar to the corresponding theoretical curves, except in respect to the high mortality portions. The reason for the discrepancy at the high mortality portion was not clear. Through these results, warfarin resistance in R. rattus was concluded to follow the mode of monofactorial Mendelian resistance; and from the locality of the RS line, the resistant gene should be incompletely recessive. The discriminating date should preferably be the 28th day, because the survivals on that date should be only the homozygous resistants, thereby enabling easy calculation of the RR ratio in any population concerned.

N2  - Seven colonies of Aedes albopictus larvae collected on 7 islands (Okinawajima, Agunijima, Miyakojima, Ishigakijima, Iriomotejima, Yonagunijima and Minamidaitojima) in Okinawa Prefecture in 1988 were tested for susceptibility levels to 11 insecticides. The (LC)_<50> values of these colonies were 0.057-0.855ppm to p, p'-DDT, 0.046-0.211ppm to malathion, 0.0035-0.0319ppm to fenitrothion, 0.029-0.044ppm to dichlorvos, 0.232-0.516ppm to trichlorfon, 0.163ppm to diazinon, 0.0055ppm to fenthion, 0.011ppm to temefos, 0.019-0.036ppm to bromofos, 2.563-4.922ppm to propoxur and 0.0039-0.0092ppm to permethrin. (LC)_<50>tto p, p'-DDT against the larvae in Iriomotejima was the highest value in Japan, being 50.6 times the lowest value (0.017ppm) obtained in Nagasaki, 1960 (Suzuki and Mizutani, 1962). Against fenitrothion, larvae in Minamidaitojima, Ishigakijima and Miyakojima showed 0.0319,0.0236 and 0.0220ppm respectively in (LC)_<50> value. In general, Ae. albopictus in Okinawa Prefecture was susceptible to all insecticides tested except p, p'-DDT.

N2  - The activity of pyriproxyfen as an insect sterilant was studied. Total number of eggs/female and hatchability or total number of progeny of the housefly and the German cockroach decreased with the topical application of pyriproxyfen in a dose-dependent manner. The sexual transmission of sterility by pyriproxyfen-treated males was also observed, although the dosage required to cause sterility to his partner was relatively higher. Ten min exposure to pyriproxyfen formulated in rapeseed oil with dosages of 100μg/(cm)^2 on aluminium surface for the housefly or 60 min exposure to more than 400μg/(cm)^2 for the German cockroach enabled males to transfer sterility to females by sexual intercourse

N2  - Developmental sequences of terminal follicles in laboratory-reared females and/or various reproductive characteristics, e.g., parity, follicular development and egg retention in field-caught females of hematophagous tabanids were observed to determine the modes of their reproduction. Out of 25 Hokkaido species (including 2 subspecies) studied, 12 proved to be autogenous in the first gonotrophic cycle while 13 were anautogenous. Most of the local populations of autogenous species (or subspecies) exhibited more than 90% parity whereas average parous rates of anautogenous species were less than 50%. The criteria were proposed for the distinction between autogenous and anautogenous populations based on the parity study in field-caught female tabanids. Seasonal changes of parous rates were presented for several anautogenous species in different habitats representing different densities of probable host animals for tabanids. Different host densities at the collection sites did not necessarily cause different patterns in seasonal changes of parous rates in host-seeking populations. Terminal follicles in ovaries among field-caught females ranged between Mer's stages I-V with most flies in stage II, I-II or I but stages III-V follicles were rather frequently observed in a few autogenous species. Appearance rates of flies with retained eggs in parous females were higher in the species which had a larger number of ovarioles.

N2  - Statistical data on the area of paddy fields and the number of livestock breeding farms in Osaka Prefecture during the period 1965-1986 were analyzed in relation to the recent reduction in the number of human Japanese encephalitis cases. Large numbers of human cases occurred in Osaka City in the epidemic years, 1965-1967. The reasons for the outbreak were considered to be : 1) the density of swine farms was relatively high in Osaka City; 2) the districts in the outskirts of Osaka City had developed paddy fields and a relatively high density of swine farms; and 3) the urban heat island wind enhanced centripetal invasion of the mosquitoes. Since 1973,the number of human cases has been only 0 to 3 a year in Osaka Prefecture and no cases occurred in Osaka City. Urbanization of the rural outskirts of Osaka City which resulted in significant decrease in swine farms and paddy fields throughout Osaka Prefecture may be responsible for the recent reduction in epidemics.

N2  - The ecological studies on Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus during the period 1967-1986 in Osaka Prefecture revealed the following points. 1) In areas with a large population of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, the mosquito-swine cycle of JE virus occurred every year, indicating build-up of dense populations of infected mosquitoes, and the peak of vector infection rate often occurred earlier than the peak of vector density. However, if the peak of vector infection rate occurred later than the peak of vector density, no cases of JE broke out despite the large mosquito population. Conversely, in any year that the peak of vector infection rate occurred earlier than the peak of vector density, JE cases tended to occur. 2) In areas with a small mosquito population, the transmission cycle of JE virus did not often occur, the peak of vector infection rate tended to occur later than the peak of vector density, and the density of infected mosquitoes might be low even if the peak of vector infection rate occurred earlier than the peak of vector density. Therefore, extremely few JE cases were expected. 3) It was suggested that only in areas with a large population of the mosquitoes, the timing of the peak of vector infection rate i.e., whether it was earlier or later than the peak of vector density, has significant impact on the transmission of the virus from the mosquito-swine cycle to man.

N2  - The effects of swine immunization during 1967-1973 as one of the precautionary measures against Japanese encephalitis (JE) were examined on the basis of the results of natural infection of Culex tritaeniorhynchus with JE virus and of incidence of human JE cases. The swine were immunized with live attenuated JE virus vaccine during this period except in 1967 when inactivated vaccine was used. From the point of view that JE viral infection rates vary depending upon mosquito abundance, it can be said that the infection rate of mosquitoes was lower in vaccinated areas than in unvaccinated areas in 1968-1970. However, in 1967 and 1969,8 and 2 human JE cases, respectively, were confirmed from vaccinated areas. This suggests that swine vaccination was not effective enough for control of JE among humans. Infection rate, the earliest date of isolation of JE virus from mosquitoes and the level of mosquito population tended to vary with the environmental condition of the collection sites. Therefore, comparison of the results of natural infection of mosquitoes with JE virus between the vaccinated years and unvaccinated years in areas which are favourable for the production of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and infected mosquitoes, will reveal the effectiveness of swine vaccination.

N2  - To examine the influence of housing conditions on the prevalence of house-dust mites and allergy, mite surveys were conducted in bedrooms and living rooms of 22 wooden Japanese-style houses in and around Nagoya City, from September 1983 to June 1984 at about 3-month intervals. Allergic children were found in 11 houses. The mite fauna did not differ much from previous reports : Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus were dominant, constituting 77% of the total mite number, followed by Haplochthonius simplex, Tarsonemidae, Glycyphagidae, Cosmochthonius reticulatus, Cheyletidae, and Acaridae. A significant negative correlation was found between the percentage compositions of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus : D. farinae had a tendency to increase with the room ratio (the number of rooms in a house to the family size), which was taken as an index of household activities, while the abundance of D. pteronyssinus was not greatly affected by housing conditions. Analyses of interspecies relations and interrelations between housing conditions and mite levels suggested that the house-dust mites could be classified into three groups : Group 1 consists of D. farinae and Oribatei prevailing in houses with high room ratio (>1.3); Group 2 consists of Glycyphagidae, Tarsonemidae and probably Acaridae prevailing in houses with low room ratio (<1.2); Group 3 consists of D. pteronyssinus and Cheyletidae prevailing regardless of housing conditions in wooden houses. The cause of these habitat segregations was considered to be a function of interactions between the humidity requirements in the mites and dampness in the microhabitats influenced by household activities. Simpson's index of mite diversity and the number of allergic children were significantly greater in houses with low room ratio than in houses with high room ratio. Although the number of mites in houses with allergic children was not greater than that in houses with non-allergic children, the diversity index was greater in the former houses. These data suggested a relationship among the prevalence of house-dust mites, allergic sensitization, and housing conditions, particularly room ratio.

N2  - To obtain information about photo- and dark-recovery phenomena with regard to the lethal effect of UV radiation, dose responses in adult German cockroaches to 5 kinds of irradiation regimes were investigated. No significant difference in UV dose responses was observed among three groups exposed continuously to UV radiation or alternatively, to UV and visible light or darkness at 30min intervals. However, responses in two groups exposed continuously or intermittently (1min intervals) to UV radiation for 30min daily were different from the previous three groups and the mortality in these two groups increased significantly. Furthermore, in an additional group exposed to intensive visible light after continuous UV irradiation for 30min, the mortality increased with the length of visible light exposure. These results indicated that the lethal effect of UV radiation was accumulative and that photo- and dark-recovery mechanisms were absent in adult German cockroaches, suggesting a high possibility of cockroach control with UV radiation.

N2  - Adopting the method of individual rearing, the present study was made to observe the effect of relative humidity at temperatures under 25 and 30℃ on the life cycle of Lardoglyphus konoi. The relative humidities were regulated using saturated salt solution, K_2CO_3 (35% R. H.), NH_4NO_3 (66,65% R. H.), NaCl (76,78% R. H.), KCl (84,84% R. H.) and KNO_3 (88,92% R. H.), and water (94,96% R. H.). The diet was a mixture of dry yeast powder and fish meal powder in the same weight ratio. At 25℃ and 35% R. H., the eggs did not hatch. At 66% R. H. under 25℃ and at 65% R. H. under 30℃, the eggs developed to larvae but not to protonymph. Higher temperature and higher humidity shortened the duration of development from egg to adult. In this study, the maximum duration of development from egg to adult was 11.5±0.3 days in females and 11.4±0.4 days in males under the conditions of 25℃ and 76% R. H.; the minimum was 6.5±0.2 days in females and 6.1±0.2 days in males under the conditions of 30℃ and 96% R. H. The appearance rate of hypopus was increased at higher temperature and higher relative humidity. The maximum rate was at 37.3% at 30℃ and 96% R. H. Under the same rearing conditions duration of the protonymphal stage of the individuals which became hypopus was about one day longer than that of the individuals which became adult. The total number of eggs laid per female was larger at 25℃ than 30℃, and at higher relative humidity. The largest number of eggs laid by one female, 334.3±42.2,was at 25℃ and 94% R. H.

On the other hand, treatment with 2.7ppm emulsion of dichlorvos 2%+fenthion 3% greatly decreased the population of these non-target aquatic organisms in drains. The toxicity of methoprene and some insecticides against Physa fontinalis (Mollusca) and A. hilgendorfii, which cohabit urban drains, was assessed in the laboratory. Significant difference in the toxicity against P. fontinalis was found between methoprene and the other insecticides tested : 48hr LC_<50> values were 1.9ppm for fenitrothion and dichlorvos, 2.5ppm for diazinon, but 10.6ppm for methoprene. Meanwhile, the 48hr LC_<50> values of fenitrothion, dichlorvos, diazinon, methoprene and fenthion to the young nymphs of A. hilgendorfii were 0.018,0.035,0.25,0.3 and 0.65ppm, respectively.

N2  - When the smoke particles of mosquito coil containing dl, d-T80-allethrin as an active ingredient were observed using the scanning microscope, the diameter of the particles trapped at 3 and 30cm above the burning point of the coil were less than 0.2μm and 0.4 to 1.0μm, respectively. From the observation of the particles using X-ray microanalyzer, where the active ingredient was permethrin, it was revealed that the active ingredient existed on or in the particles. Therefore, it can be considered that the smoke particles played an important role to distribute the active ingredient in air. On the other hand, the knockdown efficacy of the coil containing allethrin against Culex mosquitoes decreased with increase of the smoke density. Since the existence rate of allethrin on the larger smoke particles became larger with the smoke density, the smoke of the coil might be deterrent factor in reducing the knockdown efficacy of the coil against the mosquitoes.

N2  - The swarming males of Rheotanytarsus kyotoensis were caught by sound traps in the field. The swarms were formed at 0.3-2.5m above the water surface of a river. More than 97% of R. kyotoensis caught from the swarm were males. The swarming males were mainly caught by the sound traps emitting the sound of frequencies between 180 and 300Hz during the experimental period from October to December. However, the most attractive frequency changed to ca. 11Hz/℃ between 8.8 and 18.2℃. Moreover, the swarming males responded to a narrow range of sound frequency at an ambient air temperature.

N2  - Egg period and larval growth of Simulium kawamurae Matsumura were examined in the laboratory. Eighty-seven out of 96 wild caught gravid females (90.6%) laid eggs successfully in the laboratory. In total, 49.8% of the eggs developed and hatched. Median developmental period of eggs was 10.5,7.5,4.5,4.5 and 3.5 days from oviposition to hatch at 10,14,18,22 and 26±1℃, respectively. Larvae were reared with a stir-bar system, and pupation occurred 39-44 days (14℃) and 29-50 days (18℃) after hatch. Pupal periods were 5.5 days at 14℃ and 4-4.5 days at 18℃. There was no difference in preimaginal periods between sexes. Nine larval instars were recognized from postgenal length frequency distribution of larval exuviae. Five generations per year were expected in wild population based on the daily cumulative temperature for a life span of the species and annual temperature regime in the habitat.

N2  - Growth patterns of Aedes albopictus populations were investigated for 10 weeks under four environmental conditions in the laboratory. The environmental conditions of populations differed in two environmental factors, the interval of blood feeding (1 or 3 weeks) and the amount of larval food (25 or 12.5mg/week). Changes in larval and adult density, size of pupae and number of adults produced in each environment were examined. The pattern of larval population growth was different between populations with different blood feeding intervals, but the larval populations under different larval food conditions showed the similar pattern of growth. When a blood source was supplied weekly, the population achieved a higher density level of larvae and adults and the larval population showed weekly fluctuations. The sizes of female pupae were different under rich and poor larval food conditions, but no differences were observed in the size of pupae between populations with different intervals of blood feeding. The response of the population productivity to the different environmental conditions was analyzed and the interdependence between the two environmental factors was discussed.

N2  - Cross-reactivities of murine IgE-inducing hemoglobins (Hbs) among chironomid larvae belonging to various taxa were examined by PK type skin tests on the rats. Mouse IgE antibodies to a dimeric Hb component (DVI) of Chironomus yoshimatsui (CY), belonging to tribe Chironomini of subfamily Chironominae, reacted to dimeric Hb components from species of tribe Tanytarsini of Chironominae and subfamily Orthocladiinae as well as those of several genera of Chironomini. Similarly, IgE antibodies to a monomeric Hb component (MV) of Polypedilum nubifer (PNf) of Chironomini even reacted to a monomeric Hb of a species of subfamily Tanypodinae, distantly related to Chironomini, in addition to those of genera of Chironomini, Tanytarsini and Orthocladiinae. In contrast, IgE antibodies to a monomeric Hb component (MI) of CY reacted only to monomeric Hbs from some species of Chironomus and a species of Camptochironomus, closely related to Chironomus. Therefore, Hbs such as CY-DVI and PNf-MV are a promising candidate as a screening agent of chironomid hypersensitivity, while Hbs such as CY-MI can be used for estimation of the sensitizing species for a particular patient.

N2  - The oviposition, development and survival of the two Ixodes species, I. persulcatus and I. nipponensis, were observed at 16 to 35℃ and ca. 100% RH. The preoviposition periods of I. persulcatus and I. nipponensis were prolonged with decreasing temperatures ranging from 16 to 30℃. The preoviposition period of I. persulcatus was shorter at low and middle temperatures (16 to 25℃) than that of I. nipponensis. The critical low temperature for oviposition of I. persulcatus was 2.9℃, which was lower than that (5.6℃) of I. nipponensis. The egg hatchability of I. nipponensis was high at 16 to 32℃, but that of I. persulcatus was markedly reduced at a high temperature (32℃). The incubation period of eggs of I. persulcatus was considerably shorter at a low temperature (16℃) than that of I. nipponensis. The critical low temperatures for hatching of eggs of I. persulcatus and I. nipponensis were 2.2 and 7.4℃, respectively. Engorged larvae and nymphs of I. nipponensis molted at all temperatures from 16 to 35℃, whereas those of I. persulcatus did not molt at a high temperature (35℃). The developmental periods of engorged larvae and nymphs of I. persulcatus were markedly shorter at a low (16℃), when compared with those of I. nipponensis. The critical low temperatures for molting of engorged larvae and nymphs of I. persulcatus were -2.7 and 6.0℃, respectively, while those of respective stages of I. nipponensis were 9.6 and 13.5℃. These results suggest that I. persulcatus is adapted to cooler conditions than I. nipponensis.

Reduction in the ability to pass through a net barrier and the rate of blood-feeding during the period oocysts are present was notable. However, net passage and bait-feeding activities in sporozoite-infected mosquitoes following disappearance of the oocyst were entirely restored.

N2  - We investigated statistically the cases of 85 patients with scabies who admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Dermatological Division, Shizuoka Red Cross Hospital, from 1981 to 1990. Of 85 patients 58 were male, the male-female ratio was 2.1 : 1. The teenager was the dominant age group. As to the seasonal change the number of patients was larger in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. The number of patients was maximum in November and minimum in June. Mites or eggs were found from 32(43%) out of 75 patients who received microscopic examination. About the half number of patients consulted us for the first time after 1 to 3 months duration of the illness. Mites or eggs were found easily in cases of more than 7 months duration of the illness. Intrafamilial transmission was found to be the main cause of scabies. The ratio of the scabies patients to all new patients from 1981 to 1990 was 0.247% in our hospital. This ratio was the smallest among the data of other dermatological clinics in Japan. The main reason was probably that the patients with scabies were not concentrated in our hospital, because there were many dermatological clinics in Shizuoka City.

N2  - From July 1984 to October 1990,the mite faunas were studied in the house-dust from the residences of 61 patients (17 males and 44 females) with suspected acarine dermatitis. The human infestation of mites occurred most frequently in June to November every year. The highest incidence was observed in females (65.6%) between teens and fifties. Eighteen species in 10 families were found in 47 (77.0%) out of 61 cases, and dominant species were Dermatophagoides farinae (49.2%), D. pteronyssinus (29.5%), Haplochthonius simplex (26.2%), Chelacaropsis moorei (23.0%), Cosmochthonius reticulatus (19.7%), and others. In 25 cases (41.0%), 5 biting mite families such as Cheyletidae (20 cases), Laelapidae (6 cases), Dermanyssidae (4 cases), Ornithonyssus bacoti (2 cases) and Pyemotidae (1 case) were found.

N2  - Some recent models for transmission dynamics of malaria and Japanese encephalitis have incorporated non-random selection of host individuals by vector mosquitoes or selection of alternative host species according to relative host density and attractiveness. Effects of these factors on transmission dynamics were evaluated in terms of the basic reproductive rate of pathogens (R) and infection rates of host and vector populations. Dye and Hasibeder (1986) and Hasibeder and Dye (1988) suggested that non-homogeneous contact between vector and host populations increases R and contributes to persistence of malaria infection, although the proportion of infected humans does not always increase with increased non-homogeneity. Kingsolver's model (Kingsolver, 1987) showed that preference of infected hosts to healthy hosts in vector mosquitoes also contributes to malaria persistence. A simple model for malaria control by use of bednets was presented here, which incorporated blood-seeking behavior among humans using and not using bednets. If mosquitoes attack unprotected people more frequently than before the use of bednets in the area, malaria control may be difficult because R can increase due to introduced non-homogeneity in vector-human contact. Sota and Mogi (1989a, b) used a model system of one vector species with two bloodmeal host species to analyze variable influences of livestock density on malaria and Japanese encephalitis dynamics. They suggested that zooprophylaxis for malaria control may fail when introduced livestock provide more bloodmeals for mosquitoes and contribute to an increase in mosquito density. In their model for Japanese encephalitis, relative density of humans to swine and host preference in mosquitoes determine the risk of human infection. The model suggested that the human risk is at maximum when mosquitoes feed equally on humans and swine, and that a high human risk is present even at low swine densities because of strong preference for swine in mosquitoes.

Lambdacyhalothrin and deltamethrin were more effective compared to permethrin during evaluation at a garbage dumping ground, causing high percentage of fly larval knockdown at 1hr and larval mortality 24hr after spraying. Applications at a poultry farm showed that all three pyrethroids were equally effective against fly larvae, 1hr after spraying and lambdacyhalothrin was the most effective insecticide 24hr after spraying.

N2  - The mite fauna of 74 house dust samples collected by season from 3 apartment houses and 4 separate houses in Seoul, Korea was examined microscopically. House dust mite antigen content was measured by the use of enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition method. Of 9,638 collected mites, pyroglyphid mites comprised 70.5% and Dermatophagoides farinae was the dominant species (55.5%). Mite density and mite antigen content were highest in autumn and lowest in winter. These were higher in separate houses than in apartment houses. Positive correlation between mite density and mite antigen content was observed (r=0.45). The relatively low density of house dust mites in dust samples in apartment houses and in Korea was discussed in relation to family density, habitable floor area and use of "Ondol" floor heating system.

N2  - The biting and resting behaviors of Anopheles albimanus were observed in a rural village of southern Guatemala, with the aim of improving the residual spraying method for malaria control. Seasonal changes in the biting density and behavior were studied by fortnightly human bait collection inside and outside houses for 2 and a half years. Biting activity peaked twice a year in June and November. All-night collections revealed that biting usually began just after sunset and was at the maximum during the first 3hr after sunset. The biting rate was almost equal between inside and outside houses in the early stage of the observations, but after residual applications of insecticides the population demonstrated a tendency of exophagy. The majority of mosquitoes which bit inside a house flew out of the house within a few hours and only a few percent of individuals remained there until the next morning. No avoidance of insecticide residues was noted and the greater part of the insects that rested on the residue of propoxur was killed before exiting. A survey of daytime resting places revealed the majority on the undersurface of the roof of a variety of sheds.

N2  - The toxicity of a glutamate blocker, 1-naphthylacetyl spermine, was studied on arthropods in the genera : Insecta, Crustacea, Diplopoda and Chilopoda. 1-Naphthylacetyl spermine applied with food, showed the lethal effect on the wood louse, Armadillidium vulgare, the sow bug, Porcellio scaber, the millipede, Oxidus gracilis, and the beetle, Gonocephalum coriaceum. In the cockroach, Blattella germanica, the oral administration with food gave no toxicities, although the intrathoratic injection caused a reversible paralysis. 1-Naphthylacetyl spermine also showed the toxicity against the house centipede, Thereuopoda ferox and larvae of Culex pipiens pallens.

N2  - The migration of blow flies from the lowland to the highland was investigated at Mts. Tateyama in Chubu Sangaku National Park in 1985 and 1986. To capture the adult flies, 30 bait-traps were set between altitudes of 420 and 900m along the valley of Shomyo River at the foot of Mts. Tateyama. The capturing period was from May 8 to June 12 in 1985 and from April 30 to July 2 in 1986. The dominant species were Calliphora nigribarbis and C. vomitoria. A total of 8,909 and 13,990 adults was marked and released in 1985 and 1986,respectively, at an altitude of 660m. Bait-traps of a permanent type were set at altitudes of 1,000,1,500,2,000,2,300,2,500 and 2,700m for continuous recapturing. Eighteen and 17 females were recaptured in 1985 and 1986,respectively, by these traps of higher than 2,000m. All of them were C. vomitoria. Only one marked female of C. nigribarbis was recaptured in 1985 at 1,500m. In 1986 additional recapturing was conducted by the bait-traps at 420 to 900m along the valley of Shomyo River. C. vomitoria flies were never recaptured at lower altitudes than the release place. On the other hand, C. nigribarbis flies were recaptured at both higher and lower altitudes than the release place. These results indicate that C. vomitoria has a strong tendency to migrate to the alpine and subalpine zones in early summer and may stay there during the summer season, whereas C. nigribarbis does not have such steady migration pattern.

N2  - To seize the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in Nagano Prefecture, we examined I. persulcatus and I. ovatus ticks for spirochetal infection in 1990. The ticks swept at 20 sites were tested by culturing their midgut tissues or by an indirect immunofluorescence assay using the monoclonal antibody, H5332. The spirochete was detected in the ticks from 18 sites. The infection rates for the adult ticks of I. persulcatus and I. ovatus were 21.3% (68/319) and 25.1% (76/303), respectively. Such the high prevalence of the spirochete in the tick vectors was comparable to that in the Western Europe.

N2  - Chromosome observations of triatomine bugs known as medically important vectors of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease) were attempted. We demonstrated by the C-banding technique that a Brazilian strain of Triatoma infestans includes at least three cytotypes in terms of constitutive heterochromatin polymorphism. We found cytological evidence that there is a significant difference in cytotype frequencies between observed values and expected ones from Hardy-Weinberg principle. This evidence suggests a genetic regulation or an incompatibility mechanism between cytotypes, which will serve as hopeful cytological markers for vector control.

N2  - The effect of encasement of bedding with high-density fabric was examined in an effort to prevent infestation with house-dust mites. The study was conducted using the bedding of 22 asthmatic patients. They were divided into 2 groups; floor bedding (futon mattress), blanket and pillow encased with a high-density fabric were supplied to 1 group, and to the other group bedding was supplied without such encasement. Both of the encased and unencased bedding were wrapped in cotton sheets. Dust was collected from 2m^2 of the upper surface of the cotton sheet before and 4 weeks after the encasement. The mites found were mostly Dermatophagoides. The numbers of both live and dead mites decreased significantly by the encasement. The proportion of futon mattress infested with more than 10 live mites/2m^2 was lower in the encased (0/8) than in the unencased bedding (2/14) after 4 weeks. That with dead mites was also lower in the encased than in the unencased bedding (1/8 and 9/14,respectively).

N2  - The effects of juvenile hormone analogue (methoprene, JHA) on ovarian development of the reproductive-diapausing parasitic fly, Melinda pusilla (Villeneuve) (Diptera : Calliphoridae), were investigated. The ovarian development of reproductive-diapausing females in the early stage of overwintering was accelerated by JHA treatment dose-dependently from the pre-vitellogenic stage to the vitellogenic stage, although the effect of a single dose (1μg) of JHA treatment was not enough to terminate the reproductive diapause. Two or 4 repeats of JHA treatments (1μg/one dose) at 5 days' intervals induced 100% egg maturation within 10 to 20 days after the treatment. In fermales in the middle stage of overwintering, a single dose of JHA treatment accelerated follicle development but did not accomplish egg maturation. In the late stage of overwintering, in which 80% of the females had matured eggs in accordance with the reproductive diapause termination, JHA treatment enhanced moving of the matured eggs into the uterus. These results suggest that JHA works dose-and stage-dependently on the termination of reproductive diapause in overwintering M. pusilla.

N2  - Hypopi of the lardoglyphid mite, Lardoglyphus konoi (Sasa et Asanuma), reared individually did not molt into tritonymphs. Hypopi, which were mass-reared with adults of their own species, attached to the adults and molted into tritonymphs at a low rate. Molting of mass-reared hypopi occurred also when they were placed on yeast suspension, but no hypopi molted when they were placed on agar or starch. Molting of individually-reared hypopi was low on yeast suspension, and, likewise, none molted on agar or starch. Hypopi could also attach to larvae of the dermestid beetle, Attagenus unicolor japonicus Reitter, but they tended to leave from the larvae and further development did not occur. The hairs of the larvae of another beetle, Anthrenus verbasci L., prevented attachment of hypopi. Hypopi of L. konoi, on the contrary, attached very easily to larvae of the third dermestid beetle, Dermestes maculatus DeGeer. Transstadial migration of hypopi through developmental stages of the beetle from larvae to adults was also observed. Swollen hypopi of L. konoi successfully molted into tritonymphs at the highest rate after attachment to adult D. maculatus. Longevity of hypopi was shortest when they were reared individually. These results might indicate that attachment of hypopi of L. konoi to other organisms is the fundamental behavior for their longterm survival and molting into tritonymphs.

N2  - Exclusive use of the pyrethroid cypermethrin to control German cockroaches in urban apartments resulted in control failure resistance after limited exposure. From 1986 to 1990 cypermethrin was applied twice yearly to kitchens and bathrooms for German cockroach control in 1,500 apartments in Roanoke, Virginia. In 1988 application of cypermethrin resulted in only a 70% reduction of cockroach infestations, a 20% reduction was recorded in 1989,and 21% in 1990. Control failure is attributed to high-level resistance to cypermethrin. An LD_<50> resistance ratio of 180,and a KT_<50> ratio of 2.9 was recorded from the German cockroaches exposed to cypermethrin with this treatment scheme.

N2  - Reproductive characteristics of the dung beetle, Onthophagus gazella F., which fed on pastured cattle dung in the laboratory were analyzed in relation to the freezing-thawing treatment and sampling season of the dung. The short-term freezing of dung did not affect the mean number of progenies emerged. The mean number of progenies emerged, the emergence rate and the size of progenies were all satisfactory when beetles fed on frozen-thawed dung sampled during June and August. The dung sampled in November, with which the least number of progenies was produced, contained less crude protein, crude fat and water, but contained more organic cell walls. The crude chemical composition of dung sampled in other months, however, did not show significant difference each other. These findings might give fundamental knowledge for maintaining and mass-rearing of the beetle in the laboratory in midwinter when cattle dung is no more available in pastures.

N2  - A synthetic chemical, 0.5% granules of pyriproxyfen (S-31183), which acts as a juvenile hormone, was tested against Culex pipiens pallens and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus under field conditions. This compound was extremely effective against larvae of both species which showed high resistance to organophosphorus insecticides. Complete inhibition of adult emergence continued for 3 weeks or more in open polyethylene containers and irrigation ditches at a dosage of 0.01ppm, in cesspools at 0.05ppm and in sewers with inflow of house wastewater at 0.1ppm (AI). Activity of the compound was retained after a drying of the test site for several days. For evaluation of the effect of IGRs in the field, pupal isolates are preferable to larval isolates.

N2  - To examine the influence of environmental conditions in human dwellings on the prevalence of house dust mites, Dermatophagoides spp., house dusts were sampled from living rooms and bedrooms of wooden Japanese-style and concrete apartment houses in and around Nagoya City, from September 1983 to June 1985 at about 3-month intervals. Mites were isolated using a floatation method. In the wooden houses, the annual mean density of D. farinae (D. f.) showed positive correlations with the number of rooms or the room ratio (the number of rooms to the family size), which was taken as an index of household activities, and a negative correlation with the family size. No significant correlation, however, was found between the mean density of D. pteronyssinus (D. p.) and the number of rooms, the room ratio, or the family size. From these results, household activities, which are generally high in the houses with lower room ratio, smaller number of rooms, and larger family size, and related with indoor humidity, were noted to be a principal factor influencing the distribution and abundance of D. f. in the wooden houses. By contrast, in the apartment houses the annual mean density of D. p. showed a positive correlation with the family size, and a negative correlation with the room ratio. No significant correlation was noted between the mean density of D. f. and the family size or the room ratio. The number of D. p. reduced inversely with the level of the apartment houses, but that of D. f. did not largely vary with the level. Thus, household activities and the level from the ground appeared to be limiting factors influencing the prevalence of D. p. in the apartment houses. Positive correlations existed between the mean densities of either species from living rooms versus bedrooms of the wooden and apartment houses. No correlation was found between the mite densities and age of houses, or house dust load.

N2  - Catecholamine and polyamine as well as serotonin and histamine contained in spider venom glands of nine typical Japanese species were quantified. Spider venoms generally appeared poor in either catecholamine and serotonin but rich in polyamine. However, only Chiracanthium japonicum was distinguishable since large amounts of norepinephrine, epinephrine and serotonin were contained. We also examined chromatographic elution patterns of the venomous substances by using high performance liquid chromatography with a reversed-phase column, and found that a venom fraction from the spiders belonging to genus Agelena blocked lobster neuromuscular synapse in an irreversible manner.

N2  - Fluctuation of fly fauna in livestock and poultry farms was studied at two sites in Ibaraki Prefecture from March to December 1989. A total of 116,042 flies (ca. 15 spp.) were collected with bait-traps. Four species of Muscidae accounted for 86.8% of the total flies collected; these were 28.7% Muscina stabulans Fallen, 24.1% Fannia sp., 23.4% F. canicularis L. and 10.6% Musca domestica L. At the Wakamiya site consisting of an oxenshed, a poultry farm, a cowshed, a swine farm and a house, M. stabulans occurred predominantly and showed a bimodal fluctuation that reached a high density in June and November. The density of M. domestica was relatively low, also showing peaks in June and November. On the other hand, at the Kibe site consisting of an oxenshed, a poultry farm and a house, Fannia sp. and F. canicularis predominated, and their densities reached peaks in June and July, followed by an abrupt decline in August. The number of flies collected showed a large variation among traps. This variation seemed to relate to the farm environment where flies are likely to prefer folds with poor ventilation or places where treacly feedingstuffs and powdered milk were stocked or handled. Furthermore, higher percentages of M. domestica were trapped in sunny and bright places, while higher percentages of M. stabulans and Fannia spp. occupied obscure and dim places.

N2  - To elucidate the ecological role of prolonged quiescence (diapause) in proto- and/or pharate tritonymphs of the house dust mite, Dermatophagoides farinae, five groups of nymphs which became quiescent at different periods in May, June, July 1988 and September 1989,were placed in a house room from November of the each year until June 1990. They were incubated over saturated sodium choride solution in a tightly fitted plastic box. Most of the nymphs in each group overwintered and terminated quiescence almost synchronously during the period from April to June (mainly, May) of the following year, irrespective of the time when they entered into quiescence. A few nymphs continued quiescence for over 1 year, and most of them overwintered again and also moulted in April. These results suggest that the prolonged quiescent nymphs have a key role in regulating the population dynamics of the mites with their ability to overwinter and to provide breeding stocks for the population growth in spring through summer.

N2  - Warfarin-resistant roof rats, Rattus rattus, were trapped from known resistant population infestations in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo and reared on flour-type baits containing 0.025% (w/w) warfarin. Results of active ingredient intake and median lethal days were 3,703.8mg/kg and 145 days, respectively. On the other hand, active ingredient intake and median lethal days in a colony of warfarin-susceptible roof rats trapped in Amami-Oshima reared on the same toxic baits described above were 107.0mg/kg and 7.3 days, respectively. Moreover, all rats of the Amami-Oshima colony died within 2 weeks. The roof rats of the Shinjuku colony survived for 1 year or more, and their active ingredient amount ingested was about 36 times as much as that of the Amami-Oshima colony. In comparison of median lethal days, the Shinjuku colony was about 20 times as long as that of the Amami-Oshima colony.

N2  - Adults of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were collected by light traps at a pigsty in Hijima-cho, Kochi City, from March to September for 12 years (1968 to 1973,1984 to 1989). The field population showed shortening of the wing length every summer. The average weekly temperature during the sampling period was a major environmental factor which affects seasonal fluctuation of the wing length. A highly negative correlation was also obtained between the wing length and the average number of adult females collected during June and September. Similar results were obtained from laboratory experiments to determine effects of temperature and larval density on the wing length of adults. The number of ovarioles in laboratory populations decreased under extremely high larval densities, and that in field populations varied in accordance with the wing length.

A large number of males of Micropsectra yunoprima Sasa, 1984,swarming at the side of Lake Myojin and Lake Taisho were collected also with insect net during daytime at Kamikochi. All the adult males among them were dissected and mounted on slides, and a total of 9 species (including a new genus and 4 new species) were identified from the collections at Kamikochi, and also 17 species (including 6 new species) from those of Asama-Onsen.

N2  - Surveys were undertaken to reveal the population dynamics of house dust mites, Dermatophagoides spp., in floor dusts collected from living rooms and bedrooms of 10 homes in and around Nagoya City, at about 3 month intervals from September 1983 to June 1985. All homes were more or less infested with both species of D. farinae (D. f.) and D. pteronyssinus (D. p.). Mean population density of D. f. exhibited seasonal fluctuation with the highest number in September or June and the lowest in March in most of these homes, irrespective of room types and floor materials. The population structure of D. f. changed by season; relative increase of nymphs in winter populations was characteristic, suggesting the appearance of some desiccation-tolerant nymphs. On the contrary, seasonal fluctuation of D. p. populations varied from home to home according to the types of rooms and floor materials. Relatively large numbers of D. p. were found in December or March in some homes. No marked difference was seen in the population structure of D. p. between summer and winter populations. It was noted that the population density and structure of D. p. were almost constant in bedrooms with tatami floors. D. p. had a tendency to dominate in homes with fewer rooms to the family size. From these results, it was concluded that the population dynamics of D. f. and D. p. differed to some degree, although they have similar ecological niche. The difference seemed to be due mainly to the appearance of diapause nymphs in winter populations of D. f., but not in D. p. populations.

N2  - The effects of Plasmodium infection upon the behaviour of vector mosquitoes were examined by the cage-test method. Anopheles stephensi parasitized with Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis had reduced ability to pass the wide-mesh net barrier. The reduction was particularly remarkable when there was no air-flow in the test cages. It is suspected that in some of these mosquitoes the receptor for chemicals from a blood source may malfunction under a windless condition.

This beetle parasitoid, and microhymenopteran Spalangia are natural enemies of flies. Spalangia spp. play important roles in regulating the fly population in Malaysia. However, this role is doubtful for the spinylegged rove beetle due to its scarcity.

N2  - Tabanid flies were collected by four different methods (net-sweeping from cattle, cattle-baited trap, CO_2-lured mosquito-net trap and light trap) at a livestock farm in Shizukuishi-cho, Iwate Prefecture. In total, 21 species belonging to 5 genera were collected from May to September, with the biggest number of species and individuals in August. The number of flies caught per hour was biggest in net-sweeping from cattle, but least in the light trap. Species composition differed among the collection methods. Daily prevalence of flies, except Hirosia iyoensis, was similar between net-sweeping from cattle and CO_2-lured mosquito-net trap. Tabanus nipponicus was collected from June to September, the longest period. Collection of other species, however, was mostly made for 2 months. Flies were collected in day-time in May and September, from early morning to late evening in June and July, even at night in August. Daytime activity with a peak was observed in T. nipponicus and T. trigeminus, without clear peaks in Hi. humilis and T. rufidens, while Hi. iyoensis and Chrysops vanderwulpi yamatoensis were distinctly crepuscular species.

N2  - Effects of allethrin fumigation against organophosphate- and pyrethroid-resistant female adults of Culex tritaeniorhynchus were studied using commercial electric fumigators developed for the control of mosquitoes in human houses. Adults of susceptible Taiwan and organophosphate resistant Toyama strains were completely knocked down after 3min fumigation (0.05mg allethrin/min) in test chambers (0.504m^3). Only half of the pyrethroid resistant Chinen adults, however, were knocked down at 60min after treatment by the same 3min fumigation. One hundred forty minutes of fumigation is required in an ordinary Japanese room (23.3m^3) to reach the same concentration of allethrin in air achieved by 3min fumigation in a test chamber. This means that allethrin fumigation has significantly lost its effect in controlling the pyrethroid resistant mosquito adults. After 6min fumigation, KT_<50> for the Taiwan, Toyama and Chinen strains were 2.8,4.5 and 12.0min, respectively. Taiwan adults were completely killed by 3min fumigation, whereas the mortalities of Toyama and Chinen adults were only 65.6 and 28.1%, respectively, even after 12min fumigation. The possible development of pyrethroid resistance in Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which inhabits paddy fields, is discussed in connection with the increasing use of pyrethroid insecticides in these fields to control rice pests. It is also warned that the development of kdr-type pyrethroid resistance in this species makes most household insecticides totally ineffective, because they are almost composed of pyrethroids.

N2  - To examine the physiological age of Tabanus nipponicus Murdoch and Takahasi, terminal follicles in ovarioles and their dilatation after ovulation were used as criteria of developmental stages. Terminal follicles of newly emerged females were mostly in stage I. Unless taking a blood meal, females do not develop their follicles beyond stage II. Engorged females developed their follicles by rapid preservation of yolk and laid eggs 4 or more days after. Development of ovarioles represents the typical anautogenous pattern. Immediately after ovulation a distended follicular sac was formed in the distal portion of the ovariole and contracted to form a compact dilatation after 5 days. A follicular dilatation was observed in a ovariole of the female after the second ovulation, demonstrating that the Polovodova's method for estimating physiological ages is inapplicable to Tabanus nipponicus.

The terpenoid fraction demonstrated the alarm pheromone activity and consisted of neral (3,7-dimethyl-(Z)-2,6-octadienal, 60.0%), geranial (3,7-dimethly-(E)-2,6-octadienal, 18.9%) and nerylformate (3,7-dimethyl-(Z)-2,6-octadienylformate, 21.1%), among which only neral indicated a strong alarm pheromone activity (active at 10-100ppm). Nerylformate exhibited no activity at 1,000ppm and geranial was almost inactive at 1,000ppm tested. This is the first example that a glycyphagid mite possesses the alarm pheromone.

N2  - We examined susceptibility of larvae of Anopheles omorii to 19 insecticides including seven organophosphates, six carbamates, four pyrethroids and two chlorinated hydrocarbons by the larval dipping method. An. omorii has been established as a colony in 1988,and has not hitherto been contacted with any insecticide. LC_<50> values of fenitrothion, diazinon, parathion, fenthion and dichlorvos were 0.0073-0.019ppm. An. omorii was tolerant to malathion and trichlorfon. LC_<50> values of fenobucarb, carbaryl, metolcarb and propoxur were 0.0809-0.621ppm which were extremely smaller than those of xylylcarb and isoprocarb. LC_<50> values of permethrin (0.0102ppm) was the smallest among pyrethroids including phenothrin, allethrin and phtalthrin. LC_<50> value of pp'-DDT and γ-BHC was 0.0115 and 0.091ppm, respectively. An. omorii had the lowest acetylcholine-hydro-lyzing activity among all mosquitoes tested for comparison. Acetylthiocholine-hydrolyzing activity of An. omorii was similar to that of a susceptible strain of Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Larvae of An. omorii had the highest phenylthioacetate- and methylthiobutyrate-hydrolyzing activity among mosquitoes tested. Adults had low methylthiobutyrate- and phenylthioacetate-hydrolyzing activity. α-Naphthyl acetate-hydrolyzing activity of An. omorii had an intermediate value. β-Naphthyl acetate-hydrolyzing activity of larvae was the highest and that of adults was lower than those of all mosquitoes tested. Acetylthiocholine-hydrolyzing activity of larvae of An. omorii was inhibited by organophosphorus compounds including paraoxon, fenitroxon and dichlorvos. However, the degree of inhibition was less than that of larvae of a susceptible strain of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. This may be one of the reasons why An. omorii shows less susceptibility to paraoxon, fenitroxon and dichlorvos. Lower sensitivity of An. omorii to pyrethroids was not explained by the present results.

N2  - An improved floatation method with saturated sodium chloride solution for isolation of house dust mites was described. Dust samples were collected from the houses of asthma patients by a vaccuum cleaner. A portion of the fine dust that passed through a 36-mesh sieve and retained on a 200-mesh sieve was suspended in saturated sodium chloride solution in a 100-ml flask (0.1g fine dust/flask) for 30min. Although mites have been isolated only from the upper fraction of the floatation solution in the conventional method, the recovery rates were low (31.7% in average) and varied by samples. Hence, in our method the mites were isolated from the whole floatation solution, except the residue fraction, as well as washed from the flask wall (whole isolation method). The recovery rates rose to 92.3% in average. Isolating mites from the residue fraction was not practical as it is a time-consuming procedure. The isolation efficiency of the method was compared with that of floatation and centrifugation methods by using two mite-culture media prepared in the laboratory. One medium was a mixture of powdered rat food pellets and yeast extract (1 : 1,Medium A); the other, a mixture of Medium A and fine dust (1 : 10,Medium B). D. farinae had been reared on these media for 2 months. The recovery rate from Medium A was 89.4% in average by the whole isolation method. The rate did not increase by soaking the medium in 80% ethanol solution for 4hr. The accumulative recovery rates of 3-time centrifugations were almost same as those of the whole isolation method. The whole isolation method was considered to be more efficient, simpler and cheeper than any other method so far described for isolation of house dust mites.

N2  - Eleven species of the calyptrate muscoid flies were captured on the ships which were located at the ocean weather stations or voyaged on the Pacific Ocean and East China Sea. Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven and Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich) visited the weather ships at the stations which are located on the Pacific Ocean and East China Sea, 300 to 450km off Kyushu, Japan. Bengalia torosa (Wiedemann) was captured on a ship voyaged more than 100km from Taiwan where this fly is commonly found. These three species and Delia platura (Meigen) are considered to be transoceanic migratory insects, because they had more or less heavily damaged wings caused by a long-distant flight. The following 7 species, Lucilia cuprina, L. sericata, Musca domestica, Muscina stabulans, Atherigona varia, Lispe assimilis and Lispocephala miki, are considered to have moved with the ships, because they have had complete wings.

N2  - Mark and recapture experiments of blow flies, Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven and Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich), were attempted on Hachijo Island, Tokyo, in the autumn of 1983 and the spring of 1984 to investigate their seasonal migration. One female C. nigribarbis released at Station (St.) M (altitude 700m) in the moss forest of Mt. Hachijo-Fuji (854m) at the end of October 1983 was recaptured at St. 1 (50m) in the town at the end of November. At the end of March 1984,a total of 841 flies of both sexes of C. nigribarbis and A. grahami were marked and released at St. T (50m). One male and one female C. nigribarbis and one male A. grahami were recaptured at St. G (600m), St. 3 (400m) and St. 2 (200m), respectively, at the end of April. One female C. nigribarbis released on 24-25 May 1984 at St. T was trapped at St. 4 (600m) on 29 May 1984. The result of mark and recapture experiments confirmed the possibility that adults emerged in the town migrate from the lowland to the moss forest of Mt. Hachijo-Fuji before summer. Some of them most probably return to the lowland in autumn.

N2  - Fatal cases of pheasants, Phasianus colchicus var. tenebrosus, heavily infested with larval Neoschoengastia shiraii were reported. Seven pheasants of 3 to 4 months old, which had been raised at a mountainous area in Yamaguchi Prefecture, died after showing infirmity symptoms in September 1988. An autopsy was performed and an enormous number of yellowish papulae on the epidermis was found. In the central concavity of these papulae, a cluster of more than 10 individuals of chiggers was observed microscopically; these individuals were identified as N. shiraii. Histological examination of the lesions revealed that secondary bacteremia ascribable to hyperinfestation of chigger might have caused the death of the pheasants, in addition to chigger-derived toxemia.

N2  - The senior author visited Lake Toba, Sumatra, Indonesia, three times during the period from January 1987 to January 1989,for the collection of chironomid midges breeding in and around this lake. The adult midges resting or swarming around the lake were collected during the daytime with insect net or sucking tubes. The midges attracted at night to a battery-operated 6-watt white light were also collected with sucking tubes or insect net. A total of 101 adult males among the collections were mounted on slides with gum-chloral medium and identified. They were classified into 31 species, or 26 species of Chironominae (19 species of Chironomini and 7 species of Tanytarsini) and 5 species of Orthocladiinae (3 species of Orthocladiini and 2 species of Metriocnemini). Among these species, 20 are described in this paper as new species, and 3 among them are considered as to belong to new genera.

N2  - The oviposition, development and survival of Ixodes ovatus were studied at six different humidities (52,68,74,86,95 and 100%) and at 20 and 25℃. At both 20 and 25℃, egg production occurred at 86 to 100% RH, but the mean number of deposited eggs per mg body weight of engorged female was scarce at 86% RH; accordingly, the duration of oviposition was shorter than that at 95-100% RH. The preoviposition period increased with decreasing relative humidity. Hatching of eggs held at 100% RH and 20-25℃ averaged 57.2-63.8%, but reduced to 1.6-17.7% at 95% RH, and none hatched at 86% RH and below. At 95-100% RH and 20-25℃, 45.1-74.3% of engorged larvae molted, but none molted at 86% RH and below. At both 20 and 25℃, molting of engorged nymphs to adults occurred at 86 to 100% RH, but the percentage of molting success was few at 86-95% RH. Weight loss of engorged nymphs increased with decreasing relative humidity. Longevity of unfed larvae, nymphs and adults decreased considerably as the relative humidity was lowered. Unfed larvae and nymphs were less tolerant to desiccating conditions than unfed adults. These results suggest that I. ovatus is more susceptible to desiccating conditions compared with other ixodid ticks, and this would play an important role in the distribution and abundance of this species.

N2  - A survey of ixodid ticks on vegetations by a flagging method was made in the upper montane to subalpine zones (ca. 600-1,800m above sea level) of the Chichibu Mountains, during 1985-1986. Ten species belonging to two genera were collected in the upper montane to subalpine zones. Predominant species was Ixodes ovatus (38.0%), followed by Haemaphysalis kitaokai (22.5%), H. flava (15.3%), I. monospinosus (12.7%), I. persulcatus (9.3%), H. japonica (1.7%), I. acutitarsus (0.05%), I. tanuki (0.02%), and others. In comparison with the lower montane zone (ca. 50-500m above sea level), ixodid fauna of the upper montane to subalpine zones was very rich, reflecting high population density of big mammal hosts such as the Sika deer, Cervus nippon. The seasonal occurrence of four ixodid ticks, H. kitaokai (adult), I. ovatus (adult), I. monospinosus (adult) and I. persulcatus (adult and nymph) on vegetations was investigated in the upper montane to subalpine zones. I. ovatus adults and I. persulcatus adults and nymphs were frequently observed on vegetations from spring through summer, but disappeared in autumn. H. kitaokai adults and I. monospinosus adults showed two peaks of occurrence in spring and autumn.

N2  - Insecticidal and knock-down activities of fenvalerate optical isomers against the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, were determined. [S, S]-isomer showed about 4times higher insecticidal and knock-down activities than racemic fenvalerate. However, the insecticidal activity of [R, S]-isomer was only one-tenth that of racemic fenvalerate, and it showed no knock-down activity. [S, R]- and [R, R]-isomers did not show insecticidal activity. Electrophysiological study showed that only [S, S]-isomer was effective against the central nervous system of the insect. These results suggested that only [S, S]-isomer was the active component of fenvalerate. It was assumed that the insecticidal activity of [R, S]-isomer was due to [S, S]-isomer contained in the [R, S]-isomer sample as impurities or [S, S]-isomer isomerized from [R, S]-isomer in the body.

N2  - The habitat preference of domiciliary cockroaches in urban environments in Shanghai, China was evaluated with sticky traps. Residential houses (N=40), one-room restaurants (N=20) and hotel restaurants (N=8) were sampled with 1 sticky trap/15m^2,for 2 nights/month for 2 years. Blattella germanica was the most common (96%) species trapped in hotel restaurants, and Periplaneta fuliginosa was the most common (94%) cockroach trapped in households. P. americana was limited to 2-6% of the total cockroaches trapped in the three environments sampled. The one-room restaurant environment was intermediate in terms of heat, food, and water between the other two environments. B. germanica (76%) and P. fuliginosa (19%) were the most common species in one-room restaurants. The presence of German and smokybrown cockroaches in urban environments in Shanghai may be determined by availability of heat in buildings in winter, and abundance of food and water throughout the year. Hotel restaurants are heated in winter, and German cockroaches are common year round. Houses are not heated in winter and smokybrown cockroaches are most common during summer. In residences the number of smokybrown cockroaches trapped peaked in July 1987,and July and October 1988.

N2  - The distribution patterns of Leptotrombidium scutellare and L. pallidum, the vector species of tsutsugamushi disease, were surveyed with Tullgren's funnel method on the eastern slope of Mt. Fuji, Gotenba-Oyama District, Shizuoka Prefecture, in the autumn of 1988 and 1989 and in february, 1990. L. scutellare was shown to be distributed at well-drained sites at the foot of the mountain, and the specific habitat for this species was the sparse Miscanthus grassland developed on the sunny granular soilbed, which was sporadically seen in this district. But no evidence of recent spreads of such specific habitat was found coincidentally with the recurrent outbreaks of tsutsugamushi disease. L. pallidum was distributed in various types of habitats as previously observed in Nagano Prefecture, but the most common habitat for this chigger was the larger paddy banks that have recently been made during the paddy zone reconstruction program. Environmental changes brought about by the construction of many larger banks are thought to have contributed to an increase in vector population density and are probably responsible for the recurrent outbreaks of tsutsugamushi disease transmitted by L. pallidum. The larva of L. scutellare was observed not to overwinter, while the larva of L. pallidum was densely populated in both autumn and early spring of the next year. The chigger fauna of this district consisted of 16 species, inclusive of the 3 species that usually infest birds.

N2  - To clarify the tolerance of Aedes albopictus to burdens of Dirofilaria immitis juveniles, Ae. albopictus females were fed on dog blood of different microfilarial density, and the number of dead mosquitoes and the number of D. immitis juveniles in the mosquitoes were counted daily for 14 days thereafter. Most Ae. albopictus surviving the 14 days when D. immitis developed to the infective stage were infected with only less than 20 juveniles of D. immitis. The mortality of A. albopictus females was much higher after feeding on blood with a larger number of D. immitis microfilariae.

N2  - To elucidate the ecological role of prolonged quiescence in protonymph-pharate tritonymphs of the house dust mite, Dermatophagoides farinae, some factors influencing the induction, persistence and termination of quiescence were examined. When groups of 10 to 600 mites were separately confined in a shallow hole (2.5cm in diameter and 1.5mm deep) on slide glasses with culture medium and incubated at 25℃, 75% RH, the number of nymphs that became quiescent varied with the size of the inoculum; the larger the inoculum size, the more and the faster the occurrence of quiescent nymphs. Long-term survival of the mites was not achieved at both of lower and higher humidities than 75%, and only a few nymphs became quiescent. Termination of quiescence indicated by moulting to tritonymphs was accelerated when the quiescent nymphs were disturbed by separation from the substrates to which they had clung. Contact of the disturbed quiescent nymphs with water also enhanced the termination of quiescence. The quiescent period of undisturbed nymphs was estimated to be about 7 months at a constant condition of 25℃, 75% RH. Similarly, most of the undisturbed nymphs placed at ambient conditions in a house room since November 1988 moulted during April to May 1989. From these results, prolonged quiescence in protonymph-pharate tritonymphs of D. farinae should be regarded as "diapause" rather than to be in a temporarily quiescent state.

N2  - Development and hatching of eggs, and larval growth were investigated for Prosimulium yezoense Shiraki in Kyushu, Japan. The eggs, which were laid by a wild-caught female in the laboratory, were dormant from May to the following January, and hatching occurred from the middle of February at 14±1℃. The larvae appeared in the streams between February and May, and were considered to have eight instars based on the size frequency distribution of their postgenal length. The accumulated water temperature for larval development was estimated to be 603 degree-days.

N2  - Infective spots of Leptotrombidium pallidum naturally infected with Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (Rt) were discovered by exposing Microtus montebelli as sentinel animals on the ground at a corner of Hitsujiyama Park, Chichibu City, Saitama Prefecture, in November 1985. From a wild rodent Apodemus speciosus captured around the spots, engorged larvae of L. pallidum were collected and successfully reared by feeding on fresh eggs of Collembola. Four laboratory colonies (I-IV family lines) of L. pallidum positive for Karp type of Rt were established, and vertical transmission of Rt was examined from the parental generation (P) to F_3 in these family lines by isolating Rt from individual mites through the passage into mice. From F_1 to F_3 in 4 family lines, a total of 115 unfed larvae, 53 adult females and 51 adult males were examined for Rt. Only 6 males were negative and all the others were positive for Rt. The rate of transovarial transmission of Rt from P to F_1,F_1 to F_2,and F_2 to F_3 generations were 100%, and filial infection rates of their offsprings were nearly 100%. Spermatophores from infected males were examined for Rt and all of 78 spermatophores were negative for Rt. Furthermore, each of 7 Rt-positive males was mated with each of 7 Rt-negative females, and a total of 227 unfed larvae were obtained from these females. They were examined for Rt, but Rt was not isolated or detected from any of these larvae. From these results, the transmission dynamics of Rt was considered that Rt-positive males did not play any significant role in vertical transmission of Rt, but Rt was transmitted to the next generation only through eggs of Rt-positive females.

N2  - Ixodid ticks parasitic on horses grazing in 8 pastures in Aomori and Iwate Prefectures, northern Honshu, were examined during the years from 1987 to 1989. A total of 218 ticks belonging to 2 genera and 6 species (Haemaphysalis flava, H. kitaokai, H. longicornis, Ixodes nipponensis, I. ovatus and I. persulcatus) were collected, and almost all of them were adults. Dermacentor sp., which was recorded before World War II to be most abundant on horses in these prefectures in autumn and was referred to as reticulatus F., seemed to have been exterminated from these areas at present.

N2  - Seasonal changes in the hatchability of Aedes albopictus eggs of Okinawajima, Japan, was studied for a year in the field and the laboratory. The eggs laid in the period from mid-October to December were apparently different physiologically from those laid in January to September. Some of the embryonated eggs laid in mid-October did not hatch for 2 months of submersion period. As the photoperiod became short, hatchability was apparently low and it became clear that there were some diapause eggs laid in the period from mid-October to December.

N2  - The relationship between larval density of Anopheles sundaicus Edwards and several environmental factors was examined by 215 data which were obtained from April to June, 1982 in 38 ponds in a coastal village of North Sumatra, Indonesia. The data were analyzed by the quantification theory type I method. Density of the larvae was higher in the waters where fish were scarce, salinity was 0.5-0.8%, and/or the surface received much sunlight. Water salinity was most contributive to the density, followed by fish-abundance and sunlight condition. These three factors altogether contributed to 21% of total variance of the density. The contribution of fish-abundance suggested suppressive effect of predatory fish against the larvae in the field. Larval density of anopheline species other than An. sundaicus (mostly An. hyrcanus group) was much lower than that of An. sundaicus. When compared within other Anopheles group, the density was a little higher where water depth was greater (81-100cm), salinity was less than 0.4%, transparency was higher, and/or bloom of fibrous floating algae was luxuriant. Water depth was most contributive, followed by salinity, algal abundance and transparency. Contribution of these four factors altogether was 15% of total variance of the density.

N2  - Fifteen d-cyphenothrin-treated sound traps were set in a 2-ha orchard at Gertak Sanggol village in Penang, Malaysia, from August 5 to 18,1989,to determine the effect on an Aedes albopictus population. When the population size was estimated at pre- and posttreatment by the mark-and-release method and adhesive sound traps, 80.9% of females and 75.6% of males were found to be controlled from the field. Meanwhile, there was little change in the mosquito catches by an adhesive sound trap at an untreated area. The insemination rate of females sampled by net sweeping increased from 57 to 100% as more females were removed than males. Necessity of a middle-distance attractant was suggested to raise the efficacy of traps.

N2  - Trapping of both sexes of mosquitoes achieves more efficient control than manipulating the male population. For this purpose, various chemical and physical stimuli known to be attractive were reevaluated. Heat, black color, L-lactic acid, movement and sound were all attractive to both sexes of Aedes aegypti when tested individually under laboratory conditions. Black color, heat and lactic acid in this order contributed their attractancy in combinations with the other stimuli. In field tests at the fringe of a forest, however, only heat and sound proved to be of significant attractancy for female and male of Aedes albopictus, respectively. From these tests, it was suggested a powerful attractant from human emanations and optokinetic stimulus was necessary for further improvement of mosquito traps.

N2  - Some factors that affect the occurrence and termination of quiescence in nymphs of Dermatophagoides farinae, were examined. The mites aggregating on the rims and covers of culture bottles were collected when the mite populations were increased. They were kept at 25℃, 75% relative humidity (RH), without food. After 1 month, about 20% of the mites passed into quiescent state, and a half of them remained quiescent for 5 months at 25℃, 75% RH, and further 5 months at room temperature. Most of the quiescent mites were protonymphs. They were glued to the substrate such as covering filter paper. Quiescence in half of the 8-week-aged nymphs terminated when they were disturbed by being separated from the substrate, pretreated at 5℃ for 1 week, and then incubated at 25℃, 75% RH. But the nymphs did not moult by pretreatment of 10,18,and 25℃ for 1 week. The nymphs in age of 20-week or more moulted even when they were continuously incubated at 25℃ and 75% RH, if separation from the substrate was made. The moulting rates depended on age in the nymphs; the older the nymphs, the faster the moulting. However, the nymphs glued onto the substrate remained quiescent. Moulting of nymphs with age of 22-week or more was suppressed by incubating them at lower temperatures than 25℃, or lower than 55% RH. The contact of the quiescent nymphs with water for 3hr enhanced moulting even when they were incubated at 33% RH. These results suggest that quiescence in nymphs of D. farinae observed in the present study might also involve a very similar phenomenon to diapause.

N2  - An epidemiological survey on the vector mites of Tsutsugamushi disease was conducted in Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. On the Penghu Islands and Taitung of Taiwan, the only trombiculid mite belonging to the subgenus Leptotrombidium collected from rodents and insectivores was L. (L.) deliense, the potential vector of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi in the Asia-Pacific region south of Japan. On the other hand, on Mt. Alishan three species of the subgenus Leptotrombidium including L. (L.) kawamurai were collected from rodents, suggesting that the reservoirs of R. tsutsugamushi may be in this highland. On Okinawa Island, Japan, the trombiculid mite was not collected from rodents and insectivores in the present survey.

N2  - Mosquitoes were collected by light traps at a pigstay near paddy fields in Kochi, Japan, during 9 years from 1966 to 1974 and 8 years from 1982 to 1989. Major species were Culex tritaeniorhynchus (77.6%), Anopheles sinensis (7.0%) and Cx. pipiens pallens (15.4%) in 1966. However, the population size was gradually reduced especially in latter two species in recent 1980s. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was caught through the end of March to mid-October, and it showed a peak of occurrence in June and July in 1966 and subsequent several years. Six larval generations were estimated in a year. A high degree of correlation was observed between the number of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected from May to September during 1966 and 1973 and the total area of rice fields or the proportion of two-crop fields in Kacho Plain in this period. There was, also, a high correlation coefficient (r=0.949) between the number of vector mosquitoes collected and the number of Japanese encephalitis patients in Kochi Prefecture during the same period. The number of vector mosquitoes caught by light traps decreased abruptly from the end of August even when the temperature is around 25℃. This phenomenon was partly explained from the results of laboratory experiments in which phototaxis and blood feeding behavior of adult females were suppressed when the larvae were bred under day length of 10hr or less at 20 or 25℃. The vector mosquito was not found in caves and other places in Kochi Prefecture throughout the winter surveys. Japanese encephalitis virus was not isolated from three other species than Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected in winter.

N2  - Control efficacy of an agricultual acaricide, pyridaben, against three kinds of mite, Cheyletus malaccensis, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Tyrophagus putrescentiae, was evaluated by the filter paper contact method and the medium mixing method. Pyridaben is highly effective to C. malaccensis by the filter paper contact method. It killed C. malaccensis completely at a dose of 25mg/m^2. Pyridaben gave 100% mortality to D. farinae and T. putrescentiae at a dose of 100 and 200mg/m^2,respectively. By the medium mixing method, pyridaben kept more than 98% suppression of population growth against D. farinae at 100ppm during 6 weeks. The chemical was, however, relatively less active to T. putrescentiae by the medium mixing method. It showed 81.8% suppression of population growth against T. putrescentiae at a dose of 250ppm.

N2  - The prey-predator relationship between larvae of the mosquito Anopheles sinensis and nymphs of the dragonfly Sympetrum frequens in rice field areas was investigated in the suburbs of Omiya City, Japan, during the period from June to July of 1979 (for Area-A and the whole area) and 1980 (for Area-B), and July 1986 (for the whole area). The average density of S. frequens nymphs in Area-A (210a) and Area-B (430a) was 23-41/m^2 and 2-6/m^2,respectively. On the contrary, densities of An. sinensis larvae were very low in Area-A and high in Area-B. In both the areas, the density of S. frequens nymphs in a rice field was much different from those in neighbors. The precipitin test of the gut content of S. frequens nymphs with antiserum against An. sinensis larvae indicated that the proportion of An. sinensis larvae preyed by S. frequens nymphs was estimated to be 83.3 to 100% in Area-A and 0 to 87.5% in Area-B. The density of S. frequens nymphs in the whole area (97ha) was about 4/m^2 during the first half of June of 1979 and 1986. The distribution of nymphs in the area was contagious. On 17 June 1979,18.2% of S. frequens nymphs had detectable An. sinensis antigen in the gut, and 39% of An. sinensis larvae were estimated to be preyed by S. frequens nymphs during the day. An. sinensis larvae in the survey area could be controlled effectively by S. frequens through appropriate management of rice fields.

N2  - The distribution of larvae of Hirosia iyoensis was surveyed at the forest floor along a small branch of the Oyabe River of Toyama Prefecture. A total of 129H. iyoensis larvae was collected from leaf litter and soil at six different stations within 200m of the blood-sucking sites (a wide space opened at the main course of the Oyabe River) for H. iyoensis. Most of the larvae were collected within an 80m area of the blood-sucking sites. A total of 102 larvae was also collected at four stations with different altitudes (5,25,50 and 75m above the surface of the stream). The number of larvae collected tend to decrease in accordance with the elevation. This survey suggested that the breeding-places of larvae of H. iyoensis were the forest floor near the bloodsucking site of adults.

N2  - A 57-year-old woman experienced pain from foreign bodies in her oral cavity after eating raw squid. Examination of her oral cavity revealed 20-30 small foreign bodies embedded in the mucous membrane. After all the foreign bodies were pulled out, the pain was allayed and the wounds eventually healed. The foreign bodies, 5mm in length, were white and of elongated conical shape. Under microscopy, a large number of sperms was observed in the bodies. These foreign bodies were determined to be sperm-bags of the squid. It is supposed that this woman ate squid with spermatophores, thereafter sperm-bags were discharged from the spermatophores into her oral cavity. Although only a few similar cases heretofore have been found, it might increase among the Japanese who frequently eat raw squid.

N2  - Wide-mesh netting of 0.5cm mesh size was impregnated with each of five insecticides (permethrin, cyphenothrin, d-phenothrin, esfenvalerate and fenpropathrin) at various concentration ranging from 0.003125 to 0.025%, and the effect of netting on caged Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett was assessed. The mosquitoes were killed on contact with the treated net as they passed through. The mortality of mosquitoes was parallel to the concentration of an insecticide treated. The biting of Anopheles gambiae Giles on a rabbit caged in a net box treated with each of permethrin (0.6%) and fenpropathrin (0.3 and 0.6%) was also assessed. Most of the mosquitoes died before entering the net box, and the few that entered died before biting. Practical use of pyrethroid-treated wide-mesh bed net for preventing mosquito bite was evaluated from these results.

N2  - Altosid 10F[○!R], a slow-release formulation which contains 10% methoprene, was tested on the larvae and pupae of 8 mosquito species collected from Okinawajima, Japan : Culex quinque-fasciatus Say, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus Giles, Cx. fuscanus Wiedemann, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Ae. riversi Bohart and Ingram, Ae. daitensis Miyagi and Toma, Ae. iriomotensis Tanaka and Mizusawa, and Armigeres subalbatus (Coquillett). The residual effect of methoprene on Ae. albopictus was tested under 4 different conditions in the laboratory. The IC_<50> value for 1st instar larvae was 0.0017ppm against Ae. iriomotensis, 0.0120ppm against Ae. albopictus, 0.0176ppm against Ae. riversi, 0.0374ppm against Cx. quinquefasciatus, 0.0466ppm against Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, 0.0743ppm against Ae. daitensis, 0.0976ppm against Cx. fuscanus, and 14.9352ppm against Ar. subalbatus. The IC_<50> value for 4th instar larvae was 0.00006ppm against Ae. iriomotensis, 0.0009ppm against Cx. fuscanus and Ae. albopictus, 0.0012ppm against Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, 0.0013ppm against Cx. quinquefasciatus, and 1.2819ppm against Ar. subalbatus. The effectiveness of methoprene against Ae. albopictus persisted for a 7-month period when it was applied to the containers and left in a dry state in the laboratory. When methoprene was applied and left in the aqueous state, the percentage of inhibition of adult emergence was high, 85.5% for a 3-month period, but dropped to 39.5% after a 4-month period. When the containers were subjected to alternating aqueous and dry states, the inhibition of adult emergence was intermediate between the respective dry and aqueous conditions. When a container treated with methoprene was used successively for mosquito rearing, the effect of methoprene decreased within a short period, the inhibition rate being 36.5% after a 1-month period.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies were investigated collecting immature stages of flies from streams in 47 localities in Fukui Prefecture in the autumn of 1987. A total of 2,505 larvae and 989 pupae belonging to two genera and 17 species, three of which were unidentified, were collected at 44 sites. Seven species of two genera, Prosimulium (Prosimulium) kiotoense, Simulium (Eusimulium) konoi, S. (Simulium) suzukii, S. (S.) nikkoense, S. (S.) quinquestriatum, S. (S.) kawamurae and S. (S.) rufibasis were newly recorded from Fukui Prefecture. Three unidentified species were also new records from the prefecture. The predominant species was S. (S.) japonicum (27.6%), followed by S. (S.) aokii (13.3%), S. (S.) suzukii (13.0%), S. (E.) uchidai (10.0%), S. (S.) bidentatum (9.1%) and Pro. (Pro.) kiotoense (8.2%). The species most widely distribute from lowland areas to highland were Pro. (Pro.) kiotoense and S. (S.) japonicum.

Causative tick species were Haemaphysalis longicornis (adult female, 3 cases), Ixodes nipponensis (adult female, 1 case), H. longicornis (nymph, 1 case) and H. flava (nymph, 1 case). Tick bites were thought to have been acquired in mountainous areas in the 3 cases, while places of bite acquisition were not deducible in the remaining 3 cases. Recorded tick bite cases from Okayama Prefecture came to 10 examples, and Haemaphysalis ticks were found biting humans more often than Ixodes ticks.

N2  - A case-report of oral-stings by spermatophores of a squid, Tadorodes pacificus was described. The male patient was one of the authors of this report, aged 26 years, who was injured in his oral cavity immediately after eating uncooked internal-organs of a squid by mistake. He complained of severe pain and foreign-body sensation in the oral cavity. On examination, more than 15,small spindle-shaped stings stuck in mucous membrane of the tongue, soft palate, and upperlip. Stings were removed surgically in hospital, and they were identified as squid spermatophores by their shapes and containment of sperms. In addition to this case, two other cases with similar symptoms were identified as oral-stings by squid spermatophores. These cases suggest that fresh squids should be carefully prepared before eating them as "sashimi" or in raw.

N2  - Cattle-baited and poultry-baited traps, a modification of the steer-baited trap designed by Roberts (1965), were constructed and used for sampling haematophagous Diptera including large-sized Tabanidae and small-sized Ceratopogonidae. The width of the slit was much wider in the new traps (10cm) than in the Roberts' trap (1.9cm). When compared with a CO_2-lured mosquito-net trap, a cattle-baited trap collected more species and individuals in Muscidae, Culicidae, Simuliidae and Ceratopogonidae. As regards Tabanidae, however, the present width of the slit seemed a little narrow for these species to enter into the trap. A poultry-baited trap was also effective for collecting haematophagous Diptera attracted to and attacking hens.

N2  - Investigation was carried out on 48 different kinds of herb medicine in China and Japan for the purpose of isolating mite infestation. Fourteen families, 20 genera and 37 species, totaling 265 individuals of mites were isolated from 30 kinds of herb medicine in China. Among them, 16 species of Prostigmata and 14 species of Astigmata mites were obtained in the greatest numbers. Tarsonemus granarius was the dominant Prostigmata-species both in China and Japan. Haplochthonius simplex, Chryptostigmata, which is a household species, was abundantly obtained from Japanese samples. From the species composition obtained, it might be deduced that mite infestation of Chinese herb medicine occurs in storage houses.

N2  - Histopathological effects of an insect growth regulator, pyriproxyfen, on the larvae of Aedes aegypti were studied by treating with concentrations at 1 and 10ppb for 24 and 48hr. At the light microscopic level, vacuolation and inhibition of development of imaginal buds in various grades were seen. Electron microscopy revealed the lack of cuticular formation and vacuolation of epidermal cells. In the midgut and Malpighian tubules, disrupted mitochondria, abundant vacuoles and poorly-structured cytoplasmic organelles were observed. These findings suggest possible histolysis of the cells induced by pyriproxyfen.

N2  - Each volatiles from Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus consisted of unique mixtures of monoterpenoid, that is, D. farinae contained nerylformate, neral, and geranial as monoterpenoids, among which neral (28.2%) was the major component. On the other hand the volatile of D. pteronyssinus was composed of nerylformate, neral, geranylformate and geranial, among which geranial (36.6%) was the major fraction. Both species were also characterized by their hydrocarbon profiles. The D. farinae hydrocarbon consisted of pentadecane (32.2%), while that of the D. pteronyssinus was a mixture of heptadeca-(Z, Z)-6,9-diene (21.8%) and (Z)-8-heptadecene. Although these profiles may be useful for identifying each species, no behavioral responses against those volatiles were detected such as the alarm pheromone and aggregation pheromone found in other related mites.

N2  - In an attempt to predict the epidemic incidence of Japanese encephalitis in human population, a long-term surveillance on Culex tritaeniorhynchus, the vector of Japanese encephalitis virus, has been carried out at several observation stations in Toyama Prefecture since 1969. The numbers of the mosquito captured by the light trap had been decreasing since 1965 until 1977,and then began to reverse from 1978. This increasing trend appeared clear in 1982,although some decreases in the numbers were observed in 1984,1986 and 1988 in comparison with the previous years. The major cause of increase in the numbers of the mosquito may be attributed to the acquisition of insecticide resistance. Aerospray of agricultural pesticides or fungicides may not inhibit the appearance of the mosquito. In fact, the resistant/sensitive ratios for fenthion, fenitrothion and malathion of a resistant strain of C. tritaeniorhynchus, established in Toyama Prefecture, were 6,557,5,272 and 2,454,respectively. In an exposure experiment with the pesticide aerospray over a paddy field lethalities ranging from 7.6 to 71.6% were observed with the resistant strain of C. tritaeniorhynchus; these percentages could not be compared with the complete death of a sensitive strain.

N2  - Ovitraps were used to carry out weekly surveys of Aedes albopictus at 58 locations in the residential areas of Tokushima City. The eggs of Ae. albopictus were dominant in traps at all locations, and were found from May through early December. Egg density was particularly high in hillside areas. The mean number of eggs per trap sharply increased in July and peaked in early August. The percentage of ovitraps in which eggs were found was also high during this period. A clear correlation between the mean number of eggs and the percentage of traps infested was observed, especially in hillside areas.

N2  - Colonization of Toxorhynchites minimus has been successful for the first time in the laboratory, and the rearing method, lifetime, and oviposition behavior are reported. The average period from hatch to emergence was 26.8 days in females but 23.9 days in males under conditions of 26℃, 75% RH and L : D=14 : 10 hr and this difference was statistically significant. Even though abundant of larvae of Aedes aegypti were in constant supply as, cannibalism of Tx. minimus larvae was violent under a mass rearing condition, and finally only one individual survived. Individual rearing is therefore necessary. Artificial mating was required because natural mating did not occur in the laboratory. Unlike a conventional method of artificial mating, it was not necessary to remove the head of the male, but the result was quite as efficient. Oviposition started from the 9th day after emergence and continued up to at least the 52nd day, although it was most active in the third week. The hatchability was very high until the last oviposition. Eggs were projected into only a small hole bored at a node of cut bamboo or a stump. Oviposition was possible in a bamboo hole more than 2mm in diameter, but newly emerged adults could escape from a hole of more than 3mm diameter.

N2  - A field study to control the malarian vector, Anopheles farauti, with an insect growth regulator, pyriproxyfen (S-31183), was carried out in northern Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. An emulsifiable concentrate of 1% pyriproxyfen was applied to two breeding sites : one with fresh water and another with brackish water. Pyriproxyfen at a dosage of 0.1ppm inhibited emergence of An. farauti completely, at both test sites, for at least 5 weeks after treatment and the efficacy (more than 70% inhibition) lasted for ca. 2 months. The body color of the larvae and pupae in the test sites whitened noticeably after the application of the compound.

N2  - With behavioral auto-recording equipment the German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., and American cockroach, Periplaneta americana L., were demonstrated to actively enter into the radiation field of a 10W germicidal lamp. The daily mortality was examined for 4 days by releasing nymphs and adults into a constant temperature room with 2 or 4 germicidal lamps set near the floor. Foot traces printed on smoky papers under the lamp were also checked to confirm for their movement behavior. Adult American cockroaches tended to avoid intensive radiation from the germicidal lamp, whereas, nymphs and adults of the German cockroach and nymphs of the American cockroach were rather attracted to the radiation, resulting in high cumulative mortalities at the end of experiment. These results suggest a possibility of controlling cockroaches with the UV radiation emitted from germicidal lamps.

N2  - Larval chironomid faunae in a total of 66 water bodies at different levels of organic pollution were investigated. The number of species recorded and the diversity indices (Shannon-Weaver's diversity index H' and Pielou's evenness component diversity J') of the community usually showed significant negative correlations with the BOD. Pentaneura divisa and Brillia japonica, etc., Polypedilum pedestre and Paracladopelma camptolabis, etc., and Polypedilum japonicum occurred only in oligosaprobic (BOD<1), oligosaprobic to β-mesosaprobic (BOD<2), and β-mesosaprobic to α-mesosaprobic (1≦BOD<5) waters, respectively. Corynoneura lobata, Tanytarsus tamagotoi, Tanytarsus takahashii and Polypedilum asakawaense were dominant only in oligosaprobic lotic waters, oligosaprobic, β-mesosaprobic (1≦BOD<2) and α-mesosaprobic (2≦BOD<5) lentic waters, respectively. The relative abundance of Cricotopus triannulatus in a lotic community tended to be higher in α-mesosaprobic waters than in oligosaprobic or β-mesosaprobic waters. These results suggest that the diversity of a larval chironomid community, and the occurrence, dominance and relative abundance of some species can be used as excellent indicators of water quality.

N2  - Oviposition sites and the number of larval instars of two mountain blackfly species, Simulium japonicum Matsumura and S. rufibasis Brunetti, were investigated. The eggs of both species, which were indistinguishable from each other by egg size, coexisted on bryophytes growing on a water-splashed boulder. They were laid individually without making egg masses, and most of them were found lower than 5cm above water level. Two eggs of S. japonicum were also found on a partially submerged fallen leaf. Nine larval instars were identified in both species based on the measurements of head capsules of laboratory-reared individuals. The growth rates calculated from the size of head capsules between successive two instars were almost constant, i. e., a mean of 1.27±0.082 (S. D.) and 1.25±0.045 for S. japonicum and S. rufibasis, respectively. The oviposition habit of these species was discussed in relation to the habitat conditions.

N2  - Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes collected at Chinen Village, Okinawa, in 1987 and colonized in the laboratory were tested for resistance to insecticides. High resistance levels of the Chinen strain to organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate insecticides were similar to those of 16 samples in the 1984 country-wide survey in which no material from Okinawa was included. Extremely high levels of resistance to malathion and temefos were observed in the Chinen strain; the resistance ratio in larvae was about 10,000 for malathion and >125,000 for temefos. However, the Chinen strain was less resistant to fenitrothion, fenthion, and carbamates than the mosquitoes tested in 1984. The electrophoretic analysis indicated that the Chinen strain showed higher activity of carboxylesterases which hydrolyze β-naphthyl acetate than in the susceptible (Taiwan) strain. Therefore, the enhanced carboxylesterase activity was estimated to be a mechanism of OP resistance in the Chinen strain, although the role of acetyl-cholinesterases has not been analyzed. The Chinen strain was also resistant to pyrethroids with the resistance ratios of 50-1,000 for larvae. This finding was contrary to the results in the 1984 survey. When piperonyl butoxide was applied, LC_<50>'s of permethrin and cypermethrin for Chinen larvae were decreased by 1/3 and 1/23,respectively, but a considerable difference between LC_<50>'s for Chinen and Taiwan larvae remained in each of these pyrethroids. This indicates mfo's are not major factors regulating pyrethroid resistance in the Chinen strain. Application of an inhibitor of DDT-dehydrochlorinase (DMC) and an inhibitor of mfo's (sesamex) did not affect the LC_<50> of DDT for Chinen larvae. Experimental crosses of the Chinen strain with the susceptible (Taiwan and e ma) strains showed that pyrethroid resistance of the Chinen strain is regulated by genetically recessive factor(s). This indicates that kdr-like factor(s) might participate in resistance of this strain to pyrethroids and DDT.

N2  - The degree of sexual and reproductive isolation among three species of mosquitoes : Aedes riversi Bohart and Ingram, occurring in Okinawajima and Iriomotejima, Ryukyu Archipelago, and Tsushima, Kyushu, Japan; Ae. alcasidi Huang from Taiwan; and Ae. scutellaris (Walker) from Papua New Guinea, was evaluated by "hide-and-seek" tests and experimental crossings in the laboratory. The males of Ae. riversi from a given place could not discriminate females obtained from the same place. In a "hide-and-seek" test using Ae. alcasidi and Ae. scutellaris, all of Ae. alcasidi males which performed successful mating could discriminate conspecific females. The males of Ae. riversi and Ae. scutellaris could not readily discriminate conspecific females, and interspecific insemination took place. The crosses of Ae. riversi (Okinawa) females with Ae. alcasidi (Taiwan) males, Ae. scutellaris (Papua New Guinea) females with Ae. riversi (Iriomote or Tsushima) males, and Ae. scutellaris females with Ae. alcasidi males produced a large number of fertile hybrids. These hybrids were bred through to the F_3 or F_4 generation. The respective reciprocal cross was, however, completely sterile.

N2  - A new wet sieving method for isolating house dust mites from dust was developed by modifying the Furumizo method. In five successive sievings of samples collected by vacuum cleaners, the average proportion of mites isolated in the first three sievings to the total number was 98.4% (ranged from 89.5 to 100.0%) for live mites and 98.7% (90.8-100.0%) for dead mites. Recovery rates of 100 live Dermatophagoides farinae marked with Rhodamin B in each of four 500mg dust samples ranged from 84-95% by three times of sieving; and of dead ones, from 91-98%. This new method was superior to the Darling solution centrifugation method, as far as the isolation efficiency was concerned, when these two methods were compared among five samples each of 0.5g dust.

N2  - During the period from June to September 1987 field tests were conducted in Okinawa Prefecture to evaluate the efficacy of permethrin-impregnated ear-tags for controlling Musca conducens infestation to pasturing cattle. On June 6 two ear-tags impregnated with 15% permethrin were attached to each of all mothers of a herd of beef cattle in Minna Island of the Miyako Archipelago. The number of flies infesting the cattle body was counted twice in a pretreatment survey and then 8 times during the test period. A similar count was made on another herd of untreated cattle. A remarkable reduction in flies (mainly M. conducens) was noted among the treated cattle. Almost complete control was achieved after 18 days, and this state did not change through the remaining period of the test. The efficacy of ear-tags could be ascribed to the marked depending habit of M. conducens to the host in addition to high susceptibility of the fly to permethrin.

In paired feeding experiments, the BEECH strain of An. stephensi, selected as a reference, was fed simultaneously on the same mouse whenever An. omorii was fed. An. omorii was less susceptible than An. stephensi. However, An. omorii was much susceptible to P. y. nigeriensis than the other malaria vectors such as An. gambiae (16cSS strain), An. arabiensis (SENN strain), and An. dirus (BALM strain).

N2  - Malaria endemicity and the vector prevalence were investigated by using biting collections and trapping systems at a foot-hill malaria endemic area in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. A breeding basin, a stream-bed in a village Ban Tha Lam Yai, was selected as the study area. The buffalo bait caught the highest number of species (16 species) and individuals of anopheline mosquitoes; the number of individuals was 4 times more Anopheles minimus and 3 times more An. maculatus than that with the human bait. High parous rates of the two vectors throughout the year, 50% in September and 90% in May for An. minimus, 43% in October and 74% in March for An. maculatus, seemed to be participating in high infection rates of them and the stability of malaria endemicity in the village. The vectors were efficiently attracted to sound traps when those were combined with a hamster and dry ice. The number of vectors trapped was 3 times more than that with the human bait, but nearly a half of that with the buffalo bait. Sound traps segregated An. minimus into two groups according to the attractiveness at different sound frequency : one was 500-600Hz and another was 800-1,000Hz. An. maculatus was, however, attracted with a similar pattern to every frequency range from 350 to 800Hz.

N2  - Eleven species of tabanid flies belonging to 5 genera were observed to be attacking cattle during a survey of 1984-1985 at a center of an upland farming area in the Tokachi Plain where the Upland Farming Division, Hokkaido National Agricultural Experiment Station is situated. The flies appeared from middle July to early September with a peak season in early August. Tabanid flies collected by a survey of their breeding sites during 1984-1987 were four species from streams, three from swamps, two from forests, one from pastures, and two from arable lands. The aquatic species attacking cattle came flying from their breeding sites at least 1.5km apart. Tabanid flies were collected during 1984-1987 using a CO_2-lured mosquito-net trap at 34 spots in Tokachi District in early and middle August. The species composition was : Haematopota tristis 66.4%, Tabanus chrysurus 13.9%, T. nipponicus 7.0%, Chrysops suavis 4.5%, Hybomitra olsoi 2.8%, and other 10 species 5.4%. At the central plain the number of species was biggest (13 species) but the number of flies was smallest (55.7 flies/hr) among 5 divided areas of Tokachi District, with a marked contrast at the coastal area (9 species and 171.7 flies/hr, respectively). A total of 22 species of tabanid flies belonging to 8 genera have thus been recorded from Tokachi District.

N2  - The development, survival and oviposition of I. ovatus were observed at various temperatures (15,17,20,25,27 and 30℃) in the laboratory. Oviposition occurred at 17 to 30℃, but the mean number of deposited eggs per mg body weight of engorged female was markedly reduced at 30℃. The periods of preoviposition and oviposition were shortened as the temperature rose, except at 30℃. The egg hatchability was as high as 83-93% at 17-25℃, and was low at both higher (27-30℃) and lower (15℃) temperatures. The incubation period of eggs was shortened with increasing temperature. Engorged larvae and nymphs molted at 15 to 30℃, but the molting percentage was small at 30℃ in larvae, and at 15,20 and 30℃ in nymphs. The developmental zeroes for oviposition and eggs were 8.2 and 6.4℃, respectively. The developmental periods of engorged larvae and nymphs were generally shortened as the temperature rose, but temperature and the duration of development did not show a clear linear relationship. I. ovatus is less tolerant to low and high temperatures than the common Japanese haemaphysalids, Haemaphysalis longicornis and H. flava. This might be a factor that restricts the habitat of I. ovatus.

N2  - Pyriproxyfen (S-31183), a pyridyl ether compound, which shows high juvenile hormone mimic (JHM) activity against insects, was evaluated for activities against the German cockroach, Blattella germanica. Topical application of pyriproxyfen to last instar female nymphs induced higher inhibition of emergence than that by hydroprene. Last instar nymphs were the most sensitive to pyriproxyfen. High correlation was observed between the degree of inhibition of emergence of females and the inhibition of reproduction. Topical application or voluntary contact with pyriproxyfen caused the death of younger instar nymphs and supernumerary nymphs. Under laboratory conditions, a population of the German cockroach consisting of various nymphal stages and adults was exposed to harborages treated with pyriproxyfen at a rate of 3.8mg/m^2. Growth of the experimental population was suppressed, and the insects died off in less than a year.

N2  - A case report of eye-injury accidentally caused by the cervical gland venom from a snake, Rhabdophis tigrinus was described. The male patient was one of the authors of this report, aged 36 years, who was injured at his right eye during handling snakes captured for his laboratory work. About 5min after the accident, very frequent blinks followed by massive epiphora occurred in the injured eye. He recognized strong conjunctival injection with foreigh-body sensation in the eye. Irrigation with tap water had no effect, but repeated irrigation with a commercial eye-lotion reduced the symptoms. Three hours later, he could open the right eye, although corneal opacity disturbed his vision. Conjunctival injection disappeared within 4hr, but strong foreign-body sensation still remained. He was diagnosed at hospital as descemetitis with corneal opacity by the snake venom entered the eye. He was treated with chloramphenicol- and flavineadenin dinucleotide ointments. Clinical symptoms improved rapidly and disappeared within 3 days.

N2  - Experimental transmission of Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis to mouse (Balb/C) by bite of Anopheles omorii was conducted. Infected mice were exposed to a laboratory colony of An. omorii, TM-86 strain. After blood-sucking, the mosquitoes were kept in a nylon mesh cage with a piece of cotton soaked with a 3% sugar solution at 24±1℃ and 70% RH for a photoperiod of 15L : 9D including 1hr of controlled dawn and dusk. Four days after bloodsucking, a considerable amount of oocyst was formed on the wall of the mid-gut of several mosquitoes. Seven days after blood-sucking, formation of sporozoites in the oocyst was detected. From the 10th day sporozoites were observed in the salivary glands of the mosquitoes. From 11 to 15 days after blood-sucking, 1 to 3 normal mice were exposed to the infected mosquitoes. A total of 54 mice were tested, and 44.4% of them were infected with Pl. yoelii by bite of the mosquitoes. It was found that An. omorii was susceptible to Pl. yoelli and had the capacity for its transmission.

N2  - Organophosphorus resistant colonies of Culex pipiens molestus were collected from three sewage tanks of a building in Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, in April 1988. Several insecticides such as fenitrothion, dichlorvos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, fenthion, phenothrin and permethrin have been heavily applied to a tank since 1964. The LC_<50> values for 4th instar larvae and their resistance ratios (in parentheses) were : fenitrothion 1.01ppm (101), fenthion 1.08ppm (161.2), temefos 0.17ppm (212.5), malathion 10.1ppm (336.7), dichlorvos 1.25ppm (90.6), chlorpyrifos-methyl 5.7ppm (686.7), chlorpyrifos-ethyl 0.028ppm (164.7), diazinon 1.15ppm (35.9), propetamphos 3.3ppm (194.1), prothiofos 0.49ppm (8.4), propoxur 0.725ppm (1.84), permethrin 0.14ppm (14.7) and phenothrin 0.28ppm (32.2). High resistance to OP-compounds such as fenitrothion and fenthion may reflect the history of application of these compounds in the breeding site. High cross resistance was observed in temefos and malathion which have not been used in this breeding site. However, resistance to prothiofos, an asymmetric phosphoric ester, was low with the resistance ratio of 8.4. The larvae were also moderately resistant to pyrethroids, but they did not show resistance to a carbamate (propoxur).

N2  - Twelve enzymes (20 loci) were analyzed electrophoretically to investigate the genetic relationships among 8 populations of Anopheles minimus from 7 localities in Thailand. Seven isozymes, Aph-1,Est-2,Lap-1,Lap-2,Pgi, Pgm, and Xdh, were used to discriminate some minimus populations from the others. All of the populations seemed to be very polymorphic, especially the population from Tha Lum Yai, Kanchanaburi. The expected mean of heterozygosity of this population was 0.36. The populations with pampanai form and minimus form from Pu Toei, Kanchanaburi were more homogenous in the genome than the other populations. A dendrodram, based on the UPGMA method, of genetic divergence among the 8 populations of the minimus group proved Saraburi and Loei to be the local populations (Nei's genetic distance was 0.027). The others were lower than the subspecific level but higher than the local population level. This indicated there exist various grades of genetic divergence among the populations due to their evolutionary process.

N2  - Three experiments were carried out to determine whether blood meal size is related to mosquito size and to malaria oocyst production in mosquitoes. Anopheles stephensi (BEECH) and Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis (N67) were used in all experiments. Wing length was used as a measure of mosquito size, blood meal size was calculated using a ferrocyanide method and oocysts were counted under the microscope. Mosquito size showed a strong positive correlation with blood meal intake, though neither of these two parameters showed any positive relationship with malaria oocyst production in the mosquito stomach wall. The implications of these results for the transmission of malaria are discussed.

N2  - The degree of sexual isolation among three species of mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Aedes flavopictus downsi Bohart and Ingram, and Aedes riversi Bohart, occurring in Okinawajima, Ryukyu Islands was assessed by "hide-and-seek" tests and experimental crosses. The males of Ae. albopictus and Ae. f. downsi could readily discriminate conspecific females. However, under a non-choice condition, interspecific insemination took place. The cross between Ae. albopictus females and Ae. f. downsi males produced a small number of fertile hybrids. These hybrids were bred through the F_2 generation and appeared to be normal in every way. However the eggs from the reciprocal cross were completely sterile. Backcrosses of F_1 hybrids between female Ae. albopictus and male Ae. f. downsi to both parents produced partially fertile eggs, with the exception of Ae. albopictus males crossed with hybrid females. No insemination was observed in the Ae. riversi females crossed to either Ae. albopictus males or Ae. f. downsi males, as well as in the reciprocal crosses. Pre-and postmating isolation mechanisms were suggested to be operative among these 3 species.

N2  - Ultrasonic calls caused by three stimulations of "isolation, " "handling" and "electricity" in 7-to 30-day-old Rattus rattus and 10-to 30-day-old Wistar rats (R. norvegicus) were examined. FVgrams (ultrasonic diagrams compiled by a FV-converter) were available for analysis of long-time-recorded ultrasound produced by R. rattus and Wistar rat pups. Analysis with FVgram was based on wave frequency at "peak component" of ultrasound, duration of ultrasonic calls, and pattern grouping of ultrasonic calls. Distribution curve of wave frequency at "peak component" showed that younger pups in both rat species used higher frequency. It also showed that among 30-day-old Wistar rats, females emitted calls of higher frequency than males. Distribution curve of duration of the calls showed that older pups in both rat species produced longer calls. So far as pattern groupings of ultrasonic calls on FVgram are concerned, five different types were identified with possible meanings for ultrasonic communication among rats.

N2  - Allergenicity of the cockroach, Blattella germanica L. (B. g.), was studied by means of the following examinations, namely basophil degranulation (BD) test in rabbits and humans, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction in rabbits and rats, and prick test in humans. Also examined was the cross-antigenicity among the crude antigens of cockroaches and house-dust mites. Inhibition effect of several anti-asthmatic drugs on BD test in rabbits and humans was tested additionally. Inoculation of crude B. g. antigen into mice and rabbits produced specific IgE antibodies detectable by BD test and PCA reaction. Although the cross-antigenicities were seen among several kinds of cockroach antigens including the whole body antigens from B. g., Periplaneta americana, and P. fuliginosa, and from the feces and saliva of B. g., none of these cockroach antigens cross-reacted with the antigen from the housedust mite, Dermatophagoides farinae. Of the six fractions collected from the crude B. g. antigen through Sephadex G-100 column, F-2,with molecular weight of 25,000-45,000,showed the maximum activity in BD test in rabbits in IgE production in mice, and in the prick tests in humans who suffered from asthma. The effect of ca. 50% inhibition on BD in rabbits and humans was seen in aminophylline and ketotifen treatment each at (10)^<-3>M concentration. From these results, the BD test in rabbits proved to be one of the reliable bioassay methods applicable to the screening of anti-allergic agents.

N2  - At the Jos Plateau in Nigeria 11 species of tabanid flies belonging to 6 genera were recorded by collecting adults and larvae. Haematopota pallidipennis and Chrysops distinctipennis were dominant at the early stage of the dry season. C. distinctipennis was regarded as a candidate vector of loiasis in the area. Three patterns of daily biting activity were seen in tabanid flies in the rain forest; crepuscular activity in Ha. guineensis, midday activity in Tabanus conformis and T. secedens, and daytime actively in T. besti. Parous rate of the flies was extremely high in C. distinctipennis, Ha. guineensis and Ha. pallidipennis. This result suggests a possibility of autogeny.

N2  - This review aims to identify the factors, both genetic and nongenetic, which influence the susceptibility of mosquitoes to malaria parasites. The paper is divided into three sections. In the first, genetic differences in susceptibility between and within mosquito species, and mechanisms of refractoriness are discussed. In the second section, the effect of phenotypic factors such as mosquito size, blood digestion, nutrition, and the presence of other parasites are assessed. In the third section, the influence of insecticides and drugs is summarized.

N2  - Seasonal prevalence of a nuisance sphaerocerid fly, Leptocera fuscipennis (Haliday), was investigated using light traps placed both at breeding sites of the fly in the sewage sludge disposal site of Haneda (Tokyo International) Airport and at residential areas near the airport from May to November 1979. Frequent complaints from residents about flies had been made during the preceding two years. Therefore in 1979,619,000m^3 of sea water was applied to the breeding sites in total of 5 times from June 20 to July 27 to control flies before their mass breeding season. A large number of flies were captured in July and September at the breeding sites. Concentrated dispersal of flies to human dwellings occurred only in July. This happened at the end of rainy season between sunset and midnight when a northeast to southeast prevailing wind of 10-15m/sec blew. The number of flies captured in the residential areas, however, were far less than in preceding years and no more complaints were received from residents.

N2  - The expression of autogeny of Simulium aureohirtum Brunetti among three populations in the Ryukyu Islands was examined by maintaining newly emerged females on or without a sucrose solution. Mature eggs were produced only in the females fed on sucrose as early as three days after emergence at a temperature of 20℃. The mean maturity rate per fly was around 90%. Maturation of ovaries also occurred when flies were given a sucrose solution after one, two and three days of starvation. However, due to the increase in resorbing follicles, maturity rates were greatly decreased, especially after two and three days of starvation (to around 60-70%). Moreover, development time was retarded one day, as compared to that in flies fed on sucrose from the time of emergence. Fecundity (the number of mature oocytes per fly) was found to be positively correlated to the wing size within a population. However, the mean fecundity was not necessarily related to the mean wing size when different populations were compared.

The final collection site was selected from preliminary collections at 5 spots from July 8 to 9,1985. The annual total of the monthly mean numbers of the collected midges was 41,669 (male 15,795; female 25,874). Twenty-one species of 15 genera were collected, and the major species were Polypedilum arundinetum (14,254), Parachironomus arcuatus (5,234), Microchironomus ishii (4,622), Tanytarsus oyamai (4,057), Chironomus kiiensis (3,004), Tanypus punctipennis (2,490), Pentapedilum tigrinum (2,349), Polypedilum masudai (1,577), Polypedilum nubifer (980), Dicrotendipes niveicaudus (962), Cricotopus sylvestris (936), and Tokunaga-yusurika akamusi (526). Many species of adult midges emerged from June to September. Some species were abundant in the winter, and one species (Limnophyes hudsoni) showed two peaks in its prevalence, in spring and autumn.

N2  - Tabanid flies were collected with CO_2-lured mosquito-net traps at horse breeding farms in Shiraoi and Mukawa of Iburi District, Hokkaido, from mid-July to late August in 1980. Flies which attacked horses were counted at the same time. Sixteen species belonging to 6 genera were recorded in total, 12 species in Shiraoi and 14 in Mukawa. Tabanus nipponicus was the predominant species accounting for 72.5% followed by Atylotus horvathi and T. katoi in Shiraoi, and 33.8% followed by T. fulvimedioides, A. horvathi and T. sapporoenus in Mukawa. Flies were more abundant in early or late August than in mid-July seasonally, and more numerous in Mukawa than in Shiraoi locally : more than twice as many were trapped at the latter location. Diurnal fluctuations in the catch of flies between 9 : 00 and 17 : 00 were relatively small in Shiraoi, while the peak of activity was clearly observed between 9 : 00 and 12 : 00 in Mukawa. The number of flies trapped correlated with the number of flies which attacked horses.

An. farauti and Cx. quinquefasciatus showed a high degree of irritability (the response to external stimuli) to permethrin, averaging respectively 6.5 and 7.4 times higher than the control. An. maculatus showed a lower level of irritability to permethrin, averaging 2.7 times higher than the control. A graded response to increasing dosages of permethrin was shown by An. maculatus, but not by the other species.

N2  - Fourteen egg-batches of Hybomitra distinguenda (Verrall, 1909) were collected from 3 marsh plants, mainly Carex vesicaria L., in sunny places in Hokkaido from mid-July to early August. The eggs were laid on rather narrow and almost vertical leaves at an average height of 48.4cm above the water surface. The egg-batches were enamelled black in color, consisting of an average of 224 eggs, and elongate-flat in shape with 1 to 3 layers of eggs. Three egg-batches of Hy. takahasii Inaoka et Hayakawa, 1982 were collected from one marsh plant, Carex amplifolia, in shaded areas in Hokkaido in mid-August. The eggs were laid on rather narrow and upward-slanting leaves 49.7cm above the water surface. The egg-batches were black in color covered partly by greyish dust at the tips of the eggs, consisting of an average of 192 eggs, and roughly disk-like in shape with 2 to 3 layers of eggs. The eggs of Hy. takahasii were parasitized by wasps, but not those of Hy. distinguenda.

N2  - The newly synthesized pyridyl ether compound 4-phenoxyphenyl (RS)-2-(2-pyridyloxy) propyl ether (S-31183), which acts as a juvenile hormone, was evaluated for larvicidal potency against mosquitoes. The residual activity of three formulations, solubilized emulsifiable concentrate (SEC), wettable powder (WP) and granule (G), were compared under laboratory and field conditions. In the laboratory experiment, the granular formulation was most effective against the larvae of Culex pipiens pallens, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. Under field conditions also, the granular formulation was more effective both against C. pipiens pallens that are susceptible and those resistant to organophosphorus compounds than a WP formulation.

N2  - A colony of Anopheles omorii, which is a treehole breeder and is distributed in limited areas in Japan, was newly established in the laboratory. Eggs and larvae were reared in an insectary at 24±1℃ and 60% RH. Pupae and adults were kept in another insectary at 24±1℃ and 70% RH with a day-length of 17 : 7 (L : D). The first and the last 1hr of the daytime were simulated to dawn and dusk controlling with automatic gradual increase and decrease of voltages. Adults were kept in a nylon mesh cage of 30cm cube with a piece of cotton soaked with a 3% sugar solution. They easily mated in this cage. A mouse, restrained in a wire net, was provided once every 1 or 2 weeks for a blood meal. Eggs were deposited on filter papers attached to the inner wall of a plastic cup (6cm height, 9cm diameter) containing deionized water 2cm in depth. When the larvae hatched, shavings of cedar or fir were put into the cup to prepare good conditions for larval development in the same volume as the water in the cup. As food for the larvae, powdered food (liver and vegetables) and dried yeast were supplied once a day. The developmental period from egg to adult emergence was about 17 days under these conditions. Fifteen generations of the mosquito have been successfully maintained after 1 and half years in the laboratory.

N2  - The oviposition and egg development of wild female Simulium ochraceum were observed under various constant temperature conditions (15,18,21 and 24℃) in the laboratory. Forty-seven (55.3%) out of 85 blood-fed females successfully oviposited in small tubes; a mean of 82.5% of their mature ova were laid. Hatching occurred in 34 (72.3%) of 47 egg batches laid. Ovulation and egg development rates were more depressed at 24℃ than at lower temperatures. The rate of egg development became higher as temperature increased, with the mean time (±SD) required being 9.8±0.65,7.2±0.27,5.6±0.50,and 4.2±0.27 days at 15,18,21 and 24℃, respectively. Infection with Onchocerca volvulus larvae did not affect oviposition and fecundity of the fly. The fecundity correlated with body size (expressed as the cube of wing length) of the female.

N2  - An exceptionally rare case of airway invasion of a wingless female adult aphid is reported. The abdominal cut plane of the aphid was found in a histological slide specimen of left B^6 peribronchial tissue of a patient taken during a transbronchial lung biopsy. The patient was a 69-year-old male who had devoted his retirement time entirely to managing a green vegetable farm. Apparently one of the aphids inhabiting on a vegetable had accidentally invaded the patient's respiratory system during his normal breathing as he worked among the vegetables. Whether or not there is actual damage to the peribronchial tissue caused by airway invasion of an aphid is not yet clearly known.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies in Osaka Prefecture were investigated from various streams by sampling immatures at 24 sites in March 1987. A total of 835 larvae and 105 pupae belonging to 2 genera and 18 species were collected at 16 sites. Seven species, Simulium (Eusimulium) aureum, S. (E.) konoi, S. (E.) mie, S. (E.) subcostatum, S. (Simulium) kawamurae, S. (S.) quinquestriatum and S. (S.) rufibasis, were newly recorded from Osaka Prefecture, of which S. (E.) aureum was the new record from Japan. The predominant species was S. (E.) uchidai (29.9%), followed by S. (E.) subcostatum (16.2%) and S. (E.) mie (13.2%). The most widely distributed species was S. (E.) uchidai, followed by S. (E.) subcostatum and S. (S.) japonicum.

N2  - Chikungunya (CHIK) virus concentrations in the head/thorax, midgut and other abdominal parts were measured to compare virus multiplication in the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes aegypti and two strains of Ae. albopictus (Hyogo and Oahu strain) by plaque assay with BHK 21 cells. In Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, CHIK virus disappeared from the midgut by the 2nd days after feeding. In Ae. aegypti, CHIK virus was observed in 12% of the midgut for 2 weeks after infection. In the Hyogo strain of Ae. albopictus, CHIK virus was observed in 60% of the midgut for 2 weeks. CHIK virus was not detected in the other tissues on the 4th day after feeding. In the Oahu strain of Ae. albopictus, all the midgut specimens were positive for CHIK virus by the 7th day after infection. On the 7th and the 14th day after infection, CHIK virus was detected in the other parts than the midgut. Multiplication of CHIK virus in the brain, salivary glands, anterior midgut, posterior midgut and hemolymph was compared between the Oahu and the Hyogo strains of Ae. albopictus. Virus titers in their organs were clearly different between the two strains in parallel with the difference in susceptibility. Multiplication of CHIK virus in hemolymph was considered to play a role in disseminating the virus released from midgut cells to the other organs of mosquitoes.

N2  - Two Salganea species are found from the area of Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands. Salganea esakii Roth (1979) is a micropterous species restricted to the mountains of Kyushu and Yakushima Island which is situated south of the mainland of Kyushu. This species is very closely allied to Taiwanese S. gressitti Roth, but is distinctly larger in size. Roth (1979) believes that both short-winged species are also allied to the macropterous S. taiwanensis Roth which is treated in this paper. Salganea taiwanensis Roth (1979) is ranging from Taiwan to Amamioshima in the Middle Ryukyus. Upon a plentiful material I divided them into the southern race taiwanensis covering Taiwan and two Yayeyama Islands, and the northern race ryukyuanus covering Okinawa, Tokunoshima and Amamioshima. The latter race is larger in body dimension with slightly more developed phallomere of the male insect. 1) Body shining mat black, ♂21-29mm, ♀24-27mm (Taiwan), ♂23.8-29mm, ♀30-31mm (Iriomote Is.), ♂28.5-30.5mm, ♀26-31.5mm (Ishigaki Is.). The width of protergite does not reach over 10mm. In the male phallomere, L2D with undeveloped branch, R2 absent or, if present, only a short piece. Taiwan, Yayeyama Islands......Salganea taiwanensis taiwanensis Roth 2) Body black, tinged with brownish nuance. Body size ♂29.8-31mm, ♀30.8-32.3mm (Okinawa), ♀28-32mm (Tokunoshima), ♂♀30-35mm (Amamioshima). The width of protergite 9.5-12mm. In the male phallomere, L2D with its branch well developed with pointed ends, R2 is a stick with or without hooked apex. Amamioshima, Tokunoshima, Okinawa (main island)......Salganea taiwanensis ryukyuanus subsp. nov.

N2  - A subcutaneous bird-parasitic blowfly, Trypocalliphora braueri (Hendel) was discovered in Hokkaido, Japan. Two larvae were found under the skin of the head of a nestling of Emberiza spodocephala. The fully mature larvae caused tumorous swellings and the subcutaneous cavities measured 11mm in depth and about 3mm in diameter. The larvae pupated 2 days after removal from the cavities, and the adults emerged 8 days after pupation. T. braueri is newly recorded from Japan and E. spodocephala is a new host record for the species.

Two species of the genus, P. kiotoense and P. yezoense, were confirmed in the mountainous regions of the island. The former species was found at Mt. Sefuri, Mt. Hikosan, Yabakei, Mt. Sobo-Mt. Katamuki and Mt. Ichifusa, while the latter was restricted to the Mt. Sobo-Mt. Katamuki area. A clear difference in seasonal prevalence was noted between the two species, though both were univoltine : the larval stage of P. kiotoense was from November to March while that of P. yezoense was from February to May.

N2  - The breeding of Anopheles sundaicus, together with topography and land use, was investigated from 1980 to the first half of 1985 in a coastal village of North Sumatra, Indonesia. The major breeding places were sunlit flood fields, ditches for coconut cultivation, small fishponds and roadside pools situated in the high-salinity stagnant water areas which were subject to tidal action of spring tides. Unfavorable places for breeding of the species were tidal swamps subject to daily tidal action, water bodies densely covered with trees and shrubs, rice fields, and fishponds situated in the stagnant water areas with low salinity of less than 0.1%. Floating algae and aquatic plants were sometimes found with the larvae in waters of less than 1.0% salinity. Usually, however, the larvae were abundant in those of more than 1.0% salinity without aquatic plants. Favorable breeding places were distributed in limited areas even just after onset of one of spring tides in May 1985.

N2  - Effectiveness of collecting tabanid flies using carbon dioxide as an attractant was tested by regulating the gas volume from 0 to 3,000 ml/min in a mosquito net trap at a horse-breeding farm in Aomori Prefecture. Abundant species collected were Tabanus nipponicus, T. trigeminus, T. rufidens, T. kinoshitai and T. fulvimedioides which accounted for 85.4% of the total number. The number of flies attracted increased almost linearly with the increase of gas volume between 0 and 750ml/min. Maximum numbers were collected at a volume of 1,500ml/min, though the attractiveness did not change greatly beyond the volume of 750ml/min. Smaller species such as T. kinoshitai showed a tendency to be attracted by a lesser volume of carbon dioxide, compared to the larger species such as T. rufidens.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of blackflies (Simuliidae : Diptera) in Shizuoka Prefecture were investigated by collection of larvae and pupae. The survey was conducted at 74 sites in July-August of 1985. A total of 16 species comprising 577 pupae and 6,247 larvae were captured from 63 sites. Two species, Simulium aureohirtum and S. yonagoense were newly recorded from this prefecture. Predominant species was S. japonicum (29.5%), followed by S. bidentatum (22.1%) and S. uchidai (9.7%). S. japonicum was collected in the mountain district of the northern part of Shizuoka Prefecture and the western part of the Izu Peninsula. S. arakawae distributed in lowlands at the west of the Ohoi River and was segregated from the distribution of S. aokii which ranged at the east of the river especially in the Izu Peninsula.

N2  - The blood-meals of two major Simulium species of Hokkaido, Japan were examined immunologically by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in order to determine the blood source animals of the blackflies. The sources of blood-meals were determined in 59 individuals out of 740 S. japonicum and 44 individuals out of 161 S. rufibasis. The blood-meals of S. japonicum reacted with anti-human, -bovine, -horse, -sheep and -sika deer sera and those of S. rufibasis showed positive reaction to anti-bovine, -horse and -human sera. None of the blood-meals reacted with anti-birds serum. The two blackfly species have S-type tarsal claws and flies belonging to this group are generally considered to be mammalophilic blood suckers. The results obtained in this study provide solid support for this theory.

N2  - The seasonal appearance of immatures of Aedes togoi (Theobald) was monitored from January 1979 to January 1980 at their breeding sites of rock holes along the Gushikami coast, Okinawa Prefecture. Large numbers of the immatures were observed from May to June at expanded breeding sites. The density of the immatures was very low from July to December, but even in winter all the immatures were present. It was found that the number of immatures was closely related to climatic conditions such as rainfall, temperature and attack of typhoons.

N2  - Studies on control effect of the permethrin-impregnated mosquito net against Anopheles farauti, the malaria vector species in the Western Pacific countries were carried out in Solomon Islands in 1985,using the experimental hut attached with the exit window traps. Average mortality rate of the mosquitoes entering the hut was 88.2% for a net treated with 0.5g/m^2 and 84.0% for a net treated with 0.2g/m^2 of permethrin. Mortality rate when the mosquito net was hung with a gap at the bottom was slightly higher than when the net was completely closed, showing 90.2% and 85.1%, respectively. Sixty-nine point nine percent and 71.9% of all mosquitoes that entered the 0.5g/m^2-net hut and the 0.2g/m^2-net hut, respectively were caught in the exit window traps, and mortality rates after 24hr were 84.1% and 79%. In case of the control (untreated mosquito net), 98.4% of the mosquitoes was collected at the exit window traps. The permethrin-impregnated mosquito net did not show any repellent effect, because there was no reduction in the number of the mosquitoes entering the treated hut compared to the control hut (76.5 females/night in the 0.5g/m^2-net hut, 69.5 females/night in the 0.2g/m^2-net hut and 61 females/night in the control hut). It was found that permethrin has the fumigation effect, showing that the mortality rate of the caged An. maculatus females which were hung 30-40cm apart from the permethrin-impregnated mosquito net was 89.9%, 90.0%, 94.9% and 100% at 1.5hr, 3hr, 6hr and 12hr of exposure, respectively.

N2  - To further improve the efficiency of sound traps, 4 different types of traps were tested on Culex tritaeniorhynchus in a paddy and Aedes albopictus in a woods. A black-painted, board speaker trap, 53×73×1cm, which was set vertically and emitted a 400-Hz sound, caught as many males of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus as a large cup trap and a previous, standard cylinder trap did. However, a board trap caught more unfed and gravid females than others when all were set near a pigpen. The board speaker trap also caught significantly larger numbers of Ae. albopictus females than other traps. This higher attractancy was attributed to its features of sound being emitted from the entire speaker surface, and its visibility to flying mosquitoes. Continuous 8-day trapping of Ae. albopictus with 5 traps of 3 types on each day almost decimated the male population in the woods of 15×100m.

N2  - From 1983 to 1987,vertical distribution of trombiculid mites fed on small rodents was surveyed at six sites of different heights on Mt. Hakusan (2,702m above sea level) in Ishikawa Prefecture, which is preserved as a national park. A total of 1,605 mites belonging to four genera and 13 species were found from 21 rodent hosts belonging to four genera and five species. Host animals and mite species were more abundant in the forested habitat below 1,200m than in the higher zones. Mt. Hakusan was regarded as the westernmost distribution of Neotrombicula microti in Japan, which was found at the 2,200m level. The population of N. nagayoi was composed of both the original and variant types. Furthermore, based on present information of the morphological characteristics and geographical distribution throughout central-northern Japan, the so-called Leptotrombidium miyazakii group including three variants may be reasonably represented by the two species, L. owuense and L. miyazakii, as each one was originally described.

N2  - Entomogenous nematodes, Steinernema feltiae (ALL and Mexican strains), S. bibionis, S. glaseri, and Heterorhabditis heriothidis were evaluated for their infectivity to larvae of a Japanese species of flesh fly, Boettcherisca peregrina by the contact method with nematode suspension. The 3rd instar larvae of B. peregrina were forced to contact with a suspension of infective larvae of nematodes for 48hr and the mortality of treated insects calculated from adult fly emergence was determined. Both strains (ALL and Mexican) of S. feltiae and S. bibionis were most infective to B. peregrina larvae, followed by H. heriothidis, whereas S. glaseri showed no significant infectivity to larvae of the fly. To investigate the effect of temperature on infectivity of nematodes, the 3rd instar larvae of B. peregrina were incubated with a suspension of nematodes at 5 different temperatures between 15 and 35℃ for 48hr. S. feltiae (ALL and Mexican strains) were most infective at 25 and 30℃, less infective at 30℃, and showed no remarkable activity at 15 and 35℃. Loss of S. feltiae infectivity at 35℃ was due to death or weakening of nematodes at higher temperature. Loss of infectivity at 15℃, on the contrary, was caused by immobility of nematodes at lower temperature. Housefly (SRS strain) larvae were reared in a medium containing S. feltiae (ALL strain) for evaluation of its infectivity. The 2nd instar housefly larvae were placed on standard barley bran media with infective larvae of the nematode and adult fly emergence was subsequently observed. S. feltiae almost completely inhibited house fly emergence at a concentration of (10)^5 per 100g larval medium.

A total of 3,567 adult females belonging to 5 genera and 13 species were collected. Haematopota tristis was the most predominant occupying 86.6% of the total catch, then followed by Hybomitra olsoi (4.4%), Tabanus chrysurus (3.8%). T. nipponicus (2.1%), Chrysops suavis (1.2%) and Hy. borealis (0.9%). Hy. takahasii, a very rare species, was collected at Kamioboro and Kiritappu. Mass occurrence of Ha. tristis was observed at the forest areas of Kamioboro, Lake Notoro and Lake Chimikeppu.

N2  - A recurrence of tsutsugamushi disease in 1983 in Saga Prefecture, western Kyushu, Japan, led us to survey the vector of the disease and antibodies against Rickettsia tsutsugamushi among wild rodents and inhabitants in the prefecture. In the foothills of four different areas, a total of 185 wild rodents (all Apodemus speciosus, except for 3 individuals of A. argenteus) were captured alive between October 1984 and October 1985. From these rodents, a total of 10,456 trombiculid mites of 11 species were collected. Leptotrombidium scutellare and L. pallidum, known vectors of tsutsugamushi disease in Japan, were confirmed. The former was found from October through March, while the latter was collected from November through May. This seasonality coincided with the occurrence of tsutsugamushi disease from fall through spring in Saga Prefecture. Wild rodents having antibodies against R. tsutsugamushi were present throughout the year. Detection of antibodies from 2.6% of the inhabitants suggests the presence of unreported cases of infection with R. tsutsugamushi in Saga Prefecture.

N2  - Breeding sites, species composition and seasonal prevalence of tabanid flies were studied along the basin of the Horobetsu River, Hokkaido in 1976 and 1977. The adult flies were collected with CO_2-lured mosquito-net traps which were set at 3 sampling sites along the midstream of the river from early July to middle September. Larval collections were made at their suspective breeding habitats. Aquatic or semi-aquatic breeding sites yielded 10 species of larvae, of which 5 were from streams, 2 from ponds, and 7 from paddy fields. Terrestrial breeding sites yielded 5 species of larvae, of which 5 were from grasslands, and 3 from forests. Eighteen species were collected by the survey of adults. Tabanus nipponicus was the predominant species occupying 56.3% of the total flies, followed by T. chrysurus (15.0%) and T. trigonus (6.2%). Abundant occurrence of T. trigonus at an area was unusual for Hokkaido. The tabanid fauna of the surveyed area was similar to those in the Oshima Peninsula, Hokkaido, and the Tohoku District, Honshu. The number of species and individuals of tabanid flies in the surveyed area was most abundant in August. Seasonal prevalence of Hirosia sapporoensis, T. trigonus and T. katoi was observed for the first time in Hokkaido.

N2  - Meteorological analysis of the 1967-1975 mosquito survey in Izumi-Mibayasi area of Osaka Prefecture revealed that the day of first appearance of overwintered females of Culex tritaeniorhynchus was strongly correlated with the cumulative temperature (day-degree) from February 21 to March 31. Most of the overwintering mosquitoes seemed to have completed diapause at latest by late February in this area. But, the first appearance of the-mosquitoes delayed in years when the cumulative temperatures during this period were less than 335. 1 daydegrees, and the mosquitoes began to be attracted to a dry ice trap when temperature at sunset was above 13℃ or mean daily temperature was above 14.5℃. Flight activity of the mosquitoes was also inhibited when the days in which mean daily temperature was below 14.5℃ increased in early or mid April.

N2  - The presumption that Leptotrombidium pallidum, the most probable vector trombiculid of tsutsugamushi disease in Nagano Prefecture, would occur in the vicinity of patients' houses and would constitute a source of infection was determined by the following procedures. Housing lots including the rear and front gardens, the sides of pathways, grasslands, cultivated or abandoned fields and banks of these fields were selected in the neighbourhood of the houses of seven patients who contracted the diseases in 1986. From the selected spots with living signs of wild rodents, 10 or 15 soil samples, each with a volume of ca. 2,000(cm)^3,per one patient's housing area were taken and examined for the presence of chiggers by the Tullgren's funnel method. The samplings were carried out during the period from November 17 to December 3,1986. L. pallidum larvae were frequently found from the samples taken at the housing lots and paddy banks close to the patients' houses. No appreciable differences were observed between the environmental conditions of these patients' houses and non-patients' ones. The possibility that such penetrating distribution of vector trombiculid as observed in this study is common in other endemic foci was suggested as an alarm for the prevention of tsutsugamushi disease.

N2  - Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate the potential activity of diflubenzuron, an insect growth regulator, to control cockroaches. In first-instar nymphs of Blattella germanica, 100% mortality was obtained with filter-paper harborages treated with a water suspension of 20ppm or more active ingredient (a.i.) concentration. However, the nymphs fed on animal-food powder containing 100ppm a.i. were not killed completely. The effects of diflubenzuron residually applied to harborages were also demonstrated against first-instar nymphs of Periplaneta americana as well as against final-instar nymphs of B. germanica. Topical applications to final-instar nymphs of B. germanica were also effective. The age of the greatest sensitivity of first-instar nymphs of P. americana was about 4 days before ecdysis, and that of final-instar nymphs of B. germanica was from 3 to 6 days before their final ecdysis at 26℃, during which a single-day exposure to treated harborages was enough to kill them all. The exposure of parent cockroaches to treated harborages showed substantial ovicidal effect in B. germanica.

N2  - The effect of relative humidity on the oviposition and development of Haemaphysalis longicornis and H. flava was studied under laboratory condition at 25℃. Pre-oviposition period of H. longicornis was little influenced by the humidity, while that of H. flava was longer at 90% than at 100% R. H. H. longicornis deposited eggs in all humidities from 100% down to 52%, though the mean egg number per mg body weight reduced with decreasing humidity. No eggs hatched at humidities lower than 68%. Neither egg deposition nor hatching occurred in H. flava at humidities lower than 68%, and the mean egg number was smaller at 90% than at 100%. Engorged larvae of both species were little affected in subsequent development when kept under higher humidities of 100 and 90%, but could not molt below 74%. At 90% R. H. the molting rate was higher in H. longicornis larvae than in H. flava. The nymphs of H. longicornis could molt at all humidities from 100% down to 52%, but the molting rates was reduced as the relative humidity decreased. The nymphs of H. flava could not molt at humidities below 74%. The developmental period of engorged nymphs of H. longicornis gradually prolonged with decreasing humidity, whereas that of H. flava markedly prolonged at 90%, the lowest humidity inducing molt for this species. The longevity of unfed adults and nymphs did not differ between the two species, and was shortened with decreasing humidity. These results suggest that H. flava is less tolerant to low humid conditions than H. longicornis.

N2  - Two species of the cockroaches of the genus Trichoblatta were described and illustrated. T. pygmaea (Karny) was now revealed to range from the southern extreme of Kyushu to Taiwan through the islands of the Ryukyus. This species is found under barks and gathering on the fungi. T. nigra (Shiraki) has been known as a Taiwanese insect, but it was discovered from Ishigaki Island (♀) in 1982 and from Iriomote Island (♂) in 1986,both islands belonging to the Yayeyama Group close to Taiwan.

N2  - Insecticide resistance of houseflies inhabiting the third "Yumenoshima" in Tokyo Bay was further studied. In this dumping-island the applications of a fenthion-dichlorvos mixture were replaced by the reciprocal ones of a fenitrothion-tetramethrin mixture and prothiofos since 1980. In 1978-1986 period, the resistance ratios at LD_<50> for several OP compounds were 50-131 for dichlorvos, 133-557 for fenthion, 122-3,397 for fenitrothion, 514-2,044 for diazinon and 592->1,667 for malathion. However, resistance to prothiofos was low with the ratios of 1.6-5.2 at LD_<50>. With regards to pyrethroids the resistance levels were either low or intermediate : the highest resistance ratio was 24.4 for tetramethrin, 15.4 for allethrin, 5.16 for resmethrin and 6.6 for permethrin. The results of experiments with DDT synergists (Sesamex and DMC) suggested that the kdr factor for high resistance to both pyrethroids and DDT may not be present in the third "Yumenoshima" colony.

N2  - The Japanese cockroach species of the genus Panesthia are revised. Since Matsumura's brief record (1898)"Panesthia angustipennis Illiger" has been listed in Japanese literature without any precise taxonomic treatment. On the other hand, "Cryptogercus (sic) spadicus Shiraki (1906), " which is nothing but an immature larva of the same species, also remained without further consideration until Roth's revision (1979) of this genus. In the present revision the Japanese and Taiwanese representatives of the "Panesthia angustipennis-Group" are investigated. The Panesthia species of the Yayeyama Islands which is characterized with reddish marked larval insects is now separated as P. angustipennis yayeyamensis ssp. nov., the similar larval insects are being also found in Taiwan.

N2  - A laboratory colony of Leptotrombidium (Leptotrombidium) pallidum infected with Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, was derived from a single field-collected mite. Transovarial transmission of R. tsutsugamushi through the first generation (F_1) of this trombiculid mite was demonstrated. The filial infection rate was 100%, and all the adult males were infected with R. tsutsugamushi. This finding in R. tsutsugamushi-infected colony of L. pallidum was characterized by the high ratio of the male among F_1 progenies and 100% filial infection rate of males, which was contradictory to those in the other R. t.-infected species of chigger mites.

N2  - The wingbeat frequency of female Culex (Cx.) tritaeniorhynchus was firstly determined to be 329.0Hz on average and the male's to be 570Hz. Collection of females was then done by various combinations of trapping systems, wingbeat sound of different frequencies, hamsters and/or dry ice. Acoustic responses of the female mosquitoes were lower at 300 and 350 Hz and higher at 500 to 800 Hz. The lowest response was below the level of the soundless trap and the highest response was gained at 600 Hz. A control cage trap with a hamster caught more females than a cylinder trap with a speaker emitting a wingbeat sound. The seasonal prevalence of the mosquitoes was shown by the trapping system. Females were trapped at places far from the breeding site of the species.

A total of 138 individuals belonging to 2 genera and 6 species were collected. Tabanus nipponicus was the most predominant species accounting for 49.3% (68 indiv.) followed by Chrysops suavis (37.7%, 52 indiv.). Individuals of other species collected were few in number. The largest number of species and individuals were collected in August (5 species, 104 indiv.), with fewer in June (2 species, 17 indiv.) and July (3 species, 17 indiv.). Chrysops japonicus was collected for the first time from Okushiri Island.

N2  - Seasonal fluctuations in the egg production of the giant African snail, Achatina fulica, the growth of the snail and the rate of infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis in relation to the size of the snail were studied on the Amami Islands. Two clear peaks in the egg production were observed in June and in October/December. Almost all the eggs and infants produced in the latter period died from the cold. The effective reproduction season, therefore, was assumed to be around June. Infant snails grew rapidly to 50-70mm in shell height and then leveled off. The infection rate with A. cantonensis rose rapidly in snails over 50mm in shell height, namely from 11.7 (20-49mm) to 67.9% (50-89mm)

N2  - An insect growth regulator diflubenzuron was applied to the Kokawa River at the concentration of 1.25ppm for an hour to control simuliid larvae (Ogata et al., unpublished). On that occasion, the effects of the chemical on both invertebrate communities and fish were assessed. Weekly sampling of invertebrates and fish was conducted till the 4th week after the application in both treated and untreated region. Most of invertebrates were eliminated within 2 weeks, while Hydropsycidae died out gradually. Adults of Elmidae, which had not found before, appeared 1 week after in large number at the uppermost of the treated region. Fast recovery of Baetis at the same place was recognized. Downstream drifts from untreated region accounted for this result. While recolonizations by newly hatched larvae of Baetis, Chironomidae, Antocha and Simuliidae were prominent 3-4 weeks after in all the treated region. These fast recolonizers reached abnormally higher densities. On the other hand, most of caddisflies and mayflies had not recovered by the 4th weeks. Since application of diflubenzuron induces an enormous increase in target dipteran larvae including simuliids, once this chemical is used in a river, frequent applications are required subsequently. No fish mortality was observed on Phoxinus lagowski f. steindachneri and Leuciscus hakonensis. Both adults and fry of the former were commonly found during the study periods. Their condition factors increased after the application, suggesting that this species fed on attached algae which became abundant in the treated region.

N2  - The newly synthesized pyridyl ether compound 2-[1-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy) ethoxy] pyridine (S-31183), which acts as a juvenile hormone, was evaluated for larvicidal potency against the larvae of six strains of the housefly, Musca domestica. S-31183 showed higher larvicidal activity against pyrethroid and organophosphorus resistant houseflies than methoprene or diflubenzuron in the laboratory, and showed promising results under the semi-field conditions.

N2  - Soil samples were taken monthly at 7 stations, 4 in Matsumoto and 3 in Miasa, Nagano Prefecture, and examined for the presence of trombiculid mites by the improved Tullgren's method during the period from June 1985 to May 1986. Additional examinations were continued until October 1986 at 1 each station in the 2 areas. Trombiculid fauna and density of each species varied according to the differences in vegetation and soil nature of the stations surveyed, indicating definite dependency of trombiculids on these environmental factors. Stations in grasslands of Miscanthus and Artemisia, which were newly formed on abandoned fields and abounded with tunnel networks made by field rodents, as well as stations in the similar grasslands on gravelly lands gave the richer yields of trombiculids of the genus Leptotrombidium, particularly L. pallidum and L. intermedium, than stations in the stabilized Miscanthus grasslands. Banks of paddy fields seemed to be the more suitable habitat for L. pallidum than the Miscanthus grasslands formed on abandoned paddies, where the bed soil is chiefly composed of clayish matter. Seasonally, L. pallidum larvae in the soil first appeared in August, increased in number and reached the peak of abundance in September, then declined but maintained a fairly good population through autumn and winter, and became depopulated by June next year. This seasonal pattern of fluctuation differed remarkably from that observed on wild rodents trapped in the same areas, which showed the clear bimodality in autumn and spring. The trombiculid densities in the soil observed at 2 of the 7 stations were unusually high in 1985,comprising L. intermedium and L. pallidum as the main species; but the densities were significantly decreased in 1986. In these stations, replacement of the dominant species by other one was also observed, giving support to the movability of endemic foci of tsutsugamushi disease.

N2  - Autochemosterilization of mosquitoes by a sound trap necessitated designing an improved formulation of chemosterilant for treatment at inside of the trap. When 18 chemicals including some putative mosquito attractants were screened in mixtures of hempa by contact test, lactic acid mixture gave significantly higher sterility than hempa to Culex pipiens molestus. Metepa was more effective and residual than hempa up to 5 days after treatment both in lactic acid mixture and metepa per se. Topical application of the mixture proved the synergistic activity of lactic acid with metepa. Gas chromatographic analysis of metepa showed that males took up 0.4 times less amount of metepa from the mixture-treated sound trap than the metepa-treated sound trap, because lactic acid was somewhat repellent to males. Nevertheless, the sterility of males was slightly higher with the mixturetreated trap than the metepa-treated trap.

N2  - Electrophoretic studies of isozymes in Simulium ochraceum, the main vector of Central American onchocerciasis, were performed using starch gel electrophoresis. A total of six larval and adult populations originating from four localities in Guatemala (a non-endemic area, Finca La Ruda; a low-endemic area, Finca Rincon; and two high-endemic areas, Finca Brote and Finca Recreo) were analyzed electrophoretically. The enzymes examined were adenylate kinase (AK), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), hexokinase (HK), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), malic enzyme (ME), and phosphoglucomutase (PGM). Of the eight, six enzymes, AK, ALP, HK, IDH, LAP, and ME showed no variation either within or among populations. The other two, GPI and PGM, were found to be highly polymorphic in all six populations. The X^2 test for fit to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) revealed the distribution for the phenotypes of the two polymorphic enzymes not to be significantly out of the HWE. Averages of values of proportion of polymorphic loci (P) and heterozygosity per individual (H) of the six populations were 0.234 and 0.084,respectively, each of which was almost the same value as that for different groups of organisms. Genetic diversity among populations was measured by F_<ST> and G_<ST>, both of which showed that the non-endemic population from Finca La Ruda (D1) was greatly differentiated genetically from the other five populations. The estimates of genetic distance also showed that the D1 population was very distant from the other populations.

N2  - A comprehensive range of organic compounds has been investigated as possible attractants for the seaweed fly, Coelopa (Fucomyia) frigida. The range involved various compounds in different chemical classes and each compound was separately evaluated quantitatively. The compounds which were found to attract significant numbers of the fly were (in the aliphatic halides) chloroform, methyl iodide, methylene chloride and propylene chloride; (in the aliphatic nitros) 2-nitropropane; (in the aromatic hydrocarbons) benzene; and (in the alicyclic hydrocarbons) cyclohexane. In particular we found that chloroform and benzene were the two most effective attractants. In the aliphatic classes, the attractiveness increased with decreasing boiling point of the compounds. In the aromatics, the attractiveness increased with decreasing carbon number. The aliphatic sulfides, nitro compounds, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, aromatic amino compounds, aromatic carboxylic acids, phenols, terpenes, and proteins were all found to be unattractive. The volatile compounds of the decayed laver were isolated and identified by the gas chromatographies, GC-FID, GC-FPD, and GC-MS. The analysis revealed the following constituents (in descending order of quantity); hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, methyl mercaptane, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and traces of either two of the following three compounds; methyl-mercaptomethyldisulfide, mercapto-(2-mercaptoethyl) sulfide, and methylthiomethylmer-captosulfide. There was no relation between the volatile components of the decayed laver and the screened attractive compounds. We therefore consider that the seaweed fly must be attracted through its unknown taxis to certain organic compounds, which are unrelated to the volatile components of the decayed laver.

N2  - Mosquitoes were collected by light traps at several places in Okayama Prefecture since 1950. Principal species collected were Culex pipiens pallens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis. The numbers of collected mosquitoes were integrated during a common sampling period (from 2 June to 1 September). Chronological changes of the annual integration values in each species differed between the sampling sites. The numbers, however, prominently decreased towards 1981 in all of the three species, especially in Cx. tritaenioryhnchus.

N2  - The reproduction and distribution of Tyrophagus putrescentiae were observed in different flooring materials in the laboratory. When pulverized, such flooring materials as straw mat, carpet and insulation board did not seem to be so suitable for reproduction as the flour of the rat food, which is commonly used to culture mites in the laboratory, but the mite maintained their population density at the level of ca. 100 to 2,000/g for a few months, although their density differed by the materials. Assuming the reproduction index of the mite in the pulverized straw is 100,that in straw+rush was 175.4 followed by 106.4 in rush alone, 55.4 in insulation board+rush and 25.3 in insulation board alone. Population density of the mite in the pulverized carpet was as low as 95 to 460/g, but when 10% of the flour of rat food was added, it increased about 10 times. Crawling mites on the surface of the straw mat reached the peak in number 4 to 5 weeks after a small number of mites were initially placed on the mat. More mites were always recovered from the superficial part of the mat than from the inner part, but the number of mites that invaded into the inner part of mat increased as the number of mites placed initially became large. Some mites were found in the inner part of the hard insulation board also, 4 weeks after the initial placement of mites on the surface.

N2  - Compositions of the venomous principles in worker and queen honey bees (Apis mellifera) during their maturation were examined in two criteria by the pattern analysis of electrophoresis and that of high performance liquid chromatography. The venom of well matured worker bee showed electrophoretically 13 proteinous bands including those corresponding to phospholipase A_2,melittin, apamin and MCD-peptide. On the other hand, in the queen bee venom, the band corresponding to MCD-peptide was not detected but the two additional unknown components were found. The amounts of the venomous components in both worker and queen bee venoms increased remarkably within 14 days after eclosion.

The ester, which has the d configuration in the ketoalcohol moiety and the d-trans configuration in the chrysanthemic acid moiety, showed the best performance with 660 times the toxicity over the lowest toxic isomer of l-l-cis configuration from the comparison on LD_<50> values by topical application against houseflies, followed by the d-d-cis configuration. Other isomers were also studied for the order of toxic magnitude.

N2  - The effect of temperature on the oviposition and development of the two Haemaphysalis species, H. longicornis and H. flava was observed under laboratory conditions. The mean number of the deposited eggs per mg body weight of H. longicornis female increased at a high temperature of 30℃, while it decreased at 30℃ in H. flava. The egg hatchability of H. longicornis was high at all temperatures from 15 to 30℃, but that of H. flava was reduced at 30℃. The survival rates during the larval and nymphal post-parasitic period of both species were not significantly different at all temperatures from 15 to 30℃. The pre-oviposition period was short at 30℃ in H. longicornis, but very long in H. flava. The incubation period of eggs became shorter with increasing temperature in H. longicornis, but in H. flava it was longer at 30℃ than at 27℃. The larval and nymphal post-parasitic periods of both species were short at higher temperatures. In H. flava, the larval post-parasitic period was shorter at high temperatures, but the nymphal post-parasitic period was longer at all temperatures, than in H. longicornis. In both species, the developmental zeros for each developmental stage were calculated from the regression equations between developmental velocity and temperature. The total effective temperatures from egg to adult excluding pre-parasitic and parasitic periods in each stage were 820.0 and 961.5 day-degrees for H. longicornis and H. flava, respectively.

N2  - The female reproductive organ of Chrysomya megacephala F. consists of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, a common oviduct, 3 spermatothecae and paired accessory glands. Each ovary is formed of about 100 to 110 polytrophic ovarioles. Externally, each ovariole is enclosed by a thin tunica propria. The common oviduct has syncytial epithelium lined by a thin intima. The duct has both longitudinal and circular muscles. The vagina is distinguishable into anterior and posterior portions. The posterior vagina has longitudinal as well as circular muscles but the anterior vagina has only circular muscle layer. Out of 3 rounded spermatothecae the 2 of one side are loosely bound together. Each spermatotheca is bounded with cuboidal epithelial layer. The cell has a prominent vacuole in the apical half which is filled with secretory material for the benefit of spermatozoa. The paired accessory glands open separately into the genital chamber. These glands show maximum activity during the breeding period.

N2  - An investigation was made to know the seasonal fluctuation of Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich) in Aogashima Island, Tokyo, from December 1982 to December 1984. A trap baited with horse flesh was set at a station on a hill at 300m above sea level, and the numbers of flies trapped were counted once a month. Adult flies were captured from November to June or July, but none was seen for succeeding 3-4 months. It is not clear that females captured in autumn could aestivate in the island or migrated from the nearest Hachijo Island.

Fenthion and fenitrothion were found to be effective among the insecticides tested. The values of LC_<50> were 2.0 and 4.2ppm in fenthion and fenitrothion, respectively. No appreciable difference in the susceptibility to fenthion was recognized between three laboratory colonies of this mite (WMC, SNT and TMI).

N2  - The efficacy of Altosid^[○!R]10F (A 10 F; a slow release formulation containing 10% methoprene) was tested against Culex pipiens pallens larvae and pupae living in four highly polluted ditches in Tokushima. Diluted A 10 F was sprayed on the water surface so that the concentration of methoprene was 0.86-2.27ppm to standing water or 0.34-0.71g/m^2 to the area of water surface. The control effect was evaluated by measuring the corrected emergence inhibition rate (CEIR). The effect of methoprene appeared in pupae and 4th instar larvae collected 0.5hr after spraying and CEIR reached 96-100% in the pupae collected after 24hr. The larvae were immersed in sprayed ditches for 2hr. The adults from those larvae were divided into three groups by the time of their emergence; 0-3,3-13,and 13-24hr. The 3-13hr group was most sensitive to A 10 F. When sprayed into gently flowing ditches, methoprene's relative concentration measured by CEIR of immersed larvae remained higher in the margins than at the center of ditch. The CEIRs at three sprayed ditches remained at 82-100% for one week after the first spray. Following the second spray application carried out one week after the first, the CEIRs remained at 81 and 100% for 9 days at Jonan and Tomitabashi, and 88-100% for 16 days at Okinohama I, and sectors of the ditch downstream from the experimental one also showed reduction in mosquito emergence due to A 10 F. The period showing more than 70% CEIR was 10 days after the second spray application at Jonan-1 (78m downstream), 11 days at Jonan-2 (112m downstream), 10 days at Jonan-3 (153m downstream) and 11 days at Jonan-4 (191m downstream). High CEIRs persisted for 16 days after the second spray application at Okinohama-1 (84m and 37m downstream from the application sites). A similar high level was registered on day 54.

N2  - A northern fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus, captured off the coast of Hanasaki, Hokkaido died in the Marine Aquarium in January, 1980. A total of 283 mature and immature mites were collected from the nasal cavity. Mature mites are elongated in the posterior part of body to form a club-shape with the rounded posterior extremity. Ten to 12 transverse rows of 8 to 12 sharp denticules each and a few rows of minute spines are present on the ventral surface of the capitulum and the posterior surface of coxa III, respectively. From these morphological characteristics the present specimens were identified as Orthohalarachne attenuata (Banks, 1910). Pathological changes in the affected sites by the mites were the marked abrasion of the mucosa and the destruction and necrosis of the deeply placed tissues by the action of the legs, palps and chelicerae of the mites.

N2  - Laboratory and field evaluation of larvicides was carried out against Anopheles sundaicus in a coastal village of North Sumatra, Indonesia in 1984 and 1985. The 4th instar larvae were highly susceptible to methoprene (IC_<50>=0.00009ppm), and susceptible to temephos (LC_<50>=0.0032ppm) and chlorpyrifos-methyl (LC_<50>=0.0037ppm). However, they seemed to be a little tolerant to fenitrothion (LC_<50>=0.015ppm) and fenthion (LC_<50>=0.025ppm). Temephos 5% wp was effective to suppress larval densities almost completely for at least 9 days at a target concentration of 1ppm. Practical efficacy of this chemical was considered to remain for at least 2 weeks, taking the developmental period of the immatures into account. Chlorpyrifos-methyl 5% wp was effective to control larval densities almost completely for 7 days, and fenitrothion 50% EC was effective for less than 5 days after 1ppm field application. Field application of methoprene 10% flowable formulation (Altosid 10F) attained more than 90% emergence inhibition against the immatures for 2 weeks in artificial ditch type ponds at 1ppm target concentration, and 100% inhibition for 4 weeks in a natural flood field at 0.062g a.j./m^2 dose.

N2  - A case of hematoma of scalp in a 9-year-old female baby caused by Lucilia sericata (Meigen) was recorded in August 1985. This case is the first verified record of myiasis produced by L. sericata from Pakistan. The salient morphological features of third instar larvae can easily be distinguished from those of other bottle flies.

N2  - Egg-batches of Hybomitra montana (Meigen, 1820) were collected from marsh plants at Ajiro Heights of Iwate Prefecture from middle to late August of 1982 and 1983. The batches were found on the underside of leaves of 3 plants, mostly Gentiana triflora, at the average height of 12cm above the ground or the water surface. Those were greyish brown to dark brown in color, and roughly semi-oval in shape with 3 to 4 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 206. Only one egg-batch was parasitized by wasps. An ant, Formica sp., was observed preying upon eggs.

N2  - Experimental infections of Simulium takahasii (Rubtsov) with Dirofilaria immitis were carried out by feeding newly-emerged female flies on an infected dog with a microfilaremia of 1,808mf/20 (mm)^3 of blood. The intakes of microfilariae by 20 flies fluctuated from 21 to 313 (mean 103.4). Out of 150 flies which were blood fed and maintained at 26℃, 137 were dissected at 24-hr intervals during the period of 1-16 days post feeding. As a result, during the first 2 days 27 of 28 flies examined harboured large numbers of microfilariae mostly in the stomach. After 3 days, 71 (65%) of 109 flies dissected contained 1-16 developing larvae (mean 3.8) mostly in the Malpighian tubules. Among 261 developing larvae recovered, 83 (32%) and 17 (6.5%) developed to the second- and third-stage larvae, respectively. The earliest moultings from the first to the second and from the second to the third stage took place on day 8 and 12,respectively. All the third-stage larvae recovered were alive and appeared morphologically normal, with the body lengths of 658.3-979.5μm. It has been proved that S. takahasii is susceptible to infection with D. immitis, and the latter's development occurs also in the Malpighian tubules, as in mosquito vectors.

N2  - The seasonal occurrence of three ixodid ticks, Haemaphysalis flava, Ixodes ovatus and I. nipponensis on wild animals and vegetations was investigated in the south-western part of Saitama Prefecture. Investigation on wild animals was made from 1976 through 1984,and on vegetations by flagging method from 1981 through 1983. 1. H. flava adults were collected on vegetations throughout the year, but the number decreased markedly in summer and slightly in winter. The nymphs showed similar trend to the adults with a large population throughout the year. The seasonal occurrence of the larvae showed an unimodality with a large peak in July to November. 2. The occurrence of I. ovatus adults on vegetations was common from spring to summer, whose pattern was characterized by the absence of autumn peak. The nymphs were seen on wild mice and moles from spring to autumn with a peak in April, and the larvae from autumn to spring with a peak in November. 3. I. nipponensis adults on vegetations were relatively abundant in June and July. Because of a small number of adults collected, its seasonal occurrence was indistinct. The nymphs on vegetations were abundant in March to August, but scarce in September to February. The parasitic activity pattern of the nymphs on lizards was similar to that on vegetations. The larvae on vegetations showed an unimodality with a large peak in July to October, but those on lizards were active from April to early December. 4. An outline of seasonal occurrence patterns of three ixodid ticks was pictured. The characteristics of seasonal occurrence of each ixodid tick were discussed in relation to environmental temperatures and diapause.

N2  - The distribution of ixodid ticks was surveyed by flagging method from 1981 through 1983 within a low mountain zone of south-western part of Saitama Prefecture, and Haemaphysalis flava, Ixodes ovatus, I. nipponensis, I. tanuki and I. turdus were collected from eight survey areas. The forest types of these areas were roughly classified into three groups : the plantation of Sugi cedar and Hinoki cypress, the secondary forest composed of mainly Konara oak, and the patchily mixed forest of the above. H. flava was most widely distributed in the secondary forest and the plantation, and I. ovatus was abundant in the plantation, while I. nipponensis in the secondary and the mixed forest. The relationship between vegetative types and tick distribution was discussed. The hight preference of a host lizard, Takydromus tachydromoides for the secondary forest was suggested to be a factor affecting the distribution of I. nipponensis. Unstable humidity and temperature in a day at the ground stratum of the secondary forest were suggested to be a factor causing the low population of I. ovatus. For I. tanuki and I. turdus, no special feature of distribution was observed because of few individuals collected.

N2  - Surveys of tsutsugamushi disease rickettsia and the vector trombiculid mites were done by trapping wild rodents and other small animals at the southwestern part of Gifu Prefecture during 1980 to 1984. Eight out of 59 field mice, Apodemus speciosus, were found positive for Rickettsia tsutsugamushi infection. Some of the isolated strains of R. tsutsugamushi were examined by complement fixation and partly by immunofluorescent tests; these belonged to Gilliam or Karp types. Two species of probable vectors, Leptotrombidium pallidum and L. scutellare, were found among the 12 species of trombiculid mites collected from the wild rodents. These results indicate that the surveyed area has been potentially endemic with tsutsugamushi disease since the last investigation carried out in 1950's.

N2  - In order to study the effects of insecticides on the behaviour of female mosquitoes under the laboratory conditions, a series of cage tests were carried out. The apparatus was composed of two wire-cages (30×30×30cm each); one served as a release cage of avid mosquitoes and the other served as a mouse-baited cage. The wide-mesh net was impregnated with the candidate insecticide at different doses and interposed between the two cages, but the mosquitoes were able to pass through the mesh. The mosquitoes were introduced at 3pm and recovered 19hrs later. The result showed that phenothrin treated net had marked effects on the behaviour of Anopheles stephensi. There was a high level of inhibition in entering the bait-cage and in feeding blood. Also fed mosquitoes were driven out of the bait-cage by the irritant action of the insecticide. However, a high mortality masked those responses at a dose higher than 0.64g/m^2. It was also demonstrated that the avid mosquitoes, which were introduced into the bait-cage, moved away to the other cage without feeding. In the case of Culex pipiens pallens, deterrent effects in the entering behaviour were almost negligible. Feeding in Aedes albopictus was less inhibited than in the other mosquitoes. Reduction of entry and feeding by the fenitrothion treated net was due to high mortality of mosquitoes. The inhibition of feeding was observed in Cx. pipiens pallens which shows high resistance to this insecticide, though they entered the bait-cage. This apparatus seems to be practical for assessing the behavioural reaction to insecticides of various species of mosquitoes.

N2  - The fecundity (the number of oocytes matured per fly in the first gonotrophic cycle) of an anautogenous blackfly, Simulium takahasii was quantitatively studied in relation to blood-meal sizes ingested. A full human blood meal usually weighing more than body weight resulted in varied fecundities (212 to 409), although the proportion of oocytes matured per fly was high in all flies (85.9-100%). Regression analysis indicated that larger individuals took more blood meal and produced more eggs. Interrupted blood-feeding trials showed that initiation of oocyte development beyond the quiescent stage rarely occurred in flies fed with less than 0.5mg of blood or less than 1/4 the body weight, but this proportion rapidly increased and reached up to 100%, as the ingested blood-meal size increased to 1.0mg or 1/2 the body weight. On the other hand, the proportion of oocytes matured per fly, hence fecundity too, tended to increase gradually throughout the range of blood-meal sizes (up to 2.0mg, nearly equivalent to body size).

Mayacnephia aguirrei colonized first, then Simulium metallicum, S. horacioi and S. ochraceum appeared, followed by S. callidum and S. (Hemicnetha) spp. The colonizing order of these species coincided with the order of a preference for stream discharge from small to large. Mayacnephia aguirrei had at least three generations in a year.

N2  - Tabanid flies in blood-sucking activity were captured by CO_2-lured mosquito-net traps which were set at 6 sampling sites along the basin of the Horobetsu River at the horse-breeding center of Hidaka District in Hokkaido for 2 days in the early August of 1976. In total 2,726 female flies of 16 species were captured in the area with a marked predominancy of Tabanus nipponicus and T. chrysurus. Number of species and flies were more numerous in the upstream to midstream than in the downstream, though number of flies greatly fluctuated among the sites. T. chrysurus and Haematopota tristis were most abundant in the upstream where forestlands spread, but T. nipponicus and T. trigonus were predominantly abundant in the midstream to downstream where pasturelands developed. The abundance of flies was not directly related to the richness of blood-sources in this region, but rather depended on the existence of larval habitats in each sampling site.

N2  - The fauna and distribution of the blackflies in Gunma Prefecture were investigated by collecting the early stages of flies from streams at 66 sites in July and August of 1984. A total of 4,684 larvae and 550 pupae belonging to 2 genera and 19 species, including three unknown species, were collected at 57 sites. Eleven species, Simulium (Eusimulium) konoi, S. (E.) mie, S. (E.) subcostatum, S. (E.) uchidai, S. (Boophthora) yonagoense, S. (Gomphostilbia) omutaense, S. (G.) shogakii, S. (Gnus) bidentatum, S. (Simulium) kawamurae, S. (S.) nikkoense, and S. (S.) rufibasis were newly recorded from Gunma Prefecture. Predominant species was S. (S.) japonicum (43.6%) followed by S. (E.) uchidai (17.7%), S. (O.) iwatense (11.3%), and S. (E.) subcostatum (7.9%). Species most widely distributed from the lowland to the highland were S. (S.) japonicum, S. (E.) subcostatum, S. (E.) uchidai, and S. (E.) mie.

N2  - The larval development of the north Venezuelan Onchocerca volvulus in the 3 Guatemalan simuliid species, i.e. Simulium callidum, S. ochraceum and S. haematopotum was experimentally studied, as compared with that in S. metallicum, the natural vector in the northern Venezuela. All these 3 species ingested as many microfilariae as did the Venezuelan S. metallicum, while feeding on the infected volunteer. However, most microfilarine ingested by S. ochraceum and S. haematopotum were found damaged probably due to the buccopharyngeal armature. The subsequent migration of the microfilariae occurred in 20% S. callidum but very rarely in the other 2 species, while it took place in 76% S. metallicum. At 22℃, third-stage larvae were found in 8% S. callidum and 3% S. haematopotum, but not in all the 51 S. ochraceum examined 9-14 days postfeeding. In contrast, they were found in 16 or 29% of S. metallicum from Venezuela. Overall, it was indicated that beside S. metallicum, the 2 other Guatemalan blackfly species, S. callidum and S. haematopotum, can, despite the low rates, support larval development of the north Venezuelan O. volvulus to the third stage. Our data do not seem to support the assumption that there is mutual incompatibility of O. volvulus to tee vectors between Guatemala and ncrth Venezuela.

N2  - In order to clarify the component species of ixodid ticks in the low mountain zone, surveys of ixodid ticks on wild animals were made from 1976 throught1984,and on vegetations by flagging method from 1981 through 1983,in the southwestern area of Saitama Prefecture. 1. On vegetations, 25,086 ticks of five species belonging to two genera were collected. Haemaphysalis flava (all stages) was the predominant species, which constituted 96.8% of the total flagging collection, and was followed by Ixodes ovatus (adults), I. nipponensis (larvae, nymphs, adults), I. turdus (larvae, nymphs), and I. tanuki (adults). 2. From medium-sized mammals, 5,065 ticks of seven species belonging to two genera were collected. H. flava (larvae, nymphs, adults) occupied 98.8% of the total parasitic ticks, and was followed by I. tanuki (adults), I. nipponensis (adults), I. persulcatus (adults), I. ovatus (larvae, adults), larval Ixodes sp. LC, and nymphal Ixodes sp. NS. 3. From wild mice and moles, 104 immature Ixodes ticks of four species were collected. I. ovatus constituted 63.5%, and I. nipponensis, I. persulcatus, and larval Ixodes sp. LY followed it. Any stages of H. flava were not collected from small mammals. 4. One thousand, three hundred and nineteen Kanahebi lizards, Takydromus tachydromides, were also surveyed from 1982 through 1984,and 1934 larvae and 730 nymphs of I. nipponensis were collected. Average percentage of parasitized lizards was 67.5%, which was much higher than that of small mammals of the survey area.

N2  - During the spring of 1967-1975,overwintered mosquitoes were collected by using dry ice-traps at terraced rice field areas of 14 localities in Osaka Prefecture. More Culex tritaeniorhynchus were collected from izumi-Mibayasi area than from any other areas. The collection site at Izumi-Mibayasi area was on the terrace in the middle of the River Makio, and characterized by clusters of the eulalia Miscanthus sinensis along the banks between terraced rice fields. Eighty-four emergence-traps were placed over the side of grassy banks or stone walls between rice fields in the early spring of 1968-1970. None of the traps yielded any Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. One trap yielded a single female of Cx. pipiens pallens each at Simamoto area and Higasiosaka-Kamisizyo area. At Izumi-Mibayasi area one trap yielded two females of Cx. pipiens pallens plus five females of Anopheles sinensis, and another yielded two females of An. sinensis. A total of 99 pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (5,075 females) were inoculated into suckling mice. No virus was isolated.

N2  - Overwintered females of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which is the most important vector of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, were collected by using dry ice-traps from March to June at Izumi-Mibayasi area in Osaka Prefecture, 1967-1975. Ovarian dissections revealed that almost all of the females just having emerged from hibernation were nulliparous. From the beginning of September to the first week of October the numbers of host-seeking females of tritaeniorhynchus collected with the CO_2 baited light trap continued to decrease to zero. However, autumnal build-up of its larval population was observed. These results indicated that in the fall few newly-emerged females were developing an appetite for blood. From these results above mentioned, it is not likely that JE virus overwinters in the bodies of tritaeniorhynchus females.

N2  - From April to June Culex tritaeniorhynchus females were collected by dry ice-traps at overwintering site in Izumi-Mibayasi area and also by using sucking tube and net at cow-shed in Izumi-Kurotori area, Osaka Prefecture, 1967-1972. The collection site in Izumi-Mibayasi area was located on terraced rice field area along River Makio, where there were no animal sheds in the immediate vicinity. The cow-shed in Izumi-Kurotori area was situated on a plain area having developed rice-fields, which are the main larval breeding place of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus about 5.5km down the River Makio from Izumi-Mibayasi area. Ovarian dissections revealed that all of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus females collected early in season in the cow-shed were nulliparous. The date for the earliest catch of overwintered Cx. tritaeniorhynchus females was later in Izumi-Kurotori area than in Izumi-Mibayasi area in every year. It may be concluded that a plain area was not the substantial overwintering place of this mosquito. There was a correlation between the number of overwintered females and that of newly-emerged females in Izumi-Kurotori area. But in Izumi-Mibayasi area, the number of overwintered females did not much influence the population density in a new generation. We would say that blood source in a large area of larval breeding place takes the most important part in the population growth of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus.

N2  - The present paper deals with the results of the resistance tests on two species of mosquitoes, Anopheles sinensis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus, collected from the suburb of Omiya City, Saitama Prefecture in 1984. The larvae of both species showed high resistance to malathion and fenitrothion with the LC_<50> values of 13-20ppm. Increased resistance to temephos and fenthion was discovered in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, the LC_<50> values being 52.0ppm for temephos and 31.6ppm for fenthion, but only low resistance was indicated in An. sinensis, the LC_<50> values being 0.112ppm for temephos and 0.178ppm for fenthion. As regards carbamates higher LC_<50> values were observed in An. sinensis than in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Against permethrin An. sinensis was less susceptible than Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. The adults of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were highly resistant to fenthion, the LD_<50> being 17.0μg, as compared with 0.037μg for An. sinensis. Between the two colonies of An. sinensis tested, Saitama colony was slightly more resistant to the insecticides than Nagasaki colony established in 1972. To pursue the relationship between OP resistance and esterase activity, the agar gel thin layer electrophoresis method was carried out by using the adults of An. sinensis and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. The esterase bands that hydrolyze β-naphthylacetate showed higher activities in the resistant colonies compared with the susceptible strains. Saitama colony of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus showed markedly high esterase activity.

N2  - Regardless of the presence or absence of nest holes or other living signs of field rodents, soil samples (each with a volume of ca. 2,000(cm)^3) were dug out with a quadrate steel frame (20cm×20cm×5cm) at the selected sites in Nagano Prefecture. These samples were placed in the modified Tullgren's funnels for separating chigger mites. Chiggers obtained from the soil differed to some extent in the species composition from those found on the field mouse, Apodemus speciosus, livetrapped concurrently in the respective survey sites. At Matsumoto City, for example, Leptotrombidium intermedium was predominant among the chigger species in the soil, followed by L. pallidum, L. palpale, and Gahrliepia saduski; whereas, L. fuji was noticeably numerous among the chiggers found on A. speciosus. Species composition in the soil samples, however, varied according to the areas surveyed. Numbers of chiggers in the soil samples were usually less than those found on the wild rodents; but this alone could not be a serious drawback of the soil sampling. Rather, soil samples seem to give the better epidemiological information, because the samples taken from the sites haunted by the residents such as foot-paths between cultivated fields or grasslands around the dwelling quarters in Miasa Village and Iida City, where we could hardly trap the wild rodents, yielded a number of L. pallidum larvae, the most probable vector in this prefecture, besides several other chigger species. Such infiltrating distribution of L. Pallidum into the residential areas as evidenced in this report may give a positive explanation for the risk of contracting tsutsugamushi disease in such areas.

N2  - A focus counting method using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique was adopted to demonstrate the multiplication of chikungunya virus in individual Aedes albopictus mosquito of large numbers. The number of foci was counted 20hr after the inoculation of test samples into BHK-21 cells and the amount of virus was expressed semiquantitatively as -, +, 2+, 3+ and 4+. The grade of foci was proportional to the results of plaque assay. Most of test specimens with confluent foci (4+) showed (10)^6-(10)^7 PFU/mosquito. Marked differences were observed in the amount of virus in mosquitoes among different strains. percentages of individuals showing 4+ grade foci were 30.0% in Oahu strain and 5.0% in Osaka strain. no high-grade individual was observed in the strains from okinawa, Sendai, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. Rearing conditions for adult mosquitoes tended to affect the occurrence of the high-grade individuals.

N2  - Tabanid flies were collected by CO_2-lured mosquito-net traps, which were set at four different altitudes (690,720,760 and 800m) and at two sites with different vegetation (grass and wooded lands) in a pasture in Kitakami Heights of Iwate prefecture, in the summer of 1983. Tabanus chrysurus and T. trigeminus, aquatic in larval habitat, were most abundant at lower altitudes. Hirosia humilis and T. rufidens, terrestrial in wooded lands, were most abundant at middle altitude (760m). T. nipponicus and T. fulvimedioides, terrestrial in open lands, were rather abundant at middle and lowest altitudes in the former, and most abundant at the highest altitude in the latter. Number of species, however, was not greatly varied with the altitude. In this study area marshes are present only at lower altitudes, and grassland develops at higher altitudes. Therefore, the blood-sucking sites for tabanid flies were paralleled to their own larval habitats. As for vegetation, the flies were relatively abundant under similar environments to their larval habitats except for Hi. humilis, which was more abundant in grasslands than in wooded lands.

N2  - To detect the flower-visiting of tabanid flies, the presence of pollen was examined microscopically in the females of 70 species belonging to 10 genera and in the males of 14 species belonging to 6 genera. The rate of species with pollen was 92.9% both in females and males, and the rate of flies with pollen was 20-30% in most species. The species which showed more than 50% of the rate were Stonemyia yezoensis, Silvius shirakii, Si. oshimaensis, Chrysops japonicus, C. nigripes, Hybomitra harai, Atylotus sawadai, A. angusticornis, Tabanus chrysurinus, T. fulvilineus, T. ryukyuensis, Isshikia japonica and I. yajimai in females, and T. taiwanus in males. No conspicuous differences existed in the rate of flies with pollen between females and males and between unautogenous and autogenous species.

N2  - The predatory capacities and efficiencies of Sympetrum frequens dragonfly nymphs on Anopheles sinensis mosquito larvae were evaluated in the laboratory as part of a series of studies on their prey-predator relationship in rice fields. The 8th, 9th and 10th instar nymphs of S. frequens consumed 12,19 and 28 individuals of the 4th instar larvae or more than 100 individuals of the 2nd instar larvae of An. sinensis per day, respectively, when the prey larvae were plentiful. During the 30-day period between the 8th and 10th nymphal instars (except for 3 or 4 days just before emergence), the nymph of S. frequens consumed an average of 524 individuals of 4th instar larvae of An. sinensis. The manner of functional response of the 8-10th instar nymph of S. frequens differed according to the instar stage of the An. sinensis larvae. The consumption rate per day for the 4th instar larvae of An. sinensis was the highest at nearly 1.0 when one individual of the prey was given in a container with a diameter of 10cm. The rate decreased with increased prey density in the container. When the 2nd instar larvae of An. sinensis were given, high consumption rates of about 0.85 were shown at densities of eight and or higher in the container. At densities of four or lower, however, the rate decreased rapidly. The 10th instar nymph of S. frequens wandered at all hours of the day, and the distance moved was about 5m per day. However, the nymph of S. frequens consumed a greater number of An. sinensis larvae at night time by comparison with that in the daytime.

N2  - The effects of various temperatures on the life cycle of Carpoglyphus lactis were investigated. The container and the food for mites were the same as those reported in the previous paper. The temperatures used were 5,10,15,20,25,30 and 35℃. The relative humidity varied, depending upon temperatures, from 90.5% R. H. to 100% R. H. One egg was observed until it gave rise to an adult mite. After pairing the grown female and male, the fecundity was observed. The observation was continued till the individual mite died in the container. At 5 and 35℃ it was impossible for the mite to grow. At lower temperatures, within the range between 10 and 30℃, completion of the life cycle and the longevity were prolonged, and the number of mites giving rise to adults decreased. Total numbers of eggs laid per female at 15 and 20℃ were larger than those at the other temperatures. At 30℃ the period for the development from an egg to an adult, 6.8 days, was shortest and the appearance rate of the adults was highest. These two effects of the high temperature seem to make amends for the lower fecundity and the shorter longevity, resulting in the fast increase of the mite population.

N2  - Bacteria and fungi associated with the house-dust mite Dermatophagoides were investigated. The house-dust mites were washed with sterile distilled water and homogenized. Bacterial count, isolation and identification of the bacteria and fungi were made with routine laboratory methods for medical pathogens. The number of bacteria counted per 100 mites in positive samples was 12.7 for laboratory-bred Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae, more than 121 for mites from control houses, and more than 66 and 121 for those from houses with asthmatic and Kawasaki disease patients, respectively. The bacteria isolated from the house-dust mites were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Gramnegative non-fermenting rods and Gram-positive coryneform rods. As for fungi, Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp., Alternaria spp., Acremonium spp., Paecilomyces spp. and yeasts were isolated. All of those microorganisms found were indigenous microbes and there was no particular difference in their occurrence between the house-dust mites from control houses and those from houses with asthmatic or Kawasaki disease patients. The public health importance of the house-dust mites as a possible vector of the microorganisms was discussed.

N2  - The digestive tract of Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus was composed of pharynx, esophagus, anterior midgut, posterior midgut and hindgut. Among them the midgut had microvilli on the luminal surface of the epithelial cell. The food materials were wrapped up in a peritrophic membrane and forced to the hindgut. Microorganism was not found in the digestive tract of the mite maintained in our laboratory. Oil gland was a paired gland having the orifice at each side of posterior abdomen. This cell consisted of a single cell and contained fluid material in the lumen. Body cuticle was composed of 3 layers : epicuticle, exocuticle, and endocuticle. The endocuticle was the thickest, and was characterized by closely spaced lamellae structures. Many pore canals from epithelial cell ran through endocuticle to epicuticle. D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus described here did not have symbionts such as microorganism.

N2  - The effects of day length and temperature during the larval stage of Anopheles koreicus on the phenotype of adult were experimentally studied. The short photoperiod (9hr/day) during the larval stage caused the predominance (about 80% or more) of edwardsi-type among the females which emerged in all temperature groups tested (ranging from 15 to 25℃). On the other hand, the long photoperiod (15hr/day) caused high prevalence (43.9 to 100%) of korei-cus-type in the females, although edwardsi-type females also emerged in a considerable extent (41.5%) in the high temperature (25℃) group. In the males reared under the long photoperiod, koreicus-type was predominant (80 to 100%) in all temperature groups, while under the short photoperiod edwadsi-type males increased moderately (16.7 to 60.0%). From these results, it is concluded that the photoperiod during the larval stage is a main factor determining the seasonal forms of adult Anoheles koreicus, but the temperature is only a supplemental factor.

N2  - Biting midges were collected by light traps at a cowshed on the flat plateau in Nishinasuno and at a montane pasture in Shiobara, Tochigi Prefecture, during a grazing season, April to October. 17 species of Culicoides were confirmed to occur at the areas surveyed, of which 9 species occurred at the former area and 13 at the latter. Among these species, the 4 species, C. sinanoensis, C. maculatus, C. sanguisuga and C. matsuzawai, were predominant. The faunal composition consists of more northern elements than that of the central part of Kanto District. High engorged rates of C. matsuzawai and C. ohmorii suggest a preference for cattle in blood sucking, in addition to Culicoides species that had been reported to prefer it.

S-21149 was more effective against 4th (last)-instar larvae than 3rd-instar ones. It inhibited 100% adult emergence of C. pipiens pallens after only 1 min immersion at 0.1ppm. S-21149 and S-21150 also exhibited good persistence in an open outside condition.

N2  - The experimental evaluation of some anti-larval agents against Anopheles sundaicus, the main vector of the coastal malaria in North Sumatra was carried out in the field and laboratory. Susceptibility test in the laboratory indicated the high sensitivity of the 4th instar larvae of An. sundaicus to temephos (LC_<50>=0.0034ppm), Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis preparation (B.t.i.) (LC_<50>=0.1176ppm) and methoprene (EC_<50>=0.0004ppm). In the small-scale field test, the efficiency was clear when the wettable powder of temephos was applied at a concentration of 1ppm of the practical dosage. No larvae were found in the ponds for 1 week after the treatment. The practical efficacy was considered to continue for 2 weeks in the pond water. The efficacies of 0.5ppm dosage of powdered temephos or other larvicides were not always evident in the field. The native larvivorous fishes were examined for their predatory activity in the laboratory. Each one of Oryzias javanicus, Haplochilus panchax and Poecilia reticulata fed 18-22 individuals of 4th instar larvae per day. The integration of the fish and the larvicide for the larval control can be considered possible since each larvicide tested was less toxic to the fishes.

N2  - We observed a pupation rate, an emerging rate, number of eggs laid and a hatching rate of Aedes togoi after exposure to two kinds of chemosterilants. An incidence of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa in the seminal vesicles was also examined by electron microscopy. The sterilization rate and the incidence of abnormal spermatozoa were 48.2 and 10.3%, respectively, at 0.01% metepa; 79.1,44.5,and 7.9,5.9%, respectively, at the concentrations of 0.05 and 0.01% hempa. However, the rates of occurrence of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa were lower than the sterilization rates. Although it seemed that there was little correlation between the sterilization rates and malformation rates of spermatozoa, the incidence of spermatozoa with multi-axial filaments increased with the sterilization rates.

Until 24hr after infection G-cell of almost all of the larvae found in the thorax completed first cell division, however many of the larvae showed an abnormal appearance of cuticle. Until 48hr after infection almost all the larvae showed unusual features of cuticle and in some specimens prolapse of the cells were observed. On the 5th day after infection pigmentation around cuticle was observed on many larvae. Pigmentation which is blackish-brown in color remained unchanged in the thorax until the 10th day. The cellular response by the host mosquitoes, which was seen on the encapsulated larvae in the abdominal haemocoel, was not observed in the thoracic muscles.

N2  - In order to clarify their ability to over winter, the eggs, full grown larvae and 1-day-old pupae of Musca domestica, Phormia regina and Aldrichina grahami, were exposed to low temperatures from 8 down to 4℃. 1. The mortality of immature stages of flies was increased by lowering the temperature of exposure and by increasing the duration of the exposure period. 2. In general, the larva was the most tolerant stage to cold temperatures. Eggs, in comparison to larvae and pupae, were less tolerant. Exposure days required for 50% mortality in immature M. domestica exposed to 4℃ were 1.6-3.7,2.5-3.3 and 2.7-3.8 days for eggs, larvae and pupae, respectively. Those of P. regina were 2.1-2.6,10-13 and 3.6-5.5 days respectively, and those of A. grahami were 4.1,13 and 6.2 days. 3. A. grahami was the most tolerant to cold temperatures among three species of flies, followed by P. regina and M. domestica. 4. The tolerance to cold temperatures of M. domestica and P. regina which were collected from different districts were compared. The strains used in the experiment are as follows : M. domestica from Takatsuki, Nara, Tongduchon (Korea) and Bangkok (Thailand), and P. regina from Akita, Tokyo and Samegai. In the four M. domestica strains, the mortality of larvae exposed to cold temperatures was found to be significantly lower in the Bangkok strain than in other strains. In the three P. regina strains, the mortality of pupae was found to be significantly higher in the Akita strain than in the Tokyo and Samegai strains. 5. It is suggested that only an extremely small number of immature stages of flies overwinter in temperate climatic regions.

N2  - The spatial and temporal distributions of Culex tritaeniorhynchus were studied with sound traps at an unisolated 1.7 ha area of a paddy field in Chikugo City from Jul. 23 to Aug. 4. Fourteen traps were placed on black cloth swarm markers at 20-50m distance from each other, and a 370Hz, 100 or 110dB sound was emitted for 20min during the swarming time, 19 : 42 to 20 : 02. As the results, 20,141 males and 1,116 females in total were caught. There was a sex-biased spatial distribution; males evenly distributed over the breeding paddy, but some males nightly migrated out to a pigpen nearby. The females, on the contrary, took the host appetent flight and heavily concentrated in the vicinity to the pigpen. The significant reduction of blood-fed females trapped and resting in vegetation was observed towards the end of experiment. This reduction would be attributed to the decreased emergence of mosquitoes due to the mid-season water drainage in the paddy or the increased rates of virgin females due to the possible mating disruption by sound, or both.

N2  - A mature larva of a psychodid fly was detected in fresh urine of a woman at the age of 69 who has been suffering from cystitis. The specimen was 9mm long. The colour was grayish white in the body and dark brown in the head, dorsal plates and siphon. There were 3 dorsal plates on each of the abdominal terga second to seven. The specimen was identified as Telmatoscopus albipunctatus Williston from its morphological characteristics. This case is considered to be the first report on human urinary myiasis due to this species.

N2  - Five mature larvae of a flesh fly were recorded from the nasal cavity of a 28-year-old man with terminal seminoma. These larvae, approximately 15-16mm long, had been reared at room temperature. Subsequently, 3 male and 2 female flies emerged. The specimens were identified as Boettcherisca peregrina Robineau-Desvoidy from morphological characteristics. This is the first report on human nasal myiasis due to this species.

N2  - Isozyme variations of Guatemalan blackflies, Simulium ochraceum, S. metallicum, S. horacioi, were studied using starch gel electrophoresis. Three out of seven enzymes examined, alkaline phosphatase, α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and leucine aminopeptidase were found to show developmental changes in their respective electrophoretic patterns, suggesting some regulatory mechanism in the gene activity. Two enzymes, glucosephosphate isomerase and phosphoglucomutase, showed high polymorphism in every species studied, and the remaining enzymes, monomorphism. We found marked differences in electrophoretic patterns among the three species. Two methods, that is, Nei's genetic distance (D) and allelic distance (A_D), were used to calculate genetic distances among them. Both estimations of genetic distances showed that S. ochraceum is remote from the other two species, though the distance estimate between S. ochraceum and S. horacioi is rather small. Surprisingly, S. horacioi, which is considered to be very close to S. metallicum, showed a rather large distance from this allied species, indicating that they are not so close.

N2  - A field experiment was carried out in Guatemala on movement response of the larvae of Simulium ochraceum and S. horacioi to various depth and velocity conditions in a trough (250×10×7cm). According to increase in stream depth (from 0.25 to 4cm) and decrease in current velocity (from 160 to 2.5cm/sec), the most common movement by larvae of both species changed in the sequence of (1) upstream looping, (2) descent on a silk thread, and (3) downstream free drift without a silk thread. The ratio of larvae staying in the original section of the trough during the 30-min exposure to stream water was highest (93% for S. ochraceum and 95% for S. horacioi) when current velocity was 40cm/sec. According to the decrease in velocity, the ratio of staying larvae decreased, and that of descending ones increased. The maximum ratio of descending larvae was recorded at the smallest velocity (2.5cm/sec) and greatest depth (4cm). At the maximum velocity (160cm/sec), 16% of the total S. ochraceum and 41% of the total S. horacioi were washed downstream. S. horacioi was more active in upstream looping at small velocity, and less tolerant to large velocity than S. ochraceum.

A total of 32,823 males and 41,691 females were collected and identified by two light traps operated at about weekly intervals from 25 April to 24 October, 1984. They were classified into 30 species of subfamily Chironominae, 4 species of subfamily Orthocladiinae, and 7 species of subfamily Tanypodinae, and were judged as including one new species and other 5 species new to Japan. Morphological or taxonomical notes were presented with 19 species among them together with figures referring to 16 species.

N2  - Seven hundred and twenty seven individuals of the black flies (Simuliidae) belonging to 6 genera and 11 species were collected in 1984 at the Onnebetsu-dake wilderness area in Shiretoko National Park of Hokkaido. The predominant species were Stegopterna nukabirana, Simulium japonicum, Distosimulium daisetsense and Twinnia canivora. Three hundred and sixteen out of 727 individuals (43.5%) were observed to have blood-meals, and the sources of their blood-meals were determined serologically using ELISA. The blood-meals of D. daisetsense reacted with anti-human serum (6 individuals), anti-sika deer serum (8 indiv.) and anti-birds serum (3 indiv.); those of T. canivora with anti-human serum (4 indiv.) and anti-sika deer serum (3 indiv.); those of S. japonicum with anti-human serum (1 indiv.) and anti-sika deer serum (2 indiv.); those of S. nukabirana with anti-human serum (15 indiv.) and anti-wild brown bear serum (19 indiv.); and those of S. rufibasis with anti-human serum (2 indiv.) and anti-Bedford's red-backed vole serum (1 indiv.).

N2  - Culture methods of 3 species of chironomids widely distributed in urban areas in Japan were studied to obtain purified antigens necessary for the accurate diagnoses and desensitization therapies of hypersensitivity to chironomids. It was demonstrated that all the 3 species can be easily cultured from generation to generation in the laboratory. High yields per unit area of mature larvae of Chironomus yoshimatsui and C. flaviplumus were obtained by rearing the newly hatched larvae at densities of 8 and 4 indiv./(cm)^2,respectively, under food dose of 7.5mg/indiv. in the small containers (15cmφ×H9cm) which were spread with sand, filled with water and aerated. Fertilized egg masses of Glyptotendipes tokunagai were successfully obtained even at low adult densities in small containers when the sex ratio (♂/♀) was higher than 2/5. A considerable number of fertilized egg masses of C. flaviplumus were obtained even in a relatively small space when a time period corresponding to dusk was introduced into the illumination cycle and the illumination was reduced to 1 or 2lx in a stepwise manner at "dusk" under the sex ratio (♂/♀) of 2.

N2  - Histological observations of Brugia malayi infected mosquitoes, Armigeres subalbatus, prepared at 0.5,3,12,24,48hrs and on 3,5,7,10 days after blood meal, were carried out by routine paraffin sectioning and hematoxylineosin staining method. Light brown substances around microfilari-form larvae were observed as early as 30min post-infection and some parts of them had begun to change in color from light brown to dark brown. Until 90min post-infection almost all of the larvae in the abdominal haemocoel were enclosed in a dark brown capsule. Thereafter, many round shaped cells were observed attached on the pigmented capsule until about 3hrs post-infection. The adhered cells became distinctly flattened by 24hrs post-infection and the nucleus of the individual cell became difficult to be recognized. After 48hrs post-infection, cell layer around the pigmented capsule was recognized as a faintly basophilic or brownish layer. Inside the cell layer many minute brown particles were observed from 5 to 10 day post-infection. It was clarified that cellular response by host mosquitoes lagged behind the pigmentation and that the cells of mosquitoes played a role in a series of encapsulation reactions against filarial larvae in the abdominal haemocoel.

N2  - In female cockroaches, Periplaneta americana and P. australasiae, ultraviolet rays inhibit the oothecal formation. Morphological manipulation of the head of cockroaches showed that the site of ultraviolet reception was located in the region of antacoria. Light-evoked spike discharges were recorded from that region and the maximal response was obtained at the wavelength of 254nm. These results of structual and functional investigations showed that the site of ultraviolet reception was located at the nerve-cord-like structure under the antacoria.

N2  - Adopting the individual rearing method, the effect of relative humidities of 86,76,61 and 36% RH on the life cycle of Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus was observed under a constant temperature at 25℃. At 76% RH, the eggs of D. farinae developed to adult in the shortest duration of 39.6±6.6 (29-60) days; 8.1±0.1 days for egg, 8.2±0.3 days for larva, 17.0±5.7 days for protonymph and 6.6±0.4 days for tritonymph. In D. farinae, under each humidity, two types of the protonymphal stage were observed. One had a shorter stage of 5-10 days and another had that longer than 15 days. The former was named as the regular protonymph and the latter as the prolonged protonymph. At 61% RH, a few prolonged tritonymphs, which required more than 20 days before molting to the adults, were also observed. The appearance of the prolonged nymphal stage seemed to be related with the nutritional condition as well as humidity. The number of eggs laid by a female per day was normally 1 or 2 in D. farinae. However, some females occasionally laid 5 or 6 eggs in a day. At 86% RH, the largest total number of eggs per female (80.6±8.2) was observed. At 76% RH, numated female of D. farinae showed longest longevity of 188.8±60.9 days ranging from 92 to 378 days. The longevity of the female was usually longer than that of the male. D. pteronyssinus showed the shortest developmental duration also at 76% RH. It took 37.1±2.5 days with a range from 30 to 54 days; 6.2±0.3 days for egg, 10.7±0.3 days for larva, 8.6±1.0 days for protonymph and 11.4±2.2 days for tritonymph. The prolonged proto-and tritonymphs were not observed in this species unlike in D. farinae. At 76% RH. the largest total number of eggs, 76.2+22.2,was laid by a female of D. pteronyssinus. At 36% RH, all of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus were dead before the protonymphal stage.

N2  - Discharge rate of five streams infested with Simulium ochraceum was observed every 14 days over 16 months in an area where onchocerciasis is endemic in Guatemala. Three components of specific discharge were proposed : (1) q_A, a constant flow; (2) q_B, a seasonal flow which is charged in the rainy season and discharged exponentially in the early dry season; and (3) q_C, an ephemeral flow which is charged and discharged repeatedly during the rainy season. The greater the q_A, the less was the seasonal fluctuation of total specific discharge. When q_A was 30l/(sec・(km)^2) or greater, the seasonal change was almost negligible. When q_A was 1.9 to 5.0,q_B consisted of a major part of the total specific discharge in the early dry season until q_B decreased below the q_A level in the late dry season. A q_A value less than 0.062 apparently had no effect on stabilizing the discharge rate in the late dry season.

N2  - Ten species of tabanid flies belonging to three genera were collected from cattle in the suburbs of Shibata City in Niigata Prefecture during the period of late July to late September in 1968. Tabanus trigeminus was most abundant occupying more than half of the flies collected, and T. trigonus was next. T. nipponicus which is a dominant species in the pastures of the Tohoku district was rather scarce in this place. The parous rate of the flies was very low at the beginning of the season in T. trigeminus, T. trigonus, T. nipponicus and Atylotus horvathi (all of them are unautogenous species), while it was very high throughout the season in T. kinoshitai and T. rufidens (autogenous species).

N2  - Habitat preferences of rats, R. norvegicus and R. exulans, in housing areas were explained by renal morphologic indices of the ability to conserve urinary water. Indices involving medullary thickness (precent medullary thickness or PMT, ratio of medulla : cortex, and ratio of inner medullary zone : cortex) were significantly larger in R. exulans (for example, PMT±SD=73.2±1.7) than in R. norvegicus (69.4±2.8) at the 1% level. R. exulans thrives even in rural areas with poor water sources owing in part to the efficient kidneys to conserve water. R. norvegicus, on the other hand, flourishes only in urban areas, associated with abundant sources of water supply such as drains and a river.

N2  - Studies were conducted using a laboratory colony of Chironomus yoshimatsui (Diptera : Chironomidae) to investigate the tube-forming ability of the larvae that were experimentally cultured in 11 different materials. A preliminary examination was performed to establish criteria for judging larval mortality due to larvicidal effect. Among the 11 materials used during tubular formation, the larvae constructed tubes in the least amount of time using mud particles (30-150 mesh) collected at their natural habitat, followed by larvae using 0.1,0.2 and 0.3mm glass beads, respectively. Materials containing fine particles, such as silica powder (150,300 mesh) and kaolin (300 mesh) proved to be unsuitable for tubular formation. The larvae failed to construct tubes of glass fiber. Further, water temperature was found to influence tubular formation; lower temperatures (5-20℃) significantly retarded formation as opposed to a higher temperature of 25℃. Laboratory evaluations of 13 organophosphorus (OP) insecticides used against C. yoshimatsui was performed with larval mortality judged on the basis of the success or failure of tubular formation within 48 hours after chemical treatment by using the standard material (0.1mm glass beads). Among the five most active OPs, phoxim (LC_<50>=0.00271ppm) was found to be the most active, followed by chlorpyrifos (LC_<50>=0.0032ppm), chlorpyrifos-methyl (LC_<50>=0.00562ppm), temephos (LC_<50>=0.0112ppm), and finally ethylisoxathion (LC_<50>=0.0136ppm). The water temperature influenced the efficacy of some insecticides : chlorpyrifos-methyl and temephos were significantly more active at 20℃ than at 5℃, whereas the efficacy of fenthion and fenitrothion was not noticeably affected by the water temperature.

N2  - Heavy infestations of larvae of Chironomus yoshimatsui occurred in a sewage treatment plant in Tokyo. In this plant, the final sedimentation tanks, overflow gutters, disinfective tanks, and discharge channels, having relatively low BOD levels, are the specific sites of high densities of the midge. In field studies, the relative efficacy of a WP formulation of temephos and chlorpyrifos-methyl WP against C. yoshimatsui in overflow gutters was assessed by dripping different concentrations of the larvicides for different lengths of time. Although no remarkable difference was observed in the efficacy of the two chemicals against C. yoshimatsui at treatment rates of 0.5ppm for 120min, 1ppm for 60min, 2ppm for 30min, and 4ppm for 15min, chlorpyrifos-methyl showed slightly superior activity than temephos. Successful larval control in the plant was achieved by dripping either chemical from oxidation tanks into connecting channels at a rate of 2ppm for 30min. The two larvicides and the IGR diflubenzuron applied at rates as high as 5ppm for 60min had slight impact on the function of the activated sludge in the system.

N2  - In the laboratory, three organophosphorus insecticides, fenthion, temephos, and chlorpyrifos-methyl were bioassayed against 4th instar larvae Chironomus yoshimatsui collected from ten polluted rivers in the areas of Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, Shizuoka, Aichi, Ehime, and Fukuoka. In most of these rivers, practical control of the midge has been achieved by dripping the larvicides at 1ppm concentration maintained for 60min, but recently the resistance to fenthion in C. yoshimatsui was suspected because of the failure to achieve practical control especially in the Kanda River of Tokyo. The LC_<90> level (48-hr exposure) by fenthion was >0.4ppm against larvae inhabiting most of the rivers; the larvae in four rivers showed similar resistance levels to temephos. In all rivers, the larvae were relatively susceptible to chlorpyrifos-methyl (LC_<50><0.015ppm). Field treatments of a WP formulation of chlorpyrifos-methyl by continuous dripping at rates of 1ppm for 30min, 1.5ppm for 30min, and 1ppm for 60min in seven polluted rivers resulted in excellent larval control of Chironomus yoshimatsui. The larvae were observed to drift downstream immediately after the insecticidal application. The insecticide was carried downstream to more than 800m by the water current. The treatment rate of 1ppm for 60min had no adverse effects on oligochaete worms, Tubifex tubifex and Branchiura sowerbyi, and the gastropod, Physa acuta.

N2  - Two insect growth regulators (IGRs), diflubenzuron and methoprene, were tested against laboratory-reared larvae of Chironomus yoshimatsui. A 25% WP formulation of diflubenzuron resulted in high larval and pupal mortality when 3,7,and 10-day-old larvae were exposed to the chemical solution at a concentration from 0.312 to 2.5ppb for 15,10,and 8 days, respectively. During the same exposure periods to a 10% SR formulation of methoprene in the laboratory, the larvae and pupae suffered from insignificant mortality but the adult emergence remained low at the same concentration prepared. A drip application of diflubenzuron in a river at 1ppm concentration maintained for 60min resulted in excellent larval control with no adult emergence as measured by using adhesive tapes; however, methoprene at same rate of application to the river produced lesser control of the midge.

N2  - In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of skin-reactions to mosquito bites, components in the salivary gland of mosquitoes were studied. Crude extract and lower molecular weight fraction (mol. wt. <6,000) of the salivary gland extract of Culex pipiens pallens showed extravasation activity in the skin of guinea pigs not sensitized previously. But higher molecular weight fraction (mol. wt. >6,000) of the extract did not have the extravasation activity. By the o-phthalaldehyde staining method, histamine was detected in the whole salivary glands of Cx. pipiens pallens soon after their emergence, and the reaction intensity increased when they were mature; in Aedes togoi, the proximal portion of the lateral lobe of the salivary gland reacted strongly. By the azo dye staining method, using α- and β-naphthyl acetate, strong esterase activity was found in the whole salivary gland of Cx. pipiens pallens; in Ae. togoi and Ae. albopictus, only the proximal portions of the salivary glands reacted to some extent. In vitro tests with the salivary gland extract of Cx. pipiens pallens did not exhibit hydrolytic activity on TAME, BTEE and ATEE, and neither anticoagulating activity nor hemolytic activity was observed. Histamine, putrescine, spermine, and spermidine, but not serotonin, were detected in the salivary gland extract by ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Histamine contained in the female body was mainly found in the salivary gland and head.

S-21150 showed higher inhibitory activity than S-21149,and both showed higher activity than methoprene in the artificial and chicken manure mediums on eggs or larvae. By topical application on 4-day-old larvae, S-21149 and S-21150 showed higher inhibitory activity than methoprene, and the adults emerged from the topically treated larvae showed slight decrease in oviposition.

N2  - Collections of chironomid midges and mosquitoes with light traps were carried out in a rice paddy area in the suburbs of Tokushima City, western Japan, in order to elucidate the species and their seasonal prevalence. Five light traps were operated once every week as a rule from April to the end of October 1984. As the results, a total of 32,823 males and 41,691 females of the chironomids as well as 1,822 males and 2,380 females of hte mosquitoes were collected by two light traps. The chironomids were classified into some 40 species, among which the more abundant were Tanytarsus oyamai (34,294 in total), Cricotopus trifasciatus (12,482), Polypedilum kyotoense (11,256), Chironomus circumdatus (5,115), Chironomus kiiensis (4,953), Polypedilum nubifer (2,481) and Chironomus yoshimatsui (2,255). In general, the midges were most abundant from middle of June to the beginning of July, but differences were seen in the seasonal distribution among the species groups. The mosquitoes collected were Culex tritaeniorhynchus (2,274), Culex pipiens (1,501) and Anopheles sinensis (457). The first and the third species were found during the shorter period in midsummer than the second species, which appeared earlier in May and were found to the end of October.

N2  - Morphological features of eggs of three kinds of human lice were studied with the light and scanning electron microscopy. The head and body lice are capable of crossbreeding and they often resemble to each other in their external morphology. However, there was a marked difference between the two forms in the average size of the eggs. Head louse eggs were 830-918μm (888±27) in length and 408-489μm (460±22) in width. Whereas, body louse eggs measured 918-1,142μm (1,004±55) in length and 489-642μm (537±34) in width. On the other hand, the number of aeropyles on the operculum was 7 to 11 (av. 8.7) in head louse eggs, and 12 to 21 (av. 15.4) in body louse eggs. The egg of pubic louse was easily distinguished from eggs of head and body lice in the shape of aeropyle and operculum. The aeropyles of pubic louse egg occupied almost entire surface of its operculum and formed a distinct protuberance at the center. Reticular structure was observed between each of the aeropyles of pubic louse egg.

N2  - Growth-inhibiting effects of two kinds of insect growth regulators (IGR), Altosid 10F (methoprene 10% slow release formulation) and Dimilin (diflubenzuron 25% wettable powder) were evaluated against the last instar larvae of Culicoides circumscriptus Kieffer in the laboratory conditions. Growth-inhibiting effects of these two IGRs were observed as the larval death (including the failure of pupation), the pupal death, the failure of emergence and the deformed adult. Significant differences were found in physiological activities of these two compounds. The effects of Altosid 10F mainly resulted in the death of pupae at higher concentrations and in the deformed adults at lower concentrations, while Dimilin inhibited the pupation. IC_<50> values of Altosid 10F and Dimilin against the last instar larvae of C. circumscriptus were 0.0094ppm and 0.0052ppm, respectively. It was proved that both Altosid 10F and Dimilin shows the high growth-inhibiting effects on C. circumscriptus.

N2  - To evaluate a role of the green pheasant, Phasianus colchicus tohkaidi, as a carrier of Leptotrombidium pallidum, six female birds were shot at Miasa Village and Ina City, Nagano Prefecture, in the late October of 1984,and chiggers parasitic or phoretic on them were examined. Two species of bird chiggers, Helenicula miyagawai and Neoschoengastia shiraii, and five kinds of rodent chiggers, Leptotrombidium intermedium, L. kitasatoi, L. pallidum, Neotrombicula japonica and Gahrliepia saduski, were recorded. All the six birds were infested with L. pallidum with chigger count of 6,1,1,1,5 and 2,respectively. This suggests that the bird plays a role as a carrier in the dispersal of L. pallidum.

The survey was conducted at 41 sites in November-December of 1983 and in January of 1985. The blackflies, larvae and pupae, have been collected only in highlands of the western part of Saitama Prefecture. A total number of 9 species, 111 pupae and 856 larvae were collected from 22 sites. Two species, Prosimulium (Prosimulium) kiotoense and Simulium (Odagumia) aokii, were newly recorded from the prefecture. Predominant species was S. (Simulium) japonicum (46%), followed by S. (Simulium) uchidai (28%) and S. (Simulium) arakawae (18%).

N2  - The first field trial of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) against the Japanese blackfly larvae was carried out in Nagano Prefecture, central Japan. Bti formulation used was SAN 402 I of Sandoz Inc., which contained 2-3×(10)^<10> spores/mg. Four streams were differently treated with Bti. When the same dosage was applied, the longer carry of Bti would be obtained by the longer application time. The concentration of 10ppm for 10 minutes was efficient and recommended for a practical blackfly control.

N2  - In order to investigate an effective control method of blackfly larvae in an onchocerciasis endemic area of Guatemala, large scale stream tests were done in the rainy season using various formulations of temephos. The concentration of temephos had no relationship with its carry within a range of 0.2-2.0ppm/10min. There existed a clear tendency in that the larger the water discharge, the longer was the carry of the insecticide. No distinct difference was observed in efficacy among the four formulations, i.e. solid, water dispersible powders (wdp), emulsifiable concentrates (EC) and oil solution, as also between the two application methods, instantaneous pouring and pouring during a 10min period. It is recommended that in future vector control operations of Guatemalan onchocerciasis temephos wdp packed in a bag containing 1.0-1.5g of the active ingredient should be poured into a stream immediately after mixing it with stream water, regardless of the water discharge of stream. With this mode of application, 50-100m carry would be expected in streams infested with Simulium ochraceum, the principal vector of onchocerciasis.

N2  - Sound trapping of male mosquitoes in the field was improved with the introduction of an artificial swarm marker. A 1×2.5m black cloth was wrapped around the base of a 0.7-m high tripod, and two or four sound traps were hung above the cloth at 0.7 and 1.5m. During dusk, 370Hz sound at 100dB was emitted for 5-sec duration and at 15-sec intervals by each speaker to trap Culex tarsalis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The sound-trapped mosquitoes were mostly 3- and 4-day-old males. The standard deviation of their age was much smaller than that of the resting males. Two weeks of removal sampling of Cx. tarsalis males by 3 or 6 sets of 12 sound traps from a stand of marsh fleabane in California may have reduced the insemination rate of the unfed resting female population from 22% to zero, while the insemination rate remained unchanged at 55% in a comparison area. The removal of sound-sensitive males by this technique may prove more efficient for mosquito control than other male manipulation techniques.

N2  - Fauna and seasonal fluctuation of flies were surveyed in 4 points of swine houses of Takikawa Animal Husbandry Experiment Station, Takikawa, Hokkaido from April to December in 1977 and 1978. Total flies collected by fly-paper strips were 32,506,belonging to 8 families, 13 genera and 20 species, of which Musca domestica constitutes 86.7%, 7.4% in Fannia canicularis, 5.3% in Tephrochlamys japonica, 0.3% in Muscina stabulans and the rest of 16 species constitutes less than 0.1%. Emergence of M. domestica was observed from the end of April to the end of November, F. canicularis from the middle of April to the middle of November, and M. stabulans from the beginning of June to the middle of October. The large populations of those species were seen in July and August. While, the emergence of T. japonica was observed from the early part of April to the end of November, and the first and the second large populations were seen in May and October, respectively.

N2  - The mating, blood feeding and oviposition of Simulium takahasii (Rubtsov), an anautogenous, multivoltine Japanese blackfly, were observed in the laboratory. The results showed that this species readily mates in captivity, and when a male and a female were put together in a small polystyrene tube, the insemination rate was 100% (of 43 pairs examined). In addition, blood feeding was successfully induced on a man's hand and a rabbit's ear on the day of emergence. Fifteen (14.7%) of 102 females fed on a hand, while 6 (37.5%) of 16 females fed on a rabbit. Three or 4 days after the blood feeding, oviposition was observed with 11 inseminated females. However, 2 females which had not been inseminated failed to oviposit. A mean of 158 eggs was laid by a female which had fed on a man, whereas 195 eggs were deposited by a female which had fed on a rabbit. Five to 12 days after oviposition, 80.9-97.9% of eggs laid by 7 females hatched, although the rate was only 38.3% with an egg batch laid by 1 female. Thus, it was found that S. takahasii is a candidate species suitable for laboratory colonization.

N2  - An ecological study of Leptoconops nipponensis oshimaensis (Takaoka and Hayashi, 1977) was carried out at Katoku, Amami-oshima Island. The survey of the seasonal prevalence of adult midges was made during the period from February 1980 to July 1981. The adults were captured by light-traps from late March to late August, and a peak was observed between mid April and mid May. An hourly biting catch was carried out in April 1980,and two peaks of biting activity were observed, in early morning and late afternoon. The survey on the larval habitat was carried out in April 1981. The majority of larvae and pupae were found in the sandy zone with Imperata cylindrica var. major along the beach and the windbreak forest zone (Casuarina equisetifolia, etc.). No larvae nor pupae were found in clay, sandy beach, sandy river side, lawn and sandy grassy zone with Carex breviculmis var. fibrillosa in the windbreak forest.

N2  - In a quadrat sampling made in a 2.4-m stretch. Simulium ochraceum larvae were recovered only from shallow rapids. Lead plates were designed for collecting larvae attached on them. The highest larval density was recorded from the lowest depth (0.2-2.0cm) and the highest velocity (41-66cm/sec). The density increased with velocity increment, but decreased with depth increment. No larva was recorded in the stream of the current velocity less than 10cm/sec. Comparing among the five sampling stretches of 20m each, the increase in discharge was associated with increase both in depth and current velocity, but decrease in larval density, while increase in slope was associated with decrease in depth but increase in both current velocity and mean larval density.

N2  - Nine species in 3 families of Diptera were determined as the prey of the common yellow dung-fly Scathophaga stercoraria. Eight of these species were recorded as the prey for the first time. Preys for three species of yellow dung-flies, S. scybalaria, S. stercoraria and S. suilla, were serologically determined by the use of micro-Ouchterlony method. Positive reactions were observed against Musca domestica, M. bezzii, M. hervei and Morellia saishuensis in both male and female S. scybalaria and female S. stercoraria, and against M. domestica and M. hervei in male S. stercoraria. No positive reactions were found against these muscid flies in S. suilla. No distinct seasonal changes in the blood source were found in any species of dung-flies examined.

N2  - The tabanid fauna of Okushiri Island, Hokkaido, Japan, was surveyed by collecting female adults with a mosquito-net trap baited with dry ice and by digging larvae and pupae with hand shovels, on August 6 and 7,1983. A total of 544 female adults of 9 species belonging to 3 genera and 39 immatures of 3 species of Tabanus were collected. Tabanus nipponicus, T. chrysurus and T. trigeminus were ubiquitous and predominant. The faunal make-up of this island with a considerable abundance of anautogenous tabanid population markedly differs from that of Rishiri and Rebun Islands. The influence of the livestock farming for the establishment of the tabanid fauna of this island was discussed.

The eggs were laid on the underside of leaves of 6 kinds of plants, mainly Phragmites communis Trinius, at the average height of 84.5cm above the ground. The egg-batches were light yellow, and nearly conical in shape with 3 to 4 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 525. Seven batches out of nine unhatched ones were parasitized by wasps (Telenomus angustatus). Morphological differences of the egg-batches among closely related 3 species, T. katoi, T. sapporoenus and T. chrysurinus, were interpreted.

N2  - More than 500 patients of tsutsugamushi disease have been reported in Kagoshima Prefecture since 1955. We have, therefore, made a series of investigations in an attempt to determine the vector trombiculid species in this prefecture. Trombiculid larvae were collected from wild rodents, from the soil of endemic areas, and from the black bakelite plates set on the ground. Also attempted were the isolation of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (R. t.) from the collected mites and the detection of anti-R. t. antibodies from the sera of the sentinel mice exposed to trombiculid larvae in the endemic foci. As the results, 351 fed larvae of trombiculid mites consisting of 2 genera and 9 species were collected from the wild rodents, and 544 unfed larvae belonging to 2 genera and 7 species were recovered by the bakelite plate method; Leptotrombidium scutellare and L. pallidum were included in both of these groups of mites collected. However, the isolation of R. t. from the unfed L. scutellare was unsuccessful. Three out of 174 sera of the experimental mice exposed to trombiculid larvae in the endemic foci were positive for R. t. antigens by the indirect immunofluorescence method.

N2  - We have successfully established laboratory colonies of Toxorhynchites towadensis, Tx. undescribed sp. (Okinawa), and Tx. manicatus yaeyamae. The first 2 species, mated in a large cage (60×60×75cm) covered by a black polyvinyl sheet with a small window at the top. Females and males of these species often flew towards the light entering through the window, and this increased the chance of mating. With a slight modification of the methods used for anopheline mosquitoes, however, artificial mating was employed for Tx. m. yaeyamae, and also for Tx. sp. (Okinawa) when natural mating was insufficient. When the mating was successful, enough eggs were obtained to sustain the colony even in a smaller cage (20×30×20cm). The average duration from egg hatch to adult emergence was 19-20 days for these Toxorhynchites species.

N2  - The age structure of male populations responding to sound were studied with five species of age-known, virgin and non-virgin males in the laboratory (Cx. p. molestus, Cx. p. pallens, Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus and An. stephensi), and with resting, swarming and sound-trapped males in the nature (Cx. tarsalis, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Ae. melanimon). The age of the field-collected males was determined by counting the daily cuticular layers of the mesothoracic furca. The response to sound was greatest for 2-day-old Cx. p. molestus males and for 3 and 4-day-old males of the other six species. Sound responsiveness of the laboratory males decreased as a function of age and mating experience. The fecundity of male Ae. aegypti, but not Cx. p. molestus, was higher for sound-attracted males than males not attracted to sound.

N2  - To determine the susceptibility of the wild Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, to warfarin, a no-choice feeding test with a bait containing 0.005% warfarin was carried out using wild Norway rats collected from several places of Japan from 1981. So far as the results obtained, mean days to death in both Norway rats of most test localities and laboratory rats were approximately within five days and this values seem to indicate a standard susceptibility of Norway rats in Japan. On the other hand, susceptibility of a Norway rat population of Yumenoshima to warfarin was measured using WHO procedure, and LFP_<50>, LFP_<98> and its upper 95% confidence limit were calculated by Litchfield and Wilcoxon method. These values were 1.85,7.9 and 12.1 days, respectively, of the three, the latter two were longer than those of warfarin-susceptible populations in Europe and U. S. A. The Norway rat population of Yumenoshima could be controlled with 0.025% warfarin in 1983. Therefore, a feeding period on 0.005% warfarin to detect the appearance of warfarin-resistant strain in Japan should be investigated, although a six-day feeding test has been adopted usually in Europe and U. S. A.

N2  - The egg-batches of Chrysops vanderwulpi kitaensis Hayakawa, 1982,and C. nigripes Zetterstedt, 1840 were collected from marsh plants in Hokkaido in the late July of 1982. Thirty-three egg-batches of C. vanderwulpi kitaensis were found on almost erected leaves or stems of 5 species of plants, mostly of Phragmites communis Trinius, which grew in water off-shore. On the other hand, two egg-batches were found on the underside of horizontal leaves of Sium suave Walker. The average height of oviposition sites was 14.1cm and 22.5cm above the water surface in C. vanderwulpi kitaensis and C. nigripes, respectively. The egg-batches of both species were quite similar each other; dark brown to black in color, and flat and very elongated in shape with monolayer of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 85.5 and 99.0 in C. vanderwulpi kitaensis and C. nigripes, respectively. Eggs of both species were parasitized by wasps.

N2  - Two females of strange cockroach were captured by the workers of Chuwa Fumigation Co. in a storehouse of Nishi-Kaigan-dori, Moji-ku, Kitakyushu City on Aug. 10,1984. The rigid identification study on the insects showed that they were exactly identical with the paratype of Parcoblatta kyotensis Asahina. This finding lends a strong confirmation to the fact that P. kyotensis is distributed in Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu.

N2  - The egg-batches of Tabanus trigeminus Coquillett, 1898 were collected from marsh plants in Shizukuishi-cho, Iwate-ken in July, 1978. The eggs were found on the underside of leaves of 8 plants, mainly Phragnites communis Trinius and Iris sanguinea Donn., at the average height of 46cm above the water surface. The egg-batches were grey to brownish black in color with yellowish white cements among individual eggs, and roughly conical in shape with 3 to 4 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 611. All egg-batches were parasitized by wasps. One case of oviposition behavior was observed during the survey.

N2  - In the experimental infection of Brugia malayi to two strains of Armigeres subalbatus, 406 and Rendaiji strains, 58.2% and 63.3% of the total number of filarial larvae were encapsulated mostly in the abdominal haemocoel 24hr after infective blood meal respectively. The encapsulation was also observed in the mid-gut and thorax, but with fewer larvae and in less intensity. On the contrary, smaller numbers of B. pahangi larvae, 2.8% and 17.7% in 406 and Rendaiji strains respectively, were encapsulated in this species of mosquito which is known susceptible to the parasite. It was indicated that the encapsulation of B. malayi larvae in the haemocoel of Ar. subalbatus was linked in a restricting factor in the larval migration from the haemocoel into the thorax.

N2  - In comparison with fenitrothion and diazinon, various types of pyrethroid compounds were evaluated for their control efficacy against Tyrophagus putrescentiae and Dermatophagoides farinae by the culture mixing method. Some new findings were obtained in the study on the pyrethroid structure-activity relationships. Against T. putrescentiae, esters of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid derivatives with phenoxybenzyl alcohol such as phenothrin, fenpropathrin, K-1917,permethrin, KA-1918,K-1919,K-1920,and K-1810 were found to be effective. The activity of these compounds at a concentration of 500ppm was equivalent to that of the reference compounds, fenitrothion and diazinon. The results also showed that the pyrethroid compounds were generally more effective to D. farinae than T. putrescentiae. In particular, phenothrin, cyphenothrin, fenpropathrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, KU-1686 and fluvalinate exhibited high control efficacy against D. farinae at a concentration of 100ppm, being as active as diazinon. The introduction of a cyano group into the α-position of the benzylalcohol moiety of tested pyrethroid compounds usually caused reduction in control efficacy against these mites; this is a different phenomenon from that observed in the tests of these compounds for the insecticidal activity. Moreover, some pyrethroid compounds which were reported as having high acaricidal activity against tetranychid mites on plants were not always effective against mites in the house, indicating that there were some differences in the mode of action of pyrethroids among mite species, as well as between mites and insects.

N2  - The use of insecticide-treated curtain made of wide mesh net has been developed for the vector mosquito control, as an alternative to the indoor residual spray. The nets, which had an opening large enough to allow mosquitoes to pass through, were impregnated with the candidate insecticides, fenitrothion and phenothrin, at diffent doses. Contact toxicity tests were conducted with 3-5 day old unfed female Anopheles stephensi. The mortality was observed periodically. As a result, three types of nylon net treated with 1.0g/m^2 of both chemicals retained their insecticidal effectiveness for more than 34 weeks. In order to assess behaviour of the mosquitoes under influence of insecticides, a series of cage tests were carried out in laboratory using an apparatus which is composed of a plastic bag served as a release chamber and of a wire cage (30×30×30cm) served as a baited chamber. The netting, impregnated with the insecticides, was interposed between a cage of avid mosquitoes and a baited chamber. Mosquitoes were released at 3p.m. and recovered at 10a.m. of the following day. The number of dead and live, fed and unfed mosquitoes which were found in each chamber were counted and recorded separately. In the control apparatus, fed mosquitoes rested in the baited chamber. However, the engorged females were driven out from the baited chamber into the released chamber in the apparatus treated with either chemical, at the dose of 0.04g/m^2,at one month post impregnation. There was a reduced entry of mosquitoes into the phenothrin-treated chamber. It appears that phenothrin has a deterrent effect, preventing the mosquitoes from entering through the treated net.

N2  - The comparative toxicities of some synthetic pyrethroids in the housefly, Musca domestica L. (Lab-em-7-em strain), were studied over 24hr (injection) and 48hr (topical). Results indicated that the housefly was very susceptible to knockdown (KD) by the synthetic pyrethroids although the 24 and 48hr topical LD_<50> values showed little difference from that of fenitrothion, the comparative OP insecticide used in the tests. The most toxic compound in topical application was cypermethrin while fenvalerate was most toxic in injection. In the topical application treatments, α-cyano substituted compounds were more effective both at kill and at KD than non-substituted compounds, except for S-5439 and fenvalerate where the reverse situation was predominant. The relationship between the topical and injection LD_<50> values suggested that some of the synthetic pyrethroids (i.e. phenothrin, cyphenothrin, cypermethrin and S-5439), as well as fenitrothion, could penetrate the housefly cuticle more easily than lindane, permethrin, fenvalerate and fenpropathrin. The general order of toxicity of the tested insecticides, based on the 24 and 48hr LD_<50> s was as follows : cypermethrin>>cyphenothrin&ge;fenpropathrin&ge;fenitrothion>fenvalerate&ge;S-5439&ge;lindane&ge;permethrin>phenothrin. Fenitrothion had very little or no KD effects in the housefly.

N2  - An investigation was made to know the life history of Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich, 1930) in Hachijo Island, Tokyo, from February 1981 to May 1982. A trap baited with horse meat was set at five different altitudes, 50m, 200m, 400m, 600m and 800m, of Mt. Hachijo-Fuji. The number of flies captured was counted once a month. The larvae and pupae which had bred from meat in the trap were also counted and transferred into a separate trap for emergence. The number of the flies gradually increased from foot to top of the mountain during March to May. Following the rainy season in June, the number decreased and only one female was trapped at alt. 600m during August to September. Some females were captured again at alt. 600m and 800m in October. This suggests that some of mated females can estivate in the mountainous area above alt. 600m where it is usually cool and foggy during summer and mossforests develop. A few adults and a number of pupae were found even in winter in the trap of station 600m. The upper region of the mountain may be considered as a primary habitat of this blow fly. After estivation some females probably migrated for spawning eggs from the mountainous habitat and appeared in the town at alt. 50m. They may be successful in finding enough foods and breeding places around the human dwellings in winter and spring. The 74% of the flies were trapped in a temperature range of 2.0-9.0℃ in minimum and 16.5-23.0℃ in maximum and in a range of day length 10 : 30-14 : 20. This also suggests that the adult has a preference for such climate as being rather cool before sunrise and warm in daytime in spring and autumn.

Selection was performed in the concentration which resulted in more than 80% mortality to the adult houseflies by topical application. Present results indicated that susceptibility of these houseflies to pyrethroids did not decrease during successive selection for 10 generations with tetramethrin, 20 generations with resmethrin, or 30 generations with permethrin, respectively.

N2  - The spray of the Asian whipscorpion, Typopeltis stimpsoni (Wood, 1862), was investigated chemically using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The spray mainly consisted of acetic acid, caprylic acid and water. No other fatty acids and volatile materials could be detected in the spray. Contents of the major components were determined by mass-fragmentography and the following result was obtained : acetic acid, 78.3% (v/v); caprylic acid, 5.8% (v/v); water, 15.9% (v/v). These values are quite similar to those of the American species, Mastigoproctus giganteus (Lucas, 1835) and those of the other Asian whipscorpion, T. crucifer Pocock, 1894.

Six simuliid species (Simulium uchidai, S. aureohirtum, S. bidentatum, S. aokii, S. arakawae and S. japonicum) were collected for the first time from this archipelago. S. aureohirtum proved to be autogenus. The pupal gills of S. japonicum from Fukue Island were different from those on Nakamichi Island. Infections of blackfly larvae by parasites were rarely observed; out of 236 simuliid larvae examined, only one and five larvae were infected with mermithid and microsporidan parasites, respectively.

Five blackfly species (Prosimulium kiotoense, Simulium subcostatum, S. uchidai, S. arakawae and S. japonicum) were found, of which P. kiotoense was newly recorded from this island. This result brougth the total number of Simuliidae species in Oki Islands to nine. Mermithid and microsporidan parasites commonly infected P. kiotoense and S. japonicum larvae. Fungal infection was rare, one of 136 P. kiotoense and two of 154 S. japonicum larvae being infected.

N2  - The predatory ability of three species of yellow dung-fly (Scathophaga scybalaria, S. stercoraria and S. suilla) was investigated in the laboratory. The functional responses of male S. stercoraria was the best among the three species. Female S. suilla were considered to be the least effective predators under the experimental conditions. Predatory behaviour was also investigated. Both sexes of all three species fed usually from only one, but sometimes two body parts, of prey captured at high prey densities. The neck of the prey was the primary site for perforation and the face was the second for both sexes of the three species examined. The following sites of perforation seemed to be variable especially in S. scybalaria and S. stercoraria.

N2  - Laboratory studies were done to assess the effects of larval density within cow dung on the growth and development of Musca hervei Villeneuve. Various numbers of eggs were reared with a fixed amount of reconstructed cow dung. In general, high larval densities beyond a certain level caused a large decrease in sizes of subsequent pupae and adults, despite the fact that the ratio of pupal length to width was almost constant for all sizes in both sexes. Very small puparia, however, were thin-walled and fragile. These stunted pupae had a tendency to emerge into small adults, having corresponding size in heads and wings with the pupal size, in a shorter period than normal ones. There seemed to be a positive relationship between the pupal size and the survival period of subsequent adult flies in both sexes.

N2  - The sarcophagine flesh flies have been classified into a lot of genera by the combination of the external and trivial genital characters on the basis of the classification by Rohdendorf (1937). As his system was not based on the phylogeny, there have been many problems especially about the delineation of the genera. The authors examined in detail 86 out of 129 species of the Sarcophaginae of the Oriental region, and propose systematics weighted by the homology of the male phallic structure after Roback's method (1954). The Sarcophaginae of the Oriental region is divided into three tribes, namely Raviniini, Tephromyiini and Sarcophagini, and consists of four genera, namely Ravinia (1 species included), Blaesoxipha (7 spp.), Harpagophalla (6 spp.), Sarcophaga (112 spp.) and unplaced (3 spp.). These genera are grouped by the presence and the shape of the median process and the styli according to the result of the evolution of the ventral sclerotization.

N2  - The susceptibility of 2 strains (Oahu and Hyogo strains) of Aedes albopictus to oral infection with chikungunya virus was compared. These strains showed different infection threshold and final content of the virus. Oahu strain was much susceptible than the Hyogo strain. Virus titers in individual mosquito of the Hyogo strain on 14th day post-infection ranged continuously between (10)^1 and (10)^3 PFU per mosquito. On the contrary, those of the Oahu strain were fallen into 3 groups such as negative (non-infective), low virus titer ((10)^3-(10)^4 PFU) and high virus titer ((10)^6-(10)^7 PFU).

Mean number of larvae per dip was proportional to larval density at least within the density range 25-800 of each instar per m^2. The dipping efficiency was not influenced by the growth stages of rice plant.

N2  - The females of Periplaneta americana and P. australasiae in the first stage of oothecal formation were irradiated on the head with UV rays to examine the daily change of their sensitivity to the UV rays. One group of these female cockroaches was reared under the photo-regimen of 12L : 12D, the light phase was continued from 7 : 00 to 19 : 00. The other group was kept in the light phase of 5 : 00 to 17 : 00. A 10-watt mercury lamp which emits UV rays mostly of 253.7nm was used for irradiation at the rate of 100μW. (cm)^<-2>. (sec)^<-1> for 10min as reported previously. The results of UV irradiation experiments on the head of both the groups revealed a daily change of UV sensitivity which was expressed as various inhibitory effects on the oothecal formation, depending on the time of the day when they were irradiated. The sensitivity of cockroaches to the UV irradiation seemed very low at the early light phase, but when irradiated during 5hr prior to light-off, they responded to the irradiation by depositing more or less abnormal oothecae. During the first 4hr of light phase, the inhibitory effect of the UV rays could not be detected in the females even when they were exposed with a larger dose of the UV rays. In contrast, when the females were severed at the optic tracts and irradiated on the head in the first 4hr of light phase, they deposited abnormal oothecae. From these results it is suggested that the physiological mechanism controlling the circadian rhythms in the cockroaches might have intercepted the effect of UV rays during the early light phase.

N2  - The immature stages of three muscine species, Pyrellia tateyamensis Shinonaga, Mesembrina resplendens Wahlberg and Huckettomyia watanabei Pont et Shinonaga, occurring from wild brown bear dung were newly described and their characteristics of taxonomic and biological significance were discussed. The third instar larva of P. tateyamensis was of typical Muscini-type, and can be distinguished from those of the known Dasyphora-larva in having a pair of extraanal papillae. This larva also differs from that of P. cadaverina (Linnaeus) in the characteristics of posterior spiracles. The larval mode of life of M. resplendens was trimorphic obligatory coprophagous. The third instar larva of resplendens is partially related to those of Hydrotaeini and Phaoniinae-Mydaeinae, and can be distinguished from that of a Palaearctic species, M. meridiana Linnaeus in having doubled number of branches on anterior spiracles and by the characteristics of posterior spiracles, but extremely resemble that of M. mystacea Linnaeus described from Russia. Egg of H. watanabei was of typical muscine-type, but the larval characteristics have a close relationship to those of Phaoniinae and Mydaeinae. The third instar larva of this species seems to be facultative carnivorous.

Only 11 egg-batches were collected during the period; 7 from 5 kinds of plants (mainly Cyperus microiria Steud.) growing in the pasture, 2 from 1 kind of plant in the forest, and 2 from 1 kind of plant in the pond indicating not so strong selectivity of oviposition plants as that of aquatic species in general. The height of oviposition sites ranged from 18 to 192cm above the ground or water surface. The egg-batches were light yellowish brown in color, and roughly conical or semioval in shape with 3 to 4 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 278. Seven batches (64%) were parasitized by wasps.

N2  - Two males of the parasitic calliphorid fly Melinda itoi Kano 1962 were obtained from the slug, Incilaria bilineata (Benson) in April, 1976. The slug was one of those which were collected on March 25,1976 in the cracks of the bark of an old Ume-tree (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc.) growing beside the brook of a hilly village (Ohyagi, Moroyama-cho, Saitama) and kept alive in our laboratory at 25℃ from that time on. The movement of the maggots in the slug body was recognized three days after collection. Two days after that, they came out of the slug and pupated on the bottom of the glass container. After 12 days (April 11), the adult flies appeared. So far as we know, this is the first case of the parasitic fly emerged from the slug in Japan.

N2  - Mite faunas in house dust samples collected from homes of children with Kawasaki disease (Mucocutaneous lymphnode syndrome; MCLS) living in the southern parts of Japan were examined. Average number of mites contained in 0.5g of these dust samples was 657 (n=24,range 40-3608). The number was not significantly different from that of our previous report in Kanto district. The number was not correlated with risk scores of MCLS (r=0.050). There was no specific mite species in dusts from homes of children with Kawasaki disease. The number of Dermatophagoides farinae was lower in dusts from Kawasaki disease than that from control dusts of previous report. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was found in all house dust samples. Rate of mites of Cryptostigmata seemed larger than that of our previous report. In summary, mite fauna in dust samples from homes of children with Kawasaki disease was not conspicuously different from the fauna of normal control house dusts in our previous reports.

Either when the mosquitoes were fed on methoprene with sugar solution or when they were exposed to filter paper treated with methoprene, follicle maturation was varied and oviposition was inhibited. Moreover, it was confirmed that methoprene applied topically at 0.01μg/female was affected reproduction. Upon dissection the females which had oviposited were seen to have eggs retained in their ovaries, whereas those which had not oviposited contained follicles at various stages of maturation.

N2  - The development and loss of insecticide resistance in a field population of the houseflies, Musca domestica, at Hokko, a waste disposal site in Osaka Bay was studied in relation to insecticide application and state of the resistance in the surrounding urban area. The resistance developed to trichlorfon, fenitrothion, fenthion, dichlorvos and diazinon after two years application of trichlorfon, and such resistance remained in an equilibrium for subsequent one year after the spray of calclofos and dichlorvos was substituted for that of trichlorfon. However, the resistance was not observed to two pyrethroids, namely allethrin and phthalthrin. After the insecticidal pressure was weakened in the fourth year through reducing the amount of chemicals sprayed, the resistance to organophosphorus compounds except for fenitrothion and diazinon was lowered a little. The prevalence of resistance could be explained by first, the accumulated amount of insecticides sprayed since the beginning of application to the collection date of each colony and second, the amount of chemicals sprayed during 7 days prior to the each collection date. The former and the latter may be reflect the history of selection and the intensity of direct selection pressure in each generation of insects, respectively. Three urban colonies showed a lowr level of resistance as compared to Hokko population in the fourth year, but the diluting effect which was considered to be caused by immigrant houseflies from urban area to Hokko Site was not suggested to be so serious as compared to the effect of selection pressure.

N2  - Field surveys were carried out monthly during the period from August 1981 to September 1982 to add to the basic knowledge of the vectors of tsutsugamushi disease in Nagano Prefecture, where outbreaks of the disease were reported in the spring of 1981 after a lapse of 14 years. Field mice and voles were trapped alive at stations selected mostly in grasslands in Miasa Village and Iida City. Preliminary or additional surveys were also done at irregular intervals in these areas and in Yamanouchi Town and Matsumoto City. From four kinds of field rodents examined, a total of 51,548 chiggers comprising three genera and 12 species was collected and identified. Among them, Leptotrombidium pallidum, L. intermedium, L. fuji, and Gahrliepia saduski were the predominant species in this order. L. scutellare, one of the known vectors in Japan, was not collected during the study, suggesting that L. pallidum would have played the role of vector in the recent reoccurrence of tsutsugamushi disease in Nagano Prefecture. Remarkable difference was observed among the average numbers of chiggers taken from different kinds of hosts. Conspicuous variations in host perference of some chigger species were also observed depending on the localities of collection. Habitat specificity was distinctly demonstrated by the fact that the faunal compositions of chigger species were closely related with the topographical features of the lands surveyed. Seasonal fluctuation of chiggers also differed depending on the localities of the survey. For example, average number of L. pallidum on the rodents showed a peak of occurrence in the late fall at the stations in Iida, while the same species of chigger had two peaks, one in spring and the other in autumn, at the stations in Miasa. The importance of studying the favorable habitats for the vector was discussed from the epidemiological viewpoints.

A good correlation was observed between ^<14>C-methyl malathion degrading activity and aliesterase activity of enzymes separated by thin-layer agar gel electrophoresis. Difference in the sensitivity of acetylcholinesterase to malaoxon was not involved in the resistance mechanism of this insect to malathion.

N2  - Specific distinctness was evaluated by laboratory hybridization between members of the Anopheles hyrcanus sibling species group distributed in East Asia. The following 7 members of the species group, including vectors of malaria or filariasis, were dealt with : An. sinensis and An. lesteri of Japan; An. argyropus and An. nitidus of Malaysia; and An. nigerrimus, An. crawfordi, and An. peditaeniatus of Indonesia. They were reproductively isolated from each other due to zygotic mortality or hybrid sterility. The results provided evidence indicating substantial specific differentiation among the 7 members of this group. The cross between An. crawfordi and An. lesteri as well as between An. nigerrimus and An. nitidus gave sterile F_1 hybrids. Males of the F_1 hybrid between An. lesteri and An. crawfordi were crossed with females of the parental species, which laid unhatched eggs. This indicates the possibility that the hybrid males will be utilized for genetic control of their parental species.

N2  - The breeding and emerging periods of Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich) were studied along with the fluctuation of adults for tracing its life cycle by using both baited and emergence traps in the backyard of the National Institute of Health, Tokyo, from December 1981 to March 1983. Seasonal activity of the adult in each year was similar, which confirmed the previous works reported from the same locality. A number of both sexes were trapped from March to July, and a large amount of females were caught in September to December. The first flight in early fall represents only aged females attracted. The breeding stage first appeared in the beginning of September and ended in the middle of coming May. Early fall generation derived from eggs deposited in September quickly grew up and emerged as adults in late fall (October to November). Prepupae or pupae of late fall generation derived from eggs in November to December became dormant during winter. After the dormancy, most adults emerged in March, though a few appeared in the end of January and the beginning of February. Spring generation from eggs in February to May normally developed within relatively short periods (0.5-1.5 months). No developing stages were observed from late May to early September, although male and female adults were trapped until the end of July. From the above, it is concluded that this blow fly can develop in the Tokyo area during 8.5 months from September to the middle of May excepting the coldest season in which dormant prepupae and pupae are dominant. The first appearance of aged females in September may suggest the adult aestivation in Aldrichina grahami.

N2  - Carpoglyphus lactis is a stored product pest distributed in many countries and is known as the pest of soybeans paste, "miso, " and raw sugar especially in Japan. To observe the effect of relative humidity on the life cycle of C. lactis, the mite was reared in a glass tube individually under the conditions of various humidities, 58.5% R.H., 74.0% R.H., 84.0% R.H. and 94.0% R.H. at a constant temperature of 25℃. The food for the mite was a mixture of sugar and dried yeast (1 : 1). The reproduction of mite generally has a relationship with hatch rate, survival rate, the length of each developmental stage, sex ratio and fecundity. The hatch rates and the period of egg stage were nearly the same in all humidities. The survival rate from larva to adult was higher as the humidity increased. In 58.5% R.H., the all hatched larvae were dead at the beginning of larval stage. In 94.0% R.H., the durations of larval, protonymphal and tritonymphal stage were 2.0,1.3 and 1.7 days, respectively. It took 7.8 days to develop from egg to adult and was shortest among 4 conditions. The number of eggs laid per female in its life span was 193.4 most in 94.0% R.H. The length and the width of idiosoma at each developmental stage in 74.0% R.H. was short compared with that of the other conditions. The sex ratio was almost the same in 3 conditions. The deutonymph (hypopus) was not found during this experiment. It was suggested that the condition of 94.0% R.H. was the optimum humidity for individual rearing of C. lactis in these experimental conditions.

N2  - Tabanus tokaraensis n. sp. is described based on the female materials from Kuchinoshima, Nakanoshima and Takarajima, Tokara Islands, Japan. This species is very closely related to Tabanus rufidens (Bigot, 1887), but can be easily distinguished from it by the shape of middle callus on frons which is fused broadly with basal callus. Key to the 10 Japanese species belonging to rufidens group of the genus Tabanus is presented.

N2  - Cheyletus forsis Oudemres, a predacious mite of the family Cheyletidae, caused itchy dermatitis on the arms of 5 out of 12 volunteers 24hr after the application of 6 live mites, consisting of 5 Cheyletus fortis (C.f.) and one Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank)(T.p.), for each person. These mites were applied to the small closed area of the skin separately for 24hr. On the areas where T.p. were applied, no lesions were observed. The lesions, caused by C.f., varied from slightly edematous erythema of 2 to 3mm in diameter to highly edematous erythema with central vesiculation of 7 to 8mm, depending on the sensitivity of the volunteers to the mites. The biopsy specimen revealed epidermal spongiosis, intraepidermal spongiotic vesicles, subepidermal edema and perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration with eosinophils, and corresponded to that of allergic contact dermatitis, the IV type of allergy. The results of the closed patch test on the normal skin of the same volunteers using the homogenate of C.f. and T.p. were almost negative. But, on the test sites, where cornified layer were previously peeled off with Scotch tape, positive reactions were obtained 24hr after the application of the C.f. homogenate for 9 volunteers out of 12. These results mean that C.f. causes dermatitis in man and this mechanism is based on the IV type of allergy. The antigen of C.f. is supposed to be high molecular substance which can not pass through the stratum corneum.

N2  - In order to clarify distribution of blackfly larvae in relation to channel slope and stream discharge, studies were carried out in Guatemala in streams infested with Simulium ochraceum, S. metallicum, S. horacioi, S. callidum and others. A total of 485 larval collections were made during the dry season from 90 sampling units each consisting of 20m stretch. It was found that the incidence rate of each species was regulated by both channel slope and stream discharge. The higher-than-80% incidence rate was observed at the sites with high slope (20-40°) and medium discharge (0.3-3l/s) for S. ochraceum, with low slope (0-25°) and medium to large discharge (0.3-30l/s) for S. metallicum, and with high slope (20-40°) and small discharge (0.03-1l/s) for S. horacioi. The higher-than-50% rate for S. callidum was obtained at the sites with medium slope (5-25°) and large discharge (1-30l/s). S. ochraceum was positively associated with all other species. S. metallicum and S. callidum showed strong positive association with each other, but negative one with S. horacioi. Three types of dominant species pairs were most frequently observed, i.e., the horacioi-ochraceum pair at high slope and small discharge, the ochraceum-metallicum pair at low slope and small discharge, and the metallicum-callidum pair at low slope and large discharge. Species composition in tributaries was successfully explained by their mean slope and geometric mean discharge.

N2  - Laboratory and field tests were performed in order to establish the practical usage of a juvenoid, methoprene as an alternative fly control agent at poultry houses. Effectiveness of methoprene was evaluated based on the inhibition of adult emergence of the house fly, Musca domestica L. with a 10% slow release formulation, Altosid 10F^[○!R]. In the laboratory test with 6-day-old larvae of the field strains the median inhibitory concentration of Altosid 10F in larval medium with poultry droppings was 1.32ppm in active ingredient. The persistence of Altosid 10F in the above medium under 25℃ and 16L-8D photoperiod was assayed with 6-day-old larvae on the 14th, 29th, and 50th day after application. It was assumeP that Altosid 10F in the medium persisted as much as 52.6,43.5,and 19.2% activity of original pereparation on the 14th, 29th, and 50th day, respectively. In the field test 50,25,and 12.5ppm of Altosid 10F were sprayed at 2 liters per square meter by an electric power sprayer onto poultry droppings. Among them 50ppm spray demonstrated an effective control for longer suppression of adult emergence. The emergence inhibition of pupae collected from poultry droppings treated with 50ppm of Altosid 10F were 88.1,74.2,and 46.5% on 7,13 and 19th day after treatment, respectively. The susceptibility of two field strains of fly against methoprene and four commercialized organophosphorus insecticides, diazinon, trichlorfon, dichlorbos, and fenitrothion was evaluated and compared with that of the susceptible laboratory strain, Takatsuki strain, by topical application on 6-day-old larvae. Both field strains indicated high resistance more than 47 fold to all tested organophosphorus insecticides showing maximum resistance level as 330 fold to trichlorfon but no appreciable resistance to methoprene was observed. Therefore, we suggest that methoprene does not have a cross-resistace relation with four tested organophosphorus insecticides in these two field strains of house fly.

N2  - Egg-batches of Silvius oshimaensis Hayakawa, Takahasi and Suzuki, 1982 were collected from citrus orchard in Amami Island in May of 1973 and 1982. The eggs were found on the underside of leaves of Citrus poonensis Tanaka, that were parallel or somewhat inclined to the ground at the average height of 198cm above the ground. The egg-batches were yellow or yellowish orange in color, and rather pyramidal in shape with 2 to 3 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 419. None of the egg-batches was parasitized by wasps. It may be due to the application of insecticides at this orchard.

N2  - A blood-sucking leech, Hirudo nipponia Whitman, at the early stage was found at the conjunctiva of the left eye of a 63-year-old woman, which caused a heavy lacrimation and a sense of the foreign body without pain. The leech was removed with forceps after it was anesthetized with 0.4% narcotic benoxyl given in the eye. Symptoms on the part of the eye completely ceased after the leech was removed. It is assumed that the leech infestation occurred in a paddy field during her working there.

N2  - On-foot surveys were made for the purpose of mapping perennial streams infected with Simulium ochraceum in an endemic area of onchocerciasis in Guatemala. Of 246 perennial streams (144.4km) found in 477(km)^2,119 (48.4%) or 27.8km (19.3%) were found infested with S. ochraceum. S. ochraceum larvae were found mainly from older impermeable rocks such as Tertiary lahars and lavas, arkosic conglomerate and Cretaceous granite. Although recent volcanic rocks have very few perennial streams due to permeability, they are important as water reservoirs for the underlying impermeable rocks. Quarternary alluvium showed high stream density, but no S. ochraceum larva was found from these streams, due probably to small channel slope. The area with Tertiary lahars and lavas is the most important bed of ochraceum-breeding streams, which roughly coincides with the onchocerciasis endemic area. Of total 1469 channel segments in this area, only 203 (13.8%) had perennial streams, of which 108 (53.2%) were infested with S. ochraceum. With increment of the channel order, the raito of channel segments with perennial streams increased, while, on the contrary, the ratio of perennial streams with S. ochraceum larvae decreased. No S. ochraceum larva was found in the fourth and fifth order channels. S. ochraceum larvae were found mainly in the uppermost part of the stream network, immediately below headsprings. The headsprings were found arranged nearly horizontally on the elevations 900m, 1100m and 1300-1460m above sea level.

N2  - Seventeen species of the cockroaches were recorded from three islands of the Ryukyus, namely, Okinawa, Ishigaki and Iriomote. These were all taken during my survey in May 1983. The female of Symploce yayeyamana Asahina (1979) was first described herein as taken from Iriomote Island. A brief description of the Allotype female is as follows; Body ca. 17mm, hindwing length 15mm. Body shining chestnut brown; the large prothoracic marking is deep brown, narrowly striped in the center as is the case in the male insect. Abdomen broad, supraanal plate broadly triangular, the apex rounded (Fig. 1). Subanal plate very broad covering whole abdominal end beyond the supraanal plate. A female and a larval specimens of Trichoblatta nigra (Shiraki) were recorded for the first time from Japanese faunal limits. Those were taken by Mr. S. Hori on Mt. Omoto, Ishigaki Island, and preserved in the collection of Mr. F. Kawamura, Ryukyu University.

N2  - Intake, migration and development of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae in Simulium haematopotum in Guatemala were experimentally studied, as compared with those in S. ochraceum. When wild females of blackflies fed on the three regions of a volunteer's back (A, B and C), each harboring 133,90 and 12 microfilariae per one skin snip, average intakes by S. haematopotum were 92 (A), 86 (B) and 59 (C), respectively. However, as seen in S. ochraceum, most microfilariae ingested were injured and/or killed, presumably by the buccopharyngeal armature. At a constant temperature of 22℃, infective larvae were found for the first time in females of both species, dying between the eighth and ninth days after ingestion of microfilariae. Simulium haematopotum was not adversely affected by ingesting of microfilariae, and survival rates beyond eight days (45.5-56.4%) were nearly as high as those in S. ochraceum. However, larval development was asynchronous in this species, unlike in S. ochraceum. Thus, the proportion of female S. haematopotum harboring third-stage larvae among survivors through eight days was 80.0% (A), 21.4% (B) and 10.2% (C), being somewhat lower than corresponding rates for S. ochraceum. Overall, it was concluded that S. haematopotum is a less efficient potential vector of O. volvulus than S. ochraceum.

N2  - Seasonal occurrences of the pyroglyphid mites in house dusts were observed during period from October, 1981,to September, 1982 in Saitama prefecture. Six houses were selected for this survey. Of these, 3 houses had asthmatic children in their families. Surveys on the seasonal fluctuation of mite population in house dust was carried out in Saitama prefecture. Eighty four samples from 26 houses were examined in 4 seasons, 1981-82. Distinct seasonal changes were observed in number of pyroglyphids in all the houses surveyed. The highest density of mites in the house dust was shown from July to September in 1982. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was the most abundant species from August to September, while D. farinae was more prevalent than D. pteronyssinus in July and August. Average numbers of mites per 0.5 gram fine house dust were 152.3 in winter (26 samples), 254.0 in spring (20), 663.0 in summer (19), and 333.1 in autumn (19). Pyroglyphid mites were dominant in number in each season. Mites belonging to Acaridae, Analgesidae, Trombidiformes and Mesostigmata increased in number in summer. On the other hand, Glycyphagus spp. increased in winter, Chortoglyphus sp. of Glycyphagidae in autumn, and oribatid mites in spring. Among the pyroglyphid mites obtained, D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae and Hirstia domicola showed the largest numbers in summer, however, Malayoglyphus intermedius reached a peak in number in autumn and Euroglyphus maynei showed no remarkable seasonal fluctuation. Statistical analysis was done for number of pyroglyphid mites collected from 18 houses in four seasons by Wilcoxon's method. Statistically significant differences were shown in number of pyroglyphid mites in the house dust as follows : Sum.>Win., Sum.>Spr., Sum.>Aut., Aut.>Win. and Spr.>Win. except to Spr. vs. Aut .(p<0.01).

N2  - In order to obtain basic information on the adsorption of insecticides to soil on streambed, laboratory tests were conducted by bioassay, using columns packed with sands through which insecticide dilution was passed. Very high adsorption to sands, particularly to fine sands, was observed in temephos, when water was passed slowly. The adsorption was generally intermediate in chlorpyrifos-methyl, and slight in fenitrothion. Difference in adsorption between suspension prepared from wdp and emulsion from EC was slight, if any. Release of insecticides once adsorbed to sands was negligible in temephos, intermediate in chlorpyrifos-methyl, and remarkable in fenitrothion. The most plausible reasons for extremely short carry of temephos in Guatemalan minute streamlets, where S. ochraceum larvae breed, were considered as (1) its marked adsorption to static soil on streambed followed by negligible release into water, and (2) lack of particulates or silt in streams, which, if existed, could assist carry of the toxicant to further distance downstream.

They all belong to the genus Simulium Latreille s.l. and are placed in the subgenera Eusimulium Roubaud (three species), Gomphostilbia Enderlein (three species), Himalayum Lewis (one species) and Simulium Latreille s.str. (12 species). Among the known species, S. nigrogilvum is resurrected, being distinguished from S. indicum, and the previous distribution record of the Malayan species, S. hackeri, from Thailand is recognized as an error due to misidentification. Descriptions for all new species and redescription for S. nigrogilvum are presented. Keys to species are given for all known stages, and the taxonomic affinities with related species within a species-group are discussed for each species.

N2  - Light-trap studies on the seasonal prevalence of Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles were conducted during the period from 1963 to 1972 in specified study sites of the Fukuoka area. The results of the studies are subject to the inquiries into the relations with the natural infection patterns of the mosquito with Japanese encephalitis virus and the epidemic sizes of Japanese encephalitis. The vector populations had been infected in their increasing phases in the severe epidemic period before 1967 but often in their decreasing phases in the mild epidemic period after 1966. The period changes in mode of vector infection and epidemic size might be attributed to a chronic tendency towards decline of vector populations. Despite of the above facts, the annual variation in the onset time of vector infection was responsible for year-to-year fluctuation in epidemic size in the mild epidemic period as well as in the severe epidemic period.

N2  - Experiments were carried out to determine in what larval stage malnutrition affects ovary development of Culex pipiens molestus and autogenous strain of Aedes togoi. Malnutrition effects were evaluated by dissecting the females on the 5th day after emergence, counting total number of ovarioles, and observing degree of follicular development as well as measuring wing length. 1) Four groups of larvae were reared under poor nutrition during each one larval stage. In both species almost only in the 4th stage larvae the malnutrition affected the ovary development. 2) The 4th stage larvae were reared under such condition during earlier or latter period of the stage. In Culex pipiens molestus, the malnutrition in both the earlier and the latter period of the 4th larval stage caused the decrease of total number of ovarioles and eggs. Though the effect in the latter period of the stage was stronger than in the earlier period, the autogeny rate of the mosquito was more than 80%. In Aedes togoi, the malnutrition in the earlier period of the 4th larval stage had almost no effect on the development of ovaries and body size. On the other hand the malnutrition in the latter period of the stage not only reduced the total number of ovarioles but also made the adult mosquito difficult to produce autogenous eggs.

N2  - During the last 10 years, a survey of the axil-breeding mosquito has been carried out at several places of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka, to learn more about their distribution. A total of 27 species of mosquitoes was collected from axils of banana, abaca, taro and pandanus. Among the species collected, the larvae of 12 species were found almost exclusively in the leaf axils. Aedes poicilius, the incriminated vector of bancroftian filariasis, was found to breed extensively in the axils of abaca and banana in the Philippines, especially at Bicol Peninsula. This species, however, seems to prefer axils of other plants to axils of banana and abaca at outside of the Philippines. Ae. ananae and Ae. flavipennis were next common in abaca and banana axils in the philippines. Malaya genurostris was predominant, and sometime the only, species found breeding in taro axils wherever the areas examined. In addition to those, the axils of banana and taro also support the larval stage of medical important mosquitoes, such as Ae. kochi and Ae. albopictus.

N2  - The effects of ultraviolet rays on the oothecal formation were studied on the two species, Peri-planeta americana and P. australasiae. The females at different stages of the oothecal formation were exposed under UV rays mostly composed of 253.7nm in W.L., using a germicidal lamp (100μW・(cm)^<-2>・(sec)^<-1>) for 10min. Irradiation was performed on the whole body or head or thoracoabdominal segments. The resorbation of the genital pouches or deposition of abnormal oothecae of various types were observed frequently by the UV irradiation as shown in Fig. 2. In the first group of females irradiated on the whole body, those that received the irradiation at the early stage in the oothecal formation (the 1st stage as shown in Fig. 1) deposited abnormal oothecae at the high rate as shown in Table 1,suggesting that the most sensitive stage to UV rays was the Ist stage in the oothecal formation. In the second group of females irradiated on the head, abnormal oothecae were also formed at the high rate. However, the third group irradiated on the thoracoabdominal segments proved to deposit normal oothecae as shown in Table 2. These results demonstrate that the receptive site for UV ray stimuli is on the head. This inhibitory effect of UV rays was also observed in four other domestic species, P. fuliginosa, P. japonica, P. brunnea and Blatella germanica. However, in two semi-domestic species, Parcoblatta kyotensis and Nauphoeta cinerea, the inhibitory effect was not observed when irradiated with the same dose of UV rays as shown in Table 3. A possible mechanism of the inhibitory effect of UV rays on the oothecal formation was discussed, including dysfunction of the neuroendocrine systems.

N2  - Three cases of human myiasis due to two species of Cordylobia were reported. In case 1,the patient was a 35 year old Japanese woman who had been in West Cameroun in 1979. A mass attended with a severe pain was found in the right upper-eyelid. Two maggots taken out from the lesion were identified as the third-stage lervae of Cordylobia rodhaini Gedoelst, 1909. In cases 2 and 3,the patients were the siblings, a Japanese boy aged 6 and a Japanese girl aged 2,who had been in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire in August 1982. The masses attended with a severe pain were found in the fore-head and shoulder of the boy and in the back of the head of the girl. Six maggots were taken out from the lesions and they were identified as the third-stage larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga (Blanchard, 1893).

N2  - The immature stages of six species belonging to the genus Gymnodia R.-D., namely G. ezensis Shinonaga et Kano, G. tohokuensis Shinonaga et Kano, G. humilis (Zetterstedt), G. lasiopa Emden, G. ascendens (Stein), G. nigrogrisea Karl, were described and illustrated. A key to the third instar larvae of the six species was presented. The eggs of ezensis and tohokuensis were the "basic" phaoniine-type and those of ascendens and nigrogrisea were the "modified" phaoniine-type in morphological characters. All the species described in this paper were proven to hatch from eggs in second instar, and third instar larvae were obligately carnivorous. The shape and color of posterior spiracles of third instar larvae were most characteristic and useful features for the identification of Gymnodia-larvae from Japan. The shape and features of puparia and pupal respiratory horns were also characteristic in some species. The taxonomic and biological significance of some morphological features was discussed.

N2  - Twenty kinds of 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl) cyclopropane-carboxylic acid esters of acyclic alcohols were synthesized, and their insecticidal activities against houseflies were investigated by three bioassay methods; a topical application, a filter paper contact and a volatile effect test method. Among the α-ethynyl alcohol esters, (E)-1-ethynyl-2-methyl-2-pentenyl ester possessed the highest activity by a volatile effect test method. The insecticidal activities of α-cyano alcohol esters were lower than those of corresponding α-ethynyl esters. The insecticidal activities of the other types of esters were low. From these results, α-ethynyl-2-methyl-2-pentenol was selected as an alcoholic moiety, and the insecticidal activities of 4 kinds of esters containing different acidic moieties were investigated. Among these esters, chrysanthemate showed the highest efficacy by the volatile effect test method. This compound was selected as a unique pyrethroid possessing high volatile effect, and is now promised to be developed.

N2  - Comparative efficacy of seven insecticides against Guatemalan blackfly larvae was assessed by semi-field trough tests. Chlorphoxim, permethrin and chlorpyrifos-methyl consisted of the most effective group, followed by the second group, temephos. The third group, diazinon, phenothrin and fenitrothion, was inferior to the above two groups. Unlike most organophosphorus insecticides, pyrethroids have a tendency of sharp mortality dropping in relation to the concentration decrease. Blackfly larvae paralyzed by phenothrin showed high recovery. No difference in susceptibility was observed, either of four blackfly species, Simulium ochraceum, S. metallicum, S. callidum and S. horacioi, or of small-, medium- and large-sized larvae of these species. With the same total amount of temephos application, no great difference was observed in mortality, as far as exposure time was in the range of 10 to 120min; but higher mortality was observed with 300min exposure. All available data of temephos by trough and stream tests were reviewed on the basis of concentration per 1min water discharge (ppm-min). Minimum value for the 95% lethal concentration in trough tests was estimated to be 3ppm-min. Most stream tests under review were found effective only when more than 3ppm-min was applied. Exceptions for the above were considered as due either to special particulate formulation or to adsorption of temephos onto particulates suspended in stream water.

N2  - Atylotus takaraensis n. sp. is described based on the male and female materials from Tokara Islands, Japan. This species is closely related to Atylotus kakeromaensis Hayakawa, Takahasi and Suzuki, 1982,but can be easily distinguished from it by the much shorter or lacking appendix on vein R_4 of wings in addition to the absence of any markings on abdomen. Key to the 11 Japanese species belonging to the genus Atylotus is presented.

N2  - A new species, Myospila japonica, is described and illustrated. This species is closely related to M. laevis (Stein), but differs from it in having 1 or 2 small hairs around notopleural bristle and an incision on apical part of male cerci, and no lateral bristles on scutellum of female. A revised key to the Japanese species of Myospila is presented.

N2  - Despite the reports that northern part of Taiwan is the known northernmost limit of distribution range of Culex vishnui, it was more abundant than Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in northern Taiwan. Furthermore, the average temperature in every month of the year in Taipei, Taiwan is nearly equal with that in Naha, Okinawa island. Taiwan strain of Cx. vishnui and Taiwan and Okinawa strains of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were compared as to some ecological characters under the laboratory conditions. In oviposition preference no clear discrimination was made by Cx. vishnui between tap water and artificial food suspension. The gravid females of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were reluctant to choose the food suspension when the amount of food in 200ml tap water was over 0.01g in Taiwan strain and 0.1g in Okinawa strain. This difference in oviposition preference may be in some way related to the difference in population level between both species. Duration of larval growth was longer in Cx. vishnui than in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus at temperatures between 20 and 33℃. At 20℃ pupation rate tended to be lower in Cx. vishnui than in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. It seemed that Cx. vishnui is less adaptable to low temperatures than Cx. tritaeniorhynchus.

N2  - Surveys of the chironomid midges breeding in sewage ditches, eutrophicated ponds, and some clean fountains or mountain streams were carried out during the period from December 1981 to February 1982 on the three main islands of the Ryukyu Archipelago, southern Japan, where no information on the freshwater chironomids was available. Adult midges were collected with insect nets on the bank of their breeding places. Bottom sediments containing larval chironomids were collected from the ponds and streams, and the adults were reared in the laboratory. As the result, a total of 26 species belonging to the tribe Chironomini of the subfamily Chironominae were recovered, as in Table 2,among which 17 species were from Okinawa Island, 14 from Ishigaki Island, and 13 from Miyako and Ikema Islands. As for their distribution in relation to the quality of water, 13 species were from eutrophicated ponds such as the eel culture pools and small lakes in urban areas, 9 species were from sewage ditches (5 species were in common to the above two types), 7 species were from clean streams (none of them was in common with the polluted waters), 2 from sedimentation pools containing clean water, and 1 from sea water ditches connected with prawn culture ponds. It was thus observed that their distribution was highly correlated with the degree of pollution with sewage waters, and other chemical or physical environmental conditions. Of 26 species collected and examined, 18 were tentatively identified as species previously described from the neighbouring regions, such as the mainland of Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Korea, and the scientific names of the rest 8 species were reserved for future studies. It was noteworthy that Chironomus yoshimatsui Martin et Sublette, the species predominantly breeding in all the sewage streams in the mainland of Japan, was not found in our collections from the Ryukyu Islands, and instead, several other chironomid species were breeding in the same types of sewages.

N2  - Egg-batches of Hybomitra tarandina (Linne, 1761) were collected from marshes in Hokkaido in late July and early August in 1981-1982. The collection sites were the same as those for Hy. olsoi egg-batches. The eggs of Hy. tarandina were found on very narrow and mostly erected stems or leaves of 6 kinds of plants, mainly Carex middendorffii Fr. Schmidt and Eriophorum vaginatum L., at the average height of 33.4cm above the ground or water surface. The egg-batches were purplish black in color, and rather elongate-oval in shape with 1 to 3 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 399. Thirty-six per cent of egg-batches were destroyed by parasitic wasps.

N2  - The yellow dung fly, Scatophaga stercoraria L., was tested to ascertain how intraspecific competition among larvae acts on the subsequent development. Various numbers of newly hatched larvae were reared with a fixed amount of cow dung to assess the density effects on the pupation, pupal volume, developmental period, emergence of adults and relation between the pupal size and the fly's wing length with special reference to the male and female. On the whole, higher larval mortality, reduction of pupal volume (male reduced more remarkably than female) and shortening of developmental period were caused by high densities. But, the intensity of competition had no effect on the sex ratio of emerging flies within the observed range of densities. The ratio of the length of pupae to the width was almost settled in any sized pupae and without any significant difference between sexes. The relation between pupal size and the wing length of flies was well represented by a regression line.

N2  - A comparative study on the mouth parts of medically and veterinarily important flies was performed, and the development and origin of the prestomal teeth in cyclorrhaphous flies were discussed. The types of the mouth parts of Musca-species were divided into three groups, viz. domestica, conducens and crassirostris-groups based on the development of the prestomal sclerites. Observations using both a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a light microscope made clear the external characters and the quality of the prestomal teeth, and showed the true affinities of mouth parts. Intermediate forms were found among the three groups, and gradual development of the prestomal teeth and discal sclerite were observed. It was supposed that the prestomal sclerites of Musca-species gradually evolved from the undeveloped type to the developed, sclerotized type that have the acute labella and the pseudotracheae of a reduced number, acquiring the food-habit which is omnivorous to haematophagous. In Calypteratae, the species which have developed prestomal teeth were confined to those which are predacious or haematophagous. Basically, the muscid, calliphorid and sarcophagid flies have prestomal teeth regardless of their food habits. But in tachinids and some species of anthomyiids, the prestomal teeth were vestigial or absent. Moreover, in most of the species belonging to Aschiza and Acalypteratae, the prestomal teeth were absent, although they were found in some phorid species. Considering the phylogeny and the present state of prestomal teeth in cyclorrhaphous flies, the origin of the developed prestomal teeth found in the higher calypterate flies of medical and veterinary importance can presumably be traced back to the ancestral Anthomyiidae.

N2  - Effective distance of application of temephos wdp against blackfly larvae or insecticidal carry in streams, was studied by decrease of larval population on substrates and by bioassay of water and soil in minute streamlets in and near an onchocerciasis endemic area in Guatemala. An application of temephos with the dose of 2ppm (AI) for 10min water discharge was effective up to 100m downstream in a streamlet of 0.8 liters/sec discharge, but only 25m in a smaller streamlet of 0.13 liters/sec discharge. In a similar small streamlet of 0.07 liters/sec discharge, the carry was the same 25m, even when an extraordinarily high dose of 200ppm was applied. It was found that, as far as temephos is concerned, the effective distance should depend on the amount of water discharge, resulting in an extremely short carry in streamlets with minimum water discharge, and that in minute streamlets of 0.07-0.13 liters/sec discharge, the carry could not be extended by increasing insecticidal dose. The probable reasons for such short carry in minute streamlets were discussed.

N2  - The susceptibilities of several species of mosquitoes to Chikungunya virus were tested. The mosquitoes tested were Aedes aegypti, Ae. riversi, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. pipiens molestus, two strains of Cx. fatigans and six strains of Ae. albopictus. The virus was detected in four strains of Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti and Ae. riversi inoculated orally. While two strains of Ae. albopictus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. p. molestus and Cx. fatigans were not infected with the virus. The virus titer decreased shortly after oral administration in Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, but did not decrease when it was inoculated intrathoracically. The maximum titers of the virus in Hyogo and New Guinea strains of Ae. albopictus were 1.6×(10)^4 PFU/mosq. and 8.4×(10)^4 PFU/mosq., respectively. In Ae. aegypti, the maximum titer of the virus was 2.0×(10)^4 PFU/mosq. Two strains of Chikungunya virus were used in the present experiment and they showed a significant difference in the multiplication in mosquitoes.

N2  - By individual cross of housefly males collected from the dumping ground on the "Third Yumenoshima" area to females of a standard strain (Lab em-7-em) immediately after emergence, it was shown that males with M (male determining) factor in autosomes both in homozygous and in heterozygous states are included in the housefly population of the area. This confirms a recent view that the houseflies with anomalous sex determination (A^MA-type or A^MA^M-type) became remarkable in various locations of Japan, in place of the standard houseflies in which the sex determination is XY^M-type. It was also revealed that the development of follicles in the ovary was greatly delayed in many females of the strain of the housefly originated from the "Third Yumenoshima" area.

N2  - To improve the group rearing techniques of Toxorhynchites splendens larvae, the efficiency of non-living and living diets were examined. 1. Both of the 1st and 2nd instar reared individually with either dried yeast powder (DYP) or powdered mouse food (PMF) developed to the next stage, and the developing duration from 1st to 3rd instar was 2 days shorter with DYP than PMF. 2. Fifty larvae in each larval stage were reared without food for a fixed period of hours, and the average number of survivors among the 1st instar preying for 48hr were 9.7 (19.3%), that of 2nd instar for 72hr were 4.0 (8.0%), that of 3rd instar for 96hr were 17.0 (34.0%), and 24.0 (48.0%) of the 4th instar survived after preying for 168hr. Those results indicated the difference in the degree of cannibalistic behaviour in respective larval stages. 3. The average survival rate in the 1st instar reared as a group with DYP was 28.0%. It was higher than that of 19.3% obtained by group rearing without food, and that of 2nd instar reared as a group with a mixture of small blood worms (Oligochaeta, smaller than 5.0mm in body length) and PMF was 44.6%. It was about 5 times as high a rate of those reared without food. 4. Almost all larvae in the 3rd and 4th instars reared as a group with enough live blood worms could develop to the next larval stage and pupated without revealing cannibalistic behaviour during the experiments.

N2  - Variations in the concentrations of Na and Cl in haemolymph of the 4th-instar larvae of Aedes togoi (At) transferred into 150% artificial sea water (Barnes's process) at various temperatures. The At had been reared using fresh water at 23℃ over 170 generations. To measure Na and Cl radioactivation analysis was done. The concentrations of Na and Cl increased for about 10hr and the thorax of the larvae became flat and wrinkled with loss of water. In the experiments at 23℃ (Fig. 4) and 28℃ (Fig. 5) the concentrations of Na and Cl decreased and the breast swelled with water. In these cases, the larvae could live till pupation. At 4℃ (Fig. 1) and 10℃ (Fig. 2) these decreases were not observed and the larvae could not mature. The concentration of Cl increased and decreased more rapidly than that of Na, and the Na/Cl ratio was not kept constant. The variations in salt concentration are caused by transportation of both ions and water. To organize a system of ionic regulation for concentrated saline solutions, At larvae reared in fresh water need about 10hr or more and a suitable temperature, above 17℃.

In total 5,1,2,4,and 2 species were collected at Okinawa, Miyako, Ishigaki, Iriomote and Yonaguni Islands, respectively. Hirosia kotoshoensis and Hi. masamitsui were mainly breeding in wet mosses, while Atylotus angusticornis was breeding in tidelands. Tabanus taiwanus and Chrysops vanderwulpi inhabited mainly in illdrained paddy fields. Injuries on a farmer's legs caused by the bite of tabanid larvae (mostly T. taiwanus) was observed.

N2  - In July and October, 1980,larval collections were carried out to clarify mosquito fauna and their habitats around the human dwellings at Ishigakijima and Iriomotejima. The results are summarized as follows : 1. In total, the following 15 species of 5 genera were collected : Anopheles sinensis, Tp. b. yaeyamensis, Ae. a. okinawanus, Ae. watasei, Ae. albopictus, Ae. f. miyarai, Ae. riversi, Ar. subalbatus, Cx. halifaxii, Cx. fuscanus, Cx. okinawae, Cx. bicornatus, Cx. ryukyensis, Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Among them, Ae. albopictus was most dominant, making up 73 to 74% of the total catch in both islands. Ae. aegypti which was recorded frequently before in these islands, was not found in the present survey. 2. The predominant breeding sites of the mosquito were tin cans (31-32% of total sites), small earthen jars (23-24%), plastic containers and tires.

N2  - A survey was carried out to clarify the mosquito fauna of Yonagunijima located between Iriomote-jima and Taiwan. The mosquitoes were collected five times trom June 1977 through August 1981. In total, 26 species of 9 genera were recorded in the present survey. Among them, following 15 species were recorded for the first time from Yonagunijima : Mimomyia elegans, Mansonia uniformis, Uranotaenia ohamai, Uranotaenia annandalei, Aedes baisasi, Aedes vexans nipponii, Aedes lineatopennis, Culex nigropunctatus, Culex infantulus, Culex bicornutus, Culex pallidothorax, Culex ryukyensis, Culex bitaeniorhynchus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, and Culex vagans. Tripteroides bambusa yaeyamensis, Aedes riversi, Culex bicornutus and Culex in-fantulus were predominant species and Aedes riversi was the most voracious biter in the forest area. Aedes vexans nipponii, Anopheles sinensis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus were commonly found in paddy fields and swamps, and Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus were predominant in artificial containers and the most voracious biter around dwelling area. The important vector mosquitoes, Anopheles minimus and Aedes aegypti which were recorded before in this island, were not found in the present survey.

N2  - The morphology of the sphaerocerid fly, Leptocera fuscipennis (Haliday) which frequented human dwellings around Haneda Tokyo International Airport was redescribed for the first time in Japan. The adult fly is halophilous, blackish brown in color and 1.5-2.0mm in length. Adults are frequently attracted to light in the evening. The larva breeds in moist layer of sludge under dry surface. The mature larva is of a whitish maggot and measures 4mm in length. The pupation occurred on dry material. The pupa is brown in color and 3mm in length. It takes 12-15 days to complete its immature life.

N2  - A nuisance sphaerocerid fly, Leptocera fuscipennis (Haliday), breeding in the Sewage Disposal Site in Tokyo Bay was studied. From May to November, 1978,surveys were carried out in the migrated area by using a blacklight trap. The result showed that the migration occurred from the end of June to the middle of July. The largest numbers of the flies were captured in the middle of July. When the flies in a light trap per night increased to more than 1,000,dwellers often grumbled. The Sewage Disposal Site began to be filled with sea mud and sludge, which were precedently mixed with sea water, in 1972. In 1975,the muddy sludge appeared above sea water in the bay, and finally the almost whole area became a kind of swamp. This condition of sludge was very good medium for this fly to breed. The ephydrid fly, Ephydra japonica Miyagi, also inhabited water of the swamp, but did not actually migrate from the site. When L. fuscipennis became over-populated at the beginning of July, they seem to migrate under a certain condition of weather. A large number of flies were captured in the evening when north to east winds blew. Winds from this direction are annually observed at the end of rainy season. Very bright illumination standing in and around the air port also seems to have directed flies to the affected dwellings.

N2  - This paper describes the food habit and seasonal population changes of Rattus rattus in sugar cane fields on Tokunoshima Island. The volume of ovule integument of the cycad Cycas revoluta, which was commonly planted around the fields, amounted to over 60% of stomach contents of the rats in November and February. The internode of sugar cane was only 12% of the contents in volume even in February when cane matured. The rat population increased in November when cane was immature, and decreased in May when the cane harvest was over. Larger rats were dominantly trapped in November and 76% of the rats weighed over 80g. Smaller or young rats were dominant in February and 61% of rats weighed 60g or less. These results suggest that rats move to the fields in autumn to eat the new ovules, and reproduce in winter under the thick cover of cane.

N2  - A colony of the larvae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus which was obtained in Toyama Prefecture by laboratory rearing of eggs deposited by wild caught females collected at a pig house surrounded by rice paddies, was shown to be highly resistant to organophosphorus insecticides. The values of LC-50 against malathion, fenitrothion, fenthion, cidial, BPMC, and p, p' DDT were 34,13.5,9.6,8.8,2.16,and 0.078ppm, respectively. It was presumed that repeated applications of organophosphorus insecticides against rice plant pests have resulted in the development of such resistances in this mosquito species, which mainly breeds in rice paddies and is known to be acting as the principal vector of Japanese encephalitis. From analysis of dosage-mortality regression lines of the larvae against malathion and fenitrothion, it was shown that the colony composed of a mixture of different populations with various susceptibility levels against the insecticides. In the study of esterase isozyme patterns of individual female adult mosquitoes reared from larvae that survived after exposure to 5ppm fenitrothion and 10ppm malathion, it was also shown that they were composed of heterologous populations with different active band patterns.

Haematopota tristis and Hybomitra olsoi were collected in Rebun Island while Ha. tristis and Tabanus nipponicus were found in Rishiri Island. The tabanid fauna of these islands seemed simple and poor. One of the main reason of it seems to be the scarcity of the cattle and wild animals.

N2  - In order to evaluate the blackfly control, the comparison was made for the efficacy of the CO_2-traps with 2kg of dry ice or with the different discharge rates of CO_2 gas (250,500,1,000,2,000ml/min). Mini-CO_2-traps with 1kg dry ice operated by battery were also tested for the collection of the blackfly, Simulium ochraceum, in the endemic area of onchocerciasis in Guatemala. The species composition of adults collected with the CO_2-traps was similar to that of larvae from the nearby breeding place. The number of blackflies collected by the CO_2-traps varied greatly with discharge rates of CO_2 gas. Seasonal trends of blackfly density obtained by the CO_2-traps at the rates of 1,000 and 2,000ml/min and dry ice were similar to each other. But the traps with less than 500ml CO_2/min didn't produce satisfactory results to demonstrate the trends. The species composition by the mini-CO_2-trap was similar to that by a human bait catch, but the number of blackflies by the former was less than one tenth of that by the latter.

N2  - Microencapsulated diazinon (MC) showed superior residual effect to emulsifiable concentrated diazinon (EC) against the German cockroaches. The observation of the body-cleaning behaviour of cockroaches, the chemical analysis of diazinon and the microscopic observation of the MC proved the easy attachment of the MC to their body surface and the massive ingestion into their digestive tracts. Thus, the MC in the guts of cockroaches plays an important part of its killing activity as the MC on the body surface does. Due to this bimodal entry, the short-contact and residual toxicities of MC are fortified over that of EC.

N2  - In the last several years, the number of tsutsugamushi disease (scrub typhus) patients began to increase throughout the mainland of Japan, not excepting Aomori Prefecture in the northern district. By analysing the data on distribution of chiggers, the outbreak of cases, and the isolation of Rickettsia in Aomori Prefecture, the author discusses the epidemiological aspects of the new type (spring and autumn type) tsutsugamushi disease, in which species other than Leptotrombidium akamushi (Brumpt) play the role of vector. Including the data from Sasa (1956) to the author (1979), 3 sub-families, 9 genera and 28 species of chiggers have been recorded in Aomori Prefecture. Of these, L. pallidum (Nagayo et al.) is one of the dominant species, and it is distributed widely and shows the peaks of occurrence both in spring and autumn in this district. After finding a suspected case reported in 1961,15 cases were found in Aomori Prefecture during the years 1971-1981. These cases were limited in spring and autumn, and some regions (Noheji, Shichinohe, Sannohe and Namioka). This led us to a new understanding of the "noxious areas" in this district. Strains of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi (Rt) were isolated from rodents trapped at the restricted locations in the Noheji and Namioka regions where patients had been infected. Especially in Namioka, where a lethal case occurred, the Rt positive rate in rodents was as high as about 57%, and one series of L. pallidum recovered from a Rt positive rodent was positive for Rt. The above observations suggest firmly that L. pallidum plays the role of vector of the new type tsutsugamushi disease in the noxious areas in Aomori Prefecture.

N2  - In the screening for insecticidal antibiotics with mosquito larvae (Culex pipiens pallens) as a test insect, the author isolated Streptosporangium albidum strain (TI-1) that produced a substance with highly insecticidal activity. From the results of the examination on cultural conditions for producing the larvicidal antibiotic in vitro, the dilutions of the culture filtrate of 1/8,000-1/10,000 to kill 50% of 1st instar larvae were considered as an extremely active titre. It might be supposed that the antibiotic has not contact insecticidal ability but stomach toxicity, because it was inactive against the mosquito pupae.

N2  - High, intermediate and low transmission efficiencies for Japanese encephalitis virus were differentiated among 7 colonized strains of Culex tritaeniorhynchus from different geographical areas when they were infected with a large dose of virus and incubated at 30℃. Two strains from Japan (Amami and Nagasaki) were highly efficient transmitters. One strain from Japan (Kyoto) and another from Taiwan were intermediate transmitters. Three strains from Pakistan were susceptible to JE virus, but their transmission efficiency was low. When mosquitoes were fed with a small virus dose and maintained at 25℃, salivary gland infection rates and transmission efficiency were low in the intermediate and the low transmitters. Susceptibility to virus infection and ability of the mosquito to transmit virus seem to be regulated by independent genetic mechanisms. The role of susceptibility of each secretory part of salivary glands on transmission efficiency of mosquitoes is discussed in connection with the geographical distribution range of JE virus in Asia.

N2  - An ecological study was carried out on distribution, movement and change in the body weight of Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett during their overwintering. Overwintering population of Cx. p. pallens was distributed aggregatively in a cave (air-raid shelter). More mosquitoes were found in the inner room of a 3-room shelter and gathered on the lower part of the wall. The degree of such aggregations changed with fluctuation in the temperature and humidity inside the room, and became maximum in January. The movement of mosquitoes was influenced by air temperature : It was least frequent in February when the temperature was lowest. The movement was least frequent on the lower part of the wall. The mobility rate (percentage of mosquitoes which changed their resting positions) was about 70% on average. Mean body-weight of mosquitoes before and after overwintering was 1.271mg and 0.708mg, the reduction rate being 44.3%.

N2  - The biological activity of methoprene (Isopropyl (2E, 4E)-11-methoxy-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,4-dode-cadienoate) and its slow-release formulation, Altosid[○!R] 10F which contains 10% methoprene, were evaluated against the chironomid midge, Chironomus yoshimatsui Martin et Sublette in both the laboratory and the field. The biological effects of Altosid[○!R] 10F on C. yoshimatsui were similar to those on mosquitoes, resulting in pupal death, failure of emergence and abnormal adults. However, it was a unique phenomenon that pupation was inhibited at higher concentrations in chironomids as compared with mosquitoes. The IC_<50> values of methoprene and Altosid[○!R] 10F to the last instar larvae of C. yoshimatsui were 0.00065ppm and 0.0025ppm, respectively. As C. yoshimatsui larvae inhabit flowing water in drains, a test with short exposure to Altosid[○!R] 10F was undertaken. The IC_<50> value under 2hr exposure to Altosid[○!R] 10F was 0.0044ppm. The field test was conducted during autumn, 1980,against natural populations of C. yoshimatsui and Chironomus sp. in a Tokushima City drain. The concentration of Altosid[○!R] 10F was 0.59ppm of active ingredient/flowing water volume in the drain during treatment time. Then, after Altosid[○!R] 10F was diluted 200-fold with water, the solution was poured into the upper course of the drain for 15min. It was effective for a long period ; neither C. yoshimatsui nor Chironomus sp. emerged for more than 30 days.

N2  - Drift of invertebrates following the applications of temephos and fenitrothion was studied in a small stream. Drifting pattern was markedly different among species and between insecticides even in the same species. A large number of Anisogammarus annandalei drifted immediately after the passage of each insecticide, but Surber samples taken three days after the applications indicated the continuous presence of this species in both cases. Although Baetis sp., Nemouridae, Epeorus sp., Perla quadrata and Simulium sp. showed a similar drifting pattern each other in both insecticides, the beginning of the drift and the peak of the drift in these species were earlier for fenitrothion than for temephos. Dolophilodes sp. drifted lastly in the case of temephos and did not drift with fenitrothion. Arctopsyche sp. and Geothelphusa dehaanii were not affected by these insecticides.

N2  - Preliminary field study on larvicide formulations for onchocerciasis vector control in Guatemala was carried out in two rivers, Lavederos and Pajal, both located in San Vicente Pacaya, Department of Escuintla, in 1978. Temephos was more effective than fenitrothion against the larvae of Simulium ochraceum at the dose of 1ppm (AI) for 10min water discharge. Using temephos, no marked difference was observed in efficacy among the three formulations, namely 50% EC, 50% WDP and 10% solid. A solid formulation of temephos was considered to be the most convenient in field operation for its easiness in transportation, usage and safety in handling. Within two weeks after application, no mature larvae and pupa appeared in controlling area. A fortnightly application interval was selected, based on this result.

N2  - The effects of six organophosphorus insecticides (Fenitrothion, Dichlorvos, Diazinon, Propetamphos, Chlorpyriphosmethyl, Fenthion), one carbamate insecticide (Propoxur), one chlorinated insecticide (γ-BHC) and one pyrethroid insecticide (Permethrin) to a colony of Blatta lateralis were investigated by the topical application method. Dichlorvos and Permethrin were most effective; Fenitrothion, Diazinon, Propetamphos and Chlorpyriphosmethyl were moderately effective, and Propoxur, Fenthion and γ-BHC were less effective. When compared with the LD-50 values per insect of other two species of cockroaches, B. lateralis was more susceptible than Periplaneta fuliginosa but less susceptible than Blattella germanica. Males were more susceptible than females in respective species. On the basis of the effectiveness of the same body weight, B. lateralis was most susceptible to all the tested insecticides. The females of B. lateralis and B. germanica were less susceptible than males, while the effects of P. fuliginosa varied with insecticides.

N2  - A nuisance chironomid midge, Polypedilum nubifer breeding in eel culture ponds was controlled successfully with temephos but recovered or alternate species appeared within 1 month. Procladius sp. was tolerable to temephos and rather increased following the treatment. The species composition of zooplankton population in the ponds changed. The decrease of crustaceans and predatory rotifers by the insecticide seemed to cause the increase in other rotifers. Phytoplankton did not show a marked change soon after the treatment but increased its standing crop approximately 1 month after. No appreciable change occurred in the water quality by the application of insecticide.

N2  - Larval crowding effects and oviposition preference of 7 strains of Culex tritaeniorhynchus from Far East were studied under laboratory condition. The 7 strains may be grouped according to the experiments into 3 types : (1) Strains Tt and O : The pupation rate at low larval density was higher than in OK-7 strain. No clear discrimination was made between tap water and the conditioned water which had contained the 1st-instar larvae for 1hr at 25℃. The gravid females were reluctant to oviposit on artificial food suspension. (2) Strain OK-7 : The pupation rate was lower in one larva per pot than in two or ten larvae per pot. The pupation rate decreased more sharply in overcrowded density. The ovipositing females showed a significant preference to the certain concentration of artificial food suspension. The females were reluctant to choose the conditioned water which had contained the 1st-instar larvae. (3) Strains A, N, Os76 and S : For the range of density favorable for their larval survival, the similar results to those obtained with strains Tt and O were obtained. However, the oviposition preference was intermediate between strains Tt and OK-7. These results indicate that C. tritaeniorhynchus is a variable species in the ecological characters. Discussion was briefly given on the divergence of oviposition preference for larval food among strains from viewpoint of productivity of larval food source in subtropical and temperate zones.

N2  - Biological observations were made on Cephalonomia gallicola (Ashmead), a bethylid wasp which is causative of sting dermatitis in houses, under laboratory conditions (70% R. H., 16L 8D at various temperatures) with host insects, mature larvae of Lasioderma sericorne Fabricius, and a discussion was devoted to the potentialities of injurious pest in the wasp. The observations on adult wasps were made at a temperature of 26℃ and the experiments on development were conducted at various temperatures within a range of 15-40℃. The results are summarized as in the following. The pre-oviposition period was 4.9 days in mated female and 25.8 days in unmated females. The ovarian eggs remained immature in teneral females. In the unmated females the number of mature eggs remaind 5-6 in their ovaries during the long preoviposition period. The width of head capsule in adult females decreased with increased number of eggs in the cases in which the number of eggs on a host was more than 5. The females reared with constant supply of fresh hosts had laid 4.4 eggs on a host at intervals of 2.1 days, and survived a long period of 94 days. The wasps reared without host supply did a shorter period of 10-20 days. The females did not lay their eggs at the temperatures below 15℃ and above 40℃. The threshold temperature for development was determined as 15.8℃ in the two sexes, and the total effective temperature for development as 240.4 day-degrees in females and 227.3 day-degrees in males. The above findings appear to make the species suited for the continued existence under some detrimental conditions and for rapid growing of house-haunting populations under some appropriate conditions, showing that the species is of synovigenic type in the regulation of ovulation and egg disposal.

N2  - Allergenicity (antigenicity) of the common domestic cockroaches in Japan, Blattella germanica (Linne), Periplaneta fuliginosa (Serville), and P. americana (Linne), was investigated by skin tests, RAST, and basophil degranulation test with crude antigens extracted from the triturated, whole cockroach bodies with physiological saline. The following results were obtained : 1. Eight out of 9 volunteers who had been working in an entomological laboratory were positive for the cockroach antigens in prick tests. 2. Five of 7 asthmatic outpatients who visited an allergy clinic were positive for the antigens in intradermal tests, and 12 of the other 34 asthmatic patients gave positive results in IgE-RASTs with the antigens. 3. Two out of the 7 positive volunteers in the prick tests were subjected to basophil degranulation tests; one of them showed positive result for the test, but the other was negative. These results confirmed the allergenicity of the common cockroaches against man, but a discrepancy between man's reactivities in the prick- and basophil degranulation tests to the antigen remained to be investigated. Allergenic difference was also suggested between cockroach- and house dust mite antigens.

N2  - It is necessary to establish a standard method in evaluating an immature simuliid density. This paper describes the results of the comparison of various artificial substrates (i. e., bricks, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets, PVC or silicone tubes) with unit time (10min) collection in the fields in Japan and Guatemala. In Tanzawa, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, PVC sheets and normal bricks were compared with unit time collection monthly. Mean numbers of immature simuliids captured by bricks, PVC sheets and unit time collection were 3.6,33.8 and 65.8,respectively (Table 1). Thus, bricks were not recommendable as the artificial substrate. The seasonal occurrence was observed by PVC sheets. Simulium japonicum were dominant (96%) and occurred throughout the year. S. suzuki and S. bidentatum occurred during May to September abundantly, while S. subcostatum January to March. Prosimulium hirtipes group was shown March to April (Table 2). In Mt. Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, PVC sheets and tubes were compared with unit time collection monthly. Total number of S. japonicum, dominant species (69%) in the tributary No. 8 of the Yamaguchi River, captured by PVC tubes, sheets and unit time collection were 1,507,875 and 669,respectively (Table 4). In 4 stations from the headwaters to the main stream, the species composition and its seasonal change were observed. S. subcostatum was abundant from the head to the middle reaches; S. japonicum was so at the middle courses where the water runs rapidly; and S. aokii was found in the lower courses of the tributary and the main stream also (Table 3). Each species showed a specific occurrence pattern (Figs. 4-7). In the River Los Lavaderos and the River Guachipilin in the pilot area for research and control project of onchocerciasis, Municipality of San Vicente Pacaya, Department of Escuintla, Guatemala, the silicone tubes were compared with unit time collection fortnightly. In the River Los Lavaderos, the number of larvae and that of species were not different widely between both methods (Table 5), while in the River Guachipilin, unit time collection varied widely according to the skill of collectors (Table 6,Fig. 8). As a conclusion, the author recommends that the use of unit time collection together with the artificial substrates (PVC sheets and/or silicone tubes according to the condition of the stream) is preferable for the evaluation of the immature simuliid density.

N2  - We found that larvae of Culex pipiens pallens and Aedes albopictus occur in pools of street drain catch-basins at a residential area of Tokyo metropolitan during the period from June to October, 1978 and 1979. The larvae were found in more than half of 145 basins examined, especially on summer season. The larvae of Cx. pipiens pallens occupied the basins during the period from June to August while the larvae of Ae. albopictus increased to wards the later half of the period.

N2  - Lethal and knockdown effects of several insecticides to the drugstore beetle, Stegobium paniceum which is one of Cephalonomia gallicola's hosts, were examined in the laboratory. Fenitrothion showed the most effectiveness among the five tested insecticides by the topical application method. On the contrary, dichlorvos was less effective to the others. In the film contact test, dichlorvos showed very quick knockdown effect in comparison with the other insecticides. Permethrin, propoxur and MTMC showed the remarkable effects in comparison with the organophosphorus insecticides except dichlorvos.

N2  - Using a scanning electron microscope and a phase-contrast light microscope, morphological observations were made on the first-and the last-instar larvae of two species, Gigantodax aquamarensis and G. wrighti, collected in Guatemala, Central America. Between the first-and the last-instar larvae, no substantial morphological change was observed. The first-instar larvae of the two species are very similar and characterized by the following features. Cephalic fans are well-developed. Anteromedian palatal brush consists of simple hairs. At the ventral base of hypostomial teeth II-IV, a hollowed space is present at each side. Mandibular teeth differentiated as seen in the later-instar larvae. Covering brush and apical brush of mandible are present. These characters of the genus Gigantodax are shared by the genus Simulium but not by the genus Prosimulium sensu Peterson, 1970. This suggests that the genus Gigantodax has closer affinities with the genus Simulium than with the genus Prosimulium sensu Peterson.

N2  - A new recessive mutant, short-antenna (sa), was isolated from a colony of the mosquito Aedes (Finlaya) togoi. The apical segment of an antenna is lost in this mutant, whose antenna therefore consists of 12 segments : this allele showed complete penetrance with uniform expression and was very closely linked to y (yellow-larva) in linkage group 3 with a recombination distance of 3.0±0.4% in males and 3.1±0.3% in females. The sa allele is not allelic to the ca (cut antenna) which expresses loss of 4 to 7 antennal segments.

Mosquitoes Armigeres subalbatus used in this study had been maintained in the laboratory for 160 generations after being collected in Kanagawa Prefecture. Normal spermatozoa had 1 flagellum and 2 mitochondria, but abnormal ones had unusual numbers of them. The counts of all normal and abnormal spermatozoa were taken from one side of the double lumen of a cross-section. Abnormal spermatozoa were detected in the probability of 4.37%, which was averaged from data on 10 seminal vesicles.

N2  - A year-long investigation was carried out to study the relative importance of the Guatemalan blackfly species in relation to the transmission of onchocerciasis at finca (plantation) Pena Blanca situated on the southeastern part of the endemic area of San Vicente Pacaya in 1977 and 1978; as well as at two other fincas Monica Ivone and San Rafael Sumatan in the major endemic zone on the Pacific slope of the Sierra Madre in 1978. The predominant anthropophilic species was Simulium ochraceum at Pena Blance and Monica Ivone, while it was S. metallicum at finca San Rafael Sumatan. Simulium ochraceum females harboured the third-stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus at Pena Blanca (0.33%) and at Monica Ivone (0.02%). By contrast, S. metallicum and S. callidum did not harbour any stage of larvae of this parasite, although first- and second-stage larvae indistinguishable from O. volvulus were found in these two species of blackflies at Pena Blanca (1.0 and 0.3%, respectively). The annual infective biting density (AIBD) of S. ochraceum at Pena Blance was 221,and its seasonal pattern was distinct, exhibiting high peak period during the dry season. The AIBD of the same species at Monica Ivone was 59. Simulium ochraceum was proved to be not only anthropophilic but also zoophilic when the goat was compared with man as an attractant. In conclusion, it is recommended that any control measures against the vector insect in the southeastern part of the Guatemalan endemic zones should be concentrated on S. ochraceum.

N2  - The laboratory tests of the microencapsulated formulation of diazinon (KNOX OUT[○!R] 2FM, diazinon microcapsule) were undertaken against the German cockroach to evaluate the residual efficacy. The diazinon EC and the fenitrothion EC which have been in a practical use as the cockroach insecticides were employed as the reference. The diazinon microcapsule has been proved to be a very promising insecticide against the cockroach when the residual treatment was applied. 1. In the petri dish test, the diazinon microcapsule on plywood panels at 250 and 1,000mg of the active ingredient per m^2 showed 100% mortality of the cockroach at even 12 weeks after the treatment in 24-hr continuous contact. On the other hand, fenitrothion sprayed with 2% solution on the plywood panel showed the efficacy for only 3 weeks. 2. In the 45×45cm enclose test, the diazinon microcapsule showed more quick knock-down effect than the diazinon EC or the fenitrothion EC. The diazinon microcapsule also killed 100% cockroaches which were released 6 times repeatedly during 28 days after thetreatment. On the other hand, diazinon EC showed only 80% mortality of the cockroaches releaesd 14 days after the treatment, and the fenitrothion EC showed even less efficacy than the diazinon EC.

N2  - Investigations on pathogens and parasites in larval blackflies from Oita in Japan were made from June 1980 to December 1981. Three mermithids (Mesomermis sp., Isomermis sp. and Gastromermis sp.) nine microsporidans (Thelohania bracteata, T. varians, T. fibrata, T. sp., Pleistophora multispora, P. simulii, P. debaisieuxi, P. sp. and Caudospora sp.) and a fungus (Coelomycidium sp.) were found. Mermithids infected five species of Simulium, whereas microsporidans and Coelomycidium sp. parasitized eight and seven species of Simulium, respectively. Altogether, 36 of 54 streams where blackfly larvae were collected were infested by one or more categories of the pathogens. Overall infection rates were all at low level-out of 29,084 blackfly larvae examined 1.35,1.24 and 1.15% were parasitized by microsporidan, fungal and mermithid parasites, respectively.

N2  - An experiment was carried out to isolate each stage of house dust mites [Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes, 1961,and D. pteronyssinus (Trouessart, 1897)] from mass culture with sieves of different mesh sizes, and further, to separate eggs from culture medium with a saccharose sedimentation technique. The fluctuation in number and age composition of a cultured population originated from approximately 1,000 eggs, which were obtained with the present method, was traced for 6 months. Culture medium (100g) was composed of equal amounts of dried yeast and mouse food powder. 1. The mite was separated roughly into each stage, and egg stage was purely collected by sieving. 2. More than 94% recovery was obtained at a saccharose concentration of 30% for D. farinae and 40% for D. pteronyssinus with adequate separation from culture medium. 3. The number of live mite increased up to (10)^4 mites at the 3rd month after beginning of the culture and began to decrease at the 5.5th month. On the other hand, the number of dead mites continued to increase gradually, and reached the same number to that of live mites at the 4th month and the 5th month in D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus, respectively. 4. The population size reached the peak at the 5th, 3rd, 4th and the 3.5th month for the female, male, trito-and protonymphs and for the larva, respectively, in a culture of D. farinae.

N2  - The tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis (parthenogenetic Okayama strain), was cultured for two generations using wholly the rabbits (IR) aquired resistance to the ticks by successive infestations of females. The ticks (IT) fed on IR was significantly lighter in weight at all the developmental states observed except unfed larvae than ticks (NT) fed on nonimmunized rabbits (NR). The precipitating antibody titer rose in all the IR after larval or nymphal infestations. The resistance of rabbits to female H. longicornis appeared equally to the immature stages of this tick, and the immuno-diffusional antigens were found to be common with larva, nymph and adult. No significant differences were observed between the weight and size of egg and fresh larva of IT and NT. This showed that some biological characters of the egg and larva were keeping more rigid innate characteristics not affected by immunological state of hosts comparing to the subsequent developmental stages. The IT females engorged on NR were significantly lighter than NT females engorged on NR, which evidence might be interpreted as the long term effects of IR on ticks. Although the total amount of excreta discharged by IT female was less than 10% of that by NT female, no significant differences were observed between content of nitrogen or iron in excreta of IT and NT. This evidence suggested that the activity of digestion and absorption in IT might be normal.

N2  - The age-composition of natural populations of Culex tritaeniorhynchus was investigated in a rural district of Osaka Prefecture during the period from 1968 to 1973,and it was found that the seasonal fluctuations in the age-composition of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus populations were well correlated to the variation of mosquito abundance. The average parous rate of the populations was slightly higher in August (18.1%) than in July (15.4%). The daily survival rate of the female mosquitoes were thus estimated as 0.525 in July and as 0.555 in August, respectively. There was little difference in the daily survival rates among different years.

N2  - In this study we investigated the antifungal effect of gaseous citral on various fungi by "the modified gas method". The 22 species of fungi were used in this experiment (Table 1). Many of them are often observed in these stored products and some of them are pathogenic to men and animals. The concentrations of citral hexane solution were 1,5,10 and 20mg/ml and 0.05ml of them was impregnated in a paper disc. The cultures were incubated at 28℃ and the radial growth was measured every 24hr for 4 or 5 days. The growth inhibitory rate of citral to various fungi was calculated from the square measure of the colony after 72hr of incubation and was shown in Fig. 2. In Trichoderma sp. the inhibitory activity of citral at each concentration was observed after 48hr incubation, but after 72hr only 20mg/ml of citral hexane solution inhibited the radial growth of fungi compared with that of control. And in Rhizopus nigricans, which grew most rapidly in the 22 species of fungi, the antifungal effect of citral was observed after 24hr incubation, but it could not be observed at all after 48hr. Because the mycelium of that fungi expanded too quickly and covered all the medium even with 20mg/ml of citral. Though the antifungal activity of citral is different by the species of the fungi, it is obvious that the gaseous citral has antifungal effect on all the 22 different species of fungi investigated. So it is supposed that, in the environment of the grain mites, citral released by the mite inhibits the growth of fungi and is indispensable to the survival of mites.

N2  - Some experiments were made to evaluate the potential of house centipede, Thereuonema hilgendorfi Verhoeff, as a predator of mosquitoes. The number of footprints of the house centipede on smoked papers showed that the animal moved around actively during the nighttime, especially in the first half of the night. An exponential equation, n=N[1-exp(-a・t)], fitted well the relation between the number of mosquitoes attacked and killed by the house centipede (n) and the time in day (t). In this equation, the number of preys (mosquitoes) attacked (n) depends on 2 parameters, i.e., the initial number of the preys (N) and the attack rate of the predator (a). The number of mosquitoes attacked was compared among different densities of the predator and the prey. As a result, it was concluded that more mosquitoes were attacked at higher densities of either predator or prey, and that the house centipede attacked 0.3 to 1.3 mosquitoes per day under the average temperature of 17.5 to 25.0℃. Most of the house centipedes sampled from a cave in November were found to have eaten an average of 2.0 mosquitoes.

N2  - Feasibility for mosquito control of the metepa-treated sound trap was investigated with three species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex pipiens molestus. When the mosquitos were exposed to the sterilant-treated sound traps generated by a radio cassette recorder with endless tapes, the egg hatchability was varied by the frequency- and intensity-modulated sounds. A treated 466-Hz sound trap in 98dB SPL at the speaker was most effective to Ae. aegypti, giving the lowest egg hatchability, and a 370-Hz sound trap in 124dB was so to Cx. p. molestus. It was postulated that a treated 466-Hz, 124-dB sound trap could sterilize Ae. aegypti population within a 100-m radius area of the field, provided that no additional attenuation occurs by ground and vegetation. The egg hatchability was inversely proportional to the treated dosages of metepa, from 0% hatchability at 660μg/(cm)^2 to 9.7% at 20μg/(cm)^2 in Ae. aegypti. Advantages of the sterilant-treated sound trap over the mass male trapping were apparent in the lower percentage of egg hatchability and the vigor mating activity of the male mosquitos, possibly due to their regulated and timely uptake of the sterilant.

N2  - The distribution patterns of larvae of Anopheles sinensis and Culex orientalis were studied in a paddy field in Toyama Prefecture. The numbers of mosquito larvae were counted, by 6 different experimenters, from 12 sections (6 peripheral and 6 inner) in the paddy field, scooping 10 times each in every section. The analysis of variance revealed that, within any one section, little difference was observed in larval counts between the 2 species as well as among different experimenters. The average number of larvae of both species was smaller in 3 peripheral sections where water was flowing, in comparison to the other 3 peripheral or 6 inner sections where water was still. Younger larvae were found more abundantly in the peripheral sections than in the inner ones, while older larvae were abundant in the latter sections.

N2  - The precipitin test using the electrosyneresis (ES method) was evaluated for the purpose of detecting the mosquito larvae (An. sinensis) from the gut of the dragonfly nymphs (Sympetrum frequens), in the course of studies for their prey-predator relationships in rice fields. Antiserum was obtained from rabbits immunized by intramuscular injections of saline extracts of An. sinensis (4th instar larvae). This antiserum showed the strong cross-reaction between An. sinensis and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, and Chironomus sp. which might be fed by the dragonfly nymphs in the census fields. The specific antiserum to An. sinensis larvae was prepared by absorbing the antiserum with the saline extracts of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Using the specific antiserum on ES method, it was experimentally confirmed that the 4th instar larva of An. sinensis in the gut of the 9th instar nymphs of Sympetrum frequens could be detected with confidence up to 33hr after feeding in all cases of trials and up to 54hr in one case. It was concluded that the ES method could be useful and appliable to the quantitative study of their prey-predator relationships.

N2  - Females of 15 species of Japanese mosquitoes were studied to determine if they were susceptible to mouse-adapted dengue-2 virus (New Guinea C strain) by oral administration of the virus mixed with rabbit blood and sucrose. The following species were tested : Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus, Ae. (Stg.) flavopictus, Ae. (Stg.) riversi, Ae. (Ochlerotatus) dorsalis, Ae. (Aedimorphus) vexans nipponii, Ae. (Finlaya) japonicus, Ae. (Fin.) togoi, Armigeres (Armigeres) subalbatus, Anopheles (Anopheles) sinensis, Culex (Culex) orientalis, Cx. (Cux.) pipiens molestus, Cx. (Cux.) pipiens pallens, Cx. (Cux.) pipiens quinquefasciatus, Cx. (Cux.) tritaeniorhynchus and Tripteroides (Tripteroides) bambusa. Several hundred mosquitoes were used for each species. They were kept at 30℃ after the infection, and were stored at -80℃ after the incubation of various time length from 0 to 30 days. The detection and titration of the virus were made by the intracranial injection of a suspension pool of 10 mosquitoes in suckling mice (ddY strain). The virus was detected at varying titers from all the mosquito species immediately after the infection, but was detected after 20 days of infection only from the four species, i. e., Ae. (Stg.) albopictus, Ae. (Stg.) flavopictus, Ae. (Stg.) riversi and Ae. (Och.) dorsalis, ranging from "trace" to≧(10)^<4.6> LD_<50> per pool. In more detailed studies with the positive mosquito species, the virus was found to multiply after an eclipse period of 7 to 10 days and to reach a peak titer after 20 to 30 days.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine methods of improving the mass rearing techniques of a non-biting mosquito Toxorhynchites amboinensis (Doleschall), which is an efficient laboratory host for dengue virus when the virus is injected intrathoracically. Experiments were directed at (1) the establishment of individual rearing techniques thus preventing larvae cannibalism; (2) the development of a suitable food for the larvae; and (3) the definition of the optimum physical conditions for larvae growth. 1. The larvae were reared individually in 3ml disposable trays containing 2ml of water or in 200ml plastic cups containing 50ml of water with Aedes albopictus (Skuse) larvae provided as food. The larval period at 27℃ was 18.1 days with a pupation rate of 89.1% in the disposable trays and 18.6 days and 94.1% in the plastic cups. In group rearing of 50 larvae in plastic trays (27×35×8cm) containing 3 liters of water, the larval period was 18.1 days and the pupation rate was 29.9%. It was shown that the individual method gives higher pupation rates and that the use of larger containers give slightly better results. 2. The larvae were reared using the following feed : Tetramine^[○!R], Vita-shrimp^[○!R], liver powder, dried water fleas, dried blood worms, and drone powder. The average larval periods were 47.7,45.5,56.0,53.7,43.7 and 52.0 days, respectively. The pupation rates were 70,70,50,80,40 and 10%, respectively. Larvae reared with a combination of a living diet of newly hatched brine shrimp Artemia salina (Linnaeus) for the young larval stage and the blood worm Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri Claparede for the third and fourth larval stages pupated after an average of 23.2 days at 25℃ with a pupation rate of 100%. These results were almost the same or slightly better than those obtained with group rearing by the conventional method providing Aedes albopictus larvae in which the larval period was 24.1 days and the pupation rate 90%. 3. The larvae were reared by providing a combined living diet at the temperature levels of 20,25,27 and 30℃. No larval growth was seen at 20℃, and the average preadult periods and pupation rates at the higher temperatures were 32.2,29.4 and 27.4 days, and 100,90 and 80%, respectively. At 30℃ the death rate of the blood worms was high enough to cause fouling of the water.

N2  - Egg-batches of Chrysops japonicus Wiedemann, 1828 were collected in a paddy field at Nishine, Iwate-ken during from late June to middle July in 1980. The eggs were laid on the stems of Scirpus triqueter L. and on the undersides of leaves of 8 other plants (Phragmites communis Trinius was most frequently laid on) at the average height of 31cm above the surface of the water. The egg-batch was greyish yellow to dark brown in color with darker tints on the upper end of each egg, and a little swollen in shape with 2 to 3 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 373.

N2  - Karny (1915) described "Ischnoptera sauteri" from Taiwan based on "1♂2♀" taken by H. Sauter. When I examined the type-specimens I found that the material is all female which fact was also noted by Peterson and Gaedike (1970). In his Blattarian catalogue Princis (1969) correctly placed sauteri in the genus Blattella and synonymized Blattella subvittata Hebard (1929) with it. On our material from Taiwan and the other South Asiatic areas I checked the 2 species carefully, and found that the 2 "species" are clearly separated as far as the male supra-anal plate and hypandrium are concerned. The other characters, such as prothoracic pattern, male 7th abdominal tergite, left phallosome and female supra-anal plate seem to be of little value for specific separation. A male specimen from South Thailand affords a rather problematical intermediate feature in the male abdominal end (Fig. 22). I am, therefore, concluding the 2 species to be 2 subspecific taxa of a single species. It is not possible, for the present, to differentiate the 2 subspecies into 2 geographical races.

N2  - The effect of the waters containing larvae of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus on the oviposition of these 2 species was studied in the laboratory. The results revealed that the numbers of eggs of both species were affected during the first 4 days of oviposition. During the first 4 days, A. aegypti were attracted to the albopictus larva water. A. aegypti laid more eggs than A. albopictus when they were attracted to the larva water of the counterpart throughout the oviposition period. A. aegypti survived better in their own larva water than in tap water and lived even better in the albopictus larva water. In contrast, A. albopictus died more than A. aegypti in the larva water of the counterpart. These findings indicate the superiority of A. aegypti to A. albopictus on the breeding potential and survival when bred together.

N2  - The antifungal effect of the following 3 groups of volatile materials on Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp. fumi.) were investigated by "the modified gas method" (Okamoto et al., 1978) : (1) hexane extract of the 5 species of the grain mites : Carpoglyphus lactis (C. lactis), Lardoglyphus konoi (L. konoi), Aleuroglyphus ovatus (A. ovatus), Tyrophagus putrescentiae (T. putrescentiae) and Dermatophagoides farinae (D. farinae), (2) four analogues of citral : geraniol, nerol, neryl formate and citronellal, (3) some volatile alkanes and alkens identified from T. putrescentiae by gas liquid chromatography (G.L.C.) (Kuwahara et al., 1976) : tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, tridecene, tetradecene and pentadecene. As the result, it was revealed that the hexane extracts of 4 species of the grain mites (20g) and T. putrescentiae (40g) inhibited the growth of Asp. fumi. Comparing the citral equivalence based on the relation between the dose of citral and the growth inhibition of fungi with the quantity of citral in each extract of the mites measured by G.L.C. (Table 1), it was supposed that the antifungal effects of hexane extracts of C. lactis and L. konoi were almost due to citral but those of D. farinae and A. ovatus might also be affected by other volatile substances. All analogues of citral were less effective than citral. The order of the inhibitory activity of them was citral > geraniol &eDot; nerol > citronellal > neryl formate (Fig. 2). Six kinds of alkanes and alkens gave no inhibitory effect on Asp. fumi. Following the sieving method of Kobayashi et al. (1979), colonies of C. lactis and L. konoi isolated from the culture medium were separated into three developmental stages, adult, nymph, and larva. The quantity of citral in each stage of mites was evaluated with G.L.C., and it was shown that as the mites grow the quantity of citral per weight of mites increased (Table 2).

N2  - In order to know the mosquito fauna and biology in the forest area in the northern part of Okinawajima, Ryukyu Islands, Japan, a mosquito survey was conducted monthly for 6 years from 1976 to 1981. Collections were made mainly at a seaside cemetery (area H), foot of a mountain (area YS and YE) and a jungle forest (area AD). Adult mosquitoes were collected by daytime human-bait catches and larvae were also collected by a dipper and pipet from their natural habitats and at artificial containers such as wooden box, earthen jar, tin can and glass vial which had been placed beforehand. In total, 31 species of 11 genera were found in the present survey. Among them Ae. japonicus was a newly recorded species in Okinawajima. Larvae of Ur. nivipleura were also newly recorded in Japan. Toxorhynchites sp. is very similar to Tx. towadensis, belonging to the Tx. manicatus group. This species was very rare but its larvae were collected from wooden boxes placed in the jungle forest. The overwintering of the species was made in the larval stage. The larvae of Cx. ryukyensis, Ae. albopictus and Ur. n. ryukyuana were commonly found in area H. Most of the females collected in this area were Ae. albopictus (95%) and a few Ar. subalbatus (4%) was also included. At the base of the mountain, the larvae of Ae. albopictus, Ae. f. downsi, Ae. riversi, Ae. a. okinawanus and Or. anopheloides were predominant. In the YS area, teh predominant females were Ae. albopictus (60%) and Ar. subalbatus (38%). In the YE area, Ae. albopictus (40%), An. saperoi (31%) and Ae. riversi (15%) were predominant and the rest were Ar. subalbatus, Ae. a. okinawanus and Ae. f. downsi in decreasing order. In the jungle forest area (AD), the predominant species breeding in the artificial containers were the same as those in areas YS and YE except Ae. albopictus which was never collected in this area. The most common species that came to bite in the area was An. saperoi (62%) and its immature stages were commonly found in streams. Considerable numbers of Ae. a. okinawanus (25%) and Ae. riversi (8%) also came to bite in this area. Engorged females and/or larvae in all instars and pupae of Ae. albopictus, Ae. riversi, An. saperoi, Ae. a. okinawanus, Ar. subalbatus, Cx. ryukyensis and Ur. n. ryukyuana were collected even in winter. Apparently blood feeding, oviposition and adult emergence of these species continued in the winter season.

N2  - During 1978 we made surveys of flies in the northern, northeastern and central parts of Thailand. This paper presents fly species as well as their densities at market places, garbage, slaughter houses and animal sheds from those parts. A total of 142,656 flies consisting of 25 species of 13 genera was collected by sweeping nets. They comprised 85.7% of Musca domestica, 9.1% of Chrysomyia megacephala, 1.4% of Phaenicia cuprina, 1.2% of Musca sorbens, 0.6% of M. lucens, 0.6% of biting flies (Stomoxys spp., Haematobia exigua and Tabanus spp.), 0.8% of haematophagous flies (Musca fasciata, M. conducens, M. ventrosa and M. crassirostris), 0.3% of Chrysomyia albiceps, 0.1% of Parasarcophaga spp. and a few other flies of less than 0.1% including Orthellia indica, Ophyra chalcogaster, Lispe orientalis, Fannia scalaris, Cosmina bicolor and Muscina stabulans. There were more females than males, the female to male ratio ranged from 552.6 : 1 to 4.2 : 1. From these surveys Musca lucens, M. fasciata, M. crassirostris, Stomoxys indica and Haematobia exigua were collected only in the north, Stomoxys uruma in the northeast, Musca conducens, Orthellia indica and Tabanus spp. in the northern and central parts, and rest of the 14 species were found to be distributed throughout all the district surveyed.

N2  - Specialized mating behaviors of Aedes (Verrallina) iriomotensis Tanaka and Mizusawa, 1973,an indigenous species of the Ryukyu Is., are described and photographed. The antennae of the male Ae. iriomotensis are only slightly more plumose than those of the female. The males do not swarm and remain for much time in the vicinity of the breeding sites and meet young females by chance through random flight. Mating excitement of the male seems to be increased rapidly when his legs touch the young virgin female, and copulation usually occurs immediately after emergence of the female on the water surface. Although we have never confirmed the presence of a sex attractant in this species, our observations suggest that a volatile female sex pheromone might play a somewhat important role in successful mating of this species.

N2  - Four species 9 strains of mosquitoes, i.e., 4 strains of Aedes aegypti, 2 strains of Aedes togoi, 2 strains of Armigeres subalbatus and 1 strain of Anopheles stephensi, were tested for susceptibility to periodic Che-ju (Korea) strain of Brugia malayi. Liverpool and Red-eye I strains of Ae. aegypti were found to be highly susceptible to the parasite, showing host efficiency of 0.21-0.34 on the average. Two strains, Black-eye and Red-eye II, were refractory. Both Rendaiji and Nagasaki strains of Ae. togoi, which have been reported as a main vector in Che-ju Island, were also susceptible. However, their host efficiency has shown a large variaiton due possibly to a large variance of the number of ingested microfilariae. Rendaiji and 406 strains of Ar. subalbatus and 1 strain of An. stephensi were determined as refractory. Larval migration rate was introduced in analysing susceptibility. It was generally higher in susceptible mosquito species or strains and lower in refractory strains. It was also suggested that high larval migration rate was not always followed by high susceptibility. As one of factors affecting susceptibility of mosquitoes, so-called chitinization of the larvae in Ar. subalbatus was discussed.

N2  - Immature stages of blackflies were studied in uppermost part of 2 streams in Guatemalan highland, Sierra Madre. In total 5 species, Gigantodax wrighti, Simulium (Simulium) tricornis, S. (S.) anduzei and S. (S.) jobbinsi in descending order of abundance, were collected. G. wrighti and S. (E.) sp. were predominant and occupied more than 80% of the total specimens collected from each stream. All the 5 species appeared at higher density in the rainy season and the first half of the dry season than in the latter half of the dry season. From the head width distribution in each month, G. wrighti and S. (E.) sp. were found to be multivoltine species. G. wrighti had two generations in the rainy season to the first half of the dry season and possibly one generation in the latter half. S. (E.) sp. had 2 generations in the rainy season, and at least one more generation, possibly two, in the dry season.

N2  - An ecological study was made on successive changes of wing-length distribution and wing length-to-R-raito relation of Culex pipiens pallens females entering and leaving an overwintering shelter. Shorter-winged mosquitoes were observed to enter the shelter in October earlier than longer-winged ones, most of which came in during late November and early December. From the change of skewness of the wing-length distribution, it was concluded that the shorter-winged mosquitoes decreased considerably during overwintering. However, the shorter-winged individuals including a few parous females were still found in a small proportion among the mosquitoes leaving the shelter. The wing length-to-R-ratio relation for the monthly catches showed that both of these values were larger in the overwintering population than in the summer one. The regression coefficient between these 2 values was larger in the overwintering population except for population captured in October, which seemed to be in a transitional phase from the summer to the overwintering populations. Discussions were given of coincidence of these findings with the conclusions so far made on overwintering aspects of Cx. p. pallens.

N2  - Seven strains collected from geographically distant places, Chantaburi (CTB), Kanchanaburi (KCH) in Thailand, Perlis (IMR), Pahang (KSU), Kota Belud (KTD), Sabah, Kuching (SWK) and Niabet (SWN), Sarawak in Malaysia were used for morphological observations, hybridization and cytogenetic observations in order to analyse phylogenetic relationships among the strains. All these 7 strains were shown to belong to the same species group with homosequencial banding patterns of salivary gland polytene chromosomes. SWK and SWN strains, sharing identical morphological characters, however, were genetically separated from the other 5 strains. The informations of phylogenetic relaitonships and the results of morphological confirmations among the 7 strains indicated that dirus is not separated from balabacensis in species level. IMR and KSU strains were most closely related to each other with strong affinities. CTB is closely related to KCH but each strain showed different degree of genetic affinities to the other strains. KTD was more diverged from CTB than from IMR strain. The relationship between IMR and KCH was more diverged than that between KTD and CTB. The results suggest that IMR and KSU strains might have experienced a recent population "bottleneck" effect.

N2  - Egg-batches of Hybomitra jersey (Takahasi, 1962) were collected in the forest of Mt. Goyo, Kitakami Range in middle July, 1978. The eggs were laid on the underside of the leaves of Sasa nipponica Makino et Shibata and Astilbe odontophilla Miq. at the average height of 38.1cm above the ground. The plants were grown at the site of rather dark and a little dry forest floor. The egg-batch was glossy blackish brown to black in color and roughly pyramidal in shape with 2 to 4 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 179.

N2  - In 1975,82 human cases of Cephalonomia gallicola stings were reported to the Nagoya City Health Centers. Since then, complaints about the wasp stings had increased year by year, and in 1978 annual cases of the complaints amounted to 295. These were reported from the residents of 149 buildings in the city. Most of the buildings were the apartment houses made of reinforced concrete, making up 77.5% of all the sites of the incidence. No statistically significant difference was found between the incidence rates of the upper and lower floors of these apartment houses. These wasp stings were encountered mainly during the warm months from May to October (97.3%); more than half of the patients were stung at night (53.1%). The parts of their bodies stung were the bare-arms and legs (51.0%), followed by the trunk (31.8%) and the neck (17.2%). Most victims suffered itching local pains soon after the sting, and in a few days, erythemas usually less than 3×3cm in size developed around the sting sites in 84.1% of the patients. Cure was attained in 3-7 days in 76.8% of them.

N2  - Larval control project of vector mosquitoes of Japanese encephalitis was carried out by Kyoto City Municipal, starting from surveys of breeding place of Culex tritaeniorhynchus in 1965. Several formulations of granule percolating effective ingredient gradually into water were prepared by some chemical companies, and were evaluated by field and laboratory tests. Granules of fenthion and EPN, which were expected to have continuous larvicidal effect, were applied for larval control by aircraft on rice fields in Kyoto City area from 1967 to 1977. Result of the field evaluation showed effective control against mosquito breeding in the rice fields during 3 to 4 weeks after the application. The factors decreasing vector mosquito population since 1969,when the aerial applications were practiced on the rice fields all over Kyoto City, are scrutinized in reference to the use of herbicides.

N2  - Taxonomy, life history, nest architecture, and nesting habits of Vespa simillima Smith are given. It is one of the most common vespines in Japan and a nuisance pest in residential and urban areas. The species consists of two subspecies, V. s. simillima Smith and V. s. xanthoptera Cameron. In Hokkaido, northern Japan, V. s. simillima colonies last for ca. 4.5 months, i. e., from late May to early October, and mature nests have mean values of 1,821 cells, 6.6 combs and 315 adults. Colony size was considerably smaller than in xanthoptera (southern subspecies), probably because of the short colonial duration in the subspecies simillima. Preferred nest sites differed between the subspecies as well as among habitats. Structural nests were very frequent in urban areas : ca. 50% of a total of 600 nests destroyed in Otaru, Hokkaido, between 1974 and 1980 were built in wall voids of buildings (subsp. simillima), and ca. 70% of 150 nests destroyed in Kyoto, southwestern Honshu in 1978 were in attics (subsp. xanthoptera). In Otaru, ca. 70% of the people injured by the hornet were stung by wasps nesting in wall voids of buildings. Control techniques are given with examples adopted by the Otaru Public Health Centre.

N2  - A Taiwanese Blattella species, rather commonly met with on the ground surface of the lowland, was treated as "Phyllodromia humbertiana Saussure" by Karny (1915) and Shiraki (1931). In recent years Princis (1950a, 1950b) found that they are entirely different from real humbertiana known from Ceylon and India. In his Catalogue (1969) Princis gave its substitute name karnyi (nom. nov.) without any description. Since the only specific diagnosis given by Karny (1915,p. 99) is very poor and inadequate I am giving here a redescription comparing it with Indian humbertiana. I believe accompanying figures will suffice diagnostic characters of both the species.

N2  - d-Tetramethrin is a compound consisting of two parts of d-cis- and eight parts of d-trans-chrysanthemate isomers of tetramethrin. A study was made to evaluate the insecticidal activity of d-tetramethrin in comparison with that of several already known pyrethroids against housefly, mosquito and cockroach under several methods of application. d-Tetramethrin showed about twice as strong killing activity as that of tetramethrin against adult housefly, mosquito and cockroach in the topical application, whereas the killing activity was similar to that of d-allethrin and natural pyrethrins. The knockdown activity of d-tetramethrin was observed to be superior to that of tetramethrin, d-allethrin and natural pyrethrins. The flushing-out activity of d-tetramethrin against cockroach was found to be the best among the tested compounds. d-Tetramethrin is therefore a synthetic pyrethroid characterized by rapid knockdown and flushing-out activities. The applicability of the compound can be widened by adding to it a synergist and/or a killing agent such as d-phenothrin.

Number of species of drifting macrobenthos increased with the sequential application of gradually increasing concentration of temephos, whereas number of drifting individuals of each species showed respective peak at certain concentration of temephos. Simulium larvae were among susceptible species together with four other species, Baetis sp., Isoperla sp., Dolophilodes sp. and Anisogammarus sp. Other approximately 20 species began to drift with 5ppm but 10ppm was necessary to flush out most individuals.

N2  - To determine the susceptibility of the wild roof rat, Rattus rattus to warfarin, a no-choice feeding test with 0.025% warfarin bait was carried out using roof rats collected from seven buildings of Tokyo in 1978 and 1979,where the rat population could not be controlled with this bait. All colonies from the buildings showed lower susceptibility than our susceptible laboratory colony. For example, 15 to 25% of the rats of two colonies survived for 90 days. It was suggested that the resistance to warfarin might have developed in some rat populations in Tokyo.

N2  - In this paper I report on infestations of the hothouse millipede Oxidus gracilis about which I was consulted. The infestations followed the pattern of urban sprawl in the suburbs of Tokyo. Infestations reported in the past 6 years (1975-1980) are shown as black circles in Fig. 1. These are located peripherally to the infestations reported in the years previous to this period (black triangles). Reports of infestations of centipedes (Scolopendra) in the Osaka suburbs showed a similar centrifugal pattern.

N2  - Warfarin and scilliroside were administered orally to the wild roof rat, Rattus rattus, captured in Tokunoshima Island where the control with rodenticides was considered to have been scarcely done. Ten days' administration of warfarin resulted in LD50 of 35mg/kg and single administration of scilliroside resulted in that of 1.2mg/kg, suggesting the susceptible level to these chemicals of this species in Japan. On the other hand, the roof rats captured at several buildings in Tokyo where it has been difficult to control the species with these chemicals, were allowed to feed 0.025% warfarin powdered bait. One of the rats captured at Shinjuku survived for more than 70 days, suggesting that resistance to this rodenticide has developed in the urban area.

N2  - Twenty-nine gynandromorphs were isolated from various strains of Aedes (Finlaya) togoi during genetic research on this species performed for 4 years. All these mosquitoes preserved in an alcohol solution were examined only externally. A high correlation existed between sex characters of copulatory organs and of abdomen, but no other regularity was observed among 5 kinds of organs examined (copulatory organ, abdomen, wing, antenna and palp). Of 29 gynandromorphs, only 5 were of the antero-posterior type and 4 were of the lateral type.

N2  - Wing-length frequency of overwintering Culex pipiens pallens from six localities of Japan was not distributed normally because of minority of shorter-winged mosquitoes. From the results of wing-length distribution analysis, the overwintering Cx. p. pallens populations in Japan were considered to be composed of two or three wing-length groups. R-ratio of the wing vein was smaller in the shorter-winged group and larger in the longer-winged group. R-ratio of the population, however, showed normal distribution and the mean R-ratios were within the range of Cx. p. pallens. Parous rate was higher in the shorter-winged mosquitoes. It was concluded from these results that the shorter-winged mosquitoes emerged earlier than the longer-winged group and joined to the majority of the overwintering group. Regressions were observed between each of wing length, R-ratio and body colour and the latitudes where the mosquito populations were sampled. Between wing length and R-ratio, linear regression was significant in each of the populations and also among the six populations; the regression coefficient was much larger among the populations than within the population.

This species is closely allied to A. angusticornis (Loew) and A. sawadai Watanabe et Takahasi in its morphological features, but can be distinguished from them by the more distinctive abdominal markings with golden hairs and by genitalia. Key to angusticornis group was proposed.

N2  - In order to clarify the life cycle of the Japanese cockroach, Periplaneta japonica (Karny), a rearing experiment was carried out under outdoor conditions in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture from April 1979 to September 1980. The results were as follows : The majority of the adults emerged bimodally from the end of April (1979) or early May (1980) to early July. The number of adults was most abundant in mid June and then decreased gradually toward the end of September. Two adults emerged in late summer barely survived until mid winter. Nineteen hundred and nineteen of oothecae were deposited from mid May to early October and the peak was observed in June. Hatching was observed from the end of June to mid September, but no hatching occurred in over-wintered oothecae. The incubation period of eggs ranged from 24.2 to 34.0 days in average, and it gradually shortened into the end of summer. The percentage of hatched oothecae was 52.5% in average and nymphs hatched per oothecae numbered 11.5 in average. All nymphs hatched in 1979 over-wintered at the 3rd to 9th instar nymphs. More than 50% of them emerged as adults during the following year. The nymphs, which had hatched in 1978 and did not emerge in 1979,over-wintered again at the nymphal stage. Of these, 80.5% emerged in 1980,and the remainder died before emerging as adults.

N2  - It was ascertained from laboratory study that the prey snails for larvae of Sepedon aenescens were 7 species out of 9 species examined, they were all non-operculate species; Austropeplea ollula, Radix auricularia japonica, Physa acuta, Hippeutis (Segnitilia) cantori, Gyraulus chinensis, Biomphalaria sp. and Bulinus sp. Oncomelania nosophora and Parafossarulus manchouricus were not attacked by larvae, because of their rigid opercula. Predation behavior of larvae was also observed in detail. There was no significant difference between velocities of development of larvae fed on Physa acuta and that of larvae fed on Hippeutis (Segnitilia) cantori. The calculated thresholds of temperatures for development were 13.5℃ in egg, 8.0℃ in larva, 11.1℃ in pupa and 10.3℃ for completing the whole immature period. The thermal constants in each developmental stage were about 36,160,78 and 268 day-degrees, respectively. Amounts of snails fed by larvae at low temperature (15℃) and high temperature (30℃) were larger than those other temperatures (19,22 and 25℃) examined, and amount of snails fed per day was maximum at 30℃. At same temperature, Hippeutis (Segnitilia) cantori seemed to be easily attacked by larvae much more than Physa acuta. Pupal weights of larvae reared at 15 and 30℃ were more lighter than others, however body length and body width of pupae did not show a special tendency. Longevities of immature stages were more lower at 15 and 30℃, and length of fore-wing (only) of adult was minimum at 30℃.

The eggs were laid on leaves, twigs and stems of 14 plants at the height of about 67.7cm above the ground. Total number of the egg-batches on the twigs and stems surpassed that on the leaves. These plants were grown at shady and wet places. The egg-batch was glossy blackish brown to black in color and roughly pyramidal in shape with 3 to 6 layers of eggs. Average number of eggs per batch was 729.

The patient was suffering from an acute conjunctivitis due to the infection of the larvae. After the larvae were removed from the eye, the symptom disappeared rapidly. The larvae were about 1.6mm long, milky white. The specimens were identified as first instar larvae of Parasarcophaga similis (Meade, 1876) judging from its morphological characters.

N2  - The localization of antigenic substances to humoral antibodies produced in rabbits, either subjected to the repeated infestations of females Haemaphysalis longicornis (parthenogenetic Okayama strain) or inoculated with extracts of various organs of the tick, were examined by the Ouchterlony double gel-diffusion test and the indirect immunofluorescent technique. The antigenic substances were demonstrated in various organs besides the salivary glands and mid-gut whose antigenicities were well established. No antigenicity, however, was observed in the cuticle and tracheae. The antigenic titer of whole tick extract was higher than that of any organs tested at the same concentration of protein. Although the tick resistance, manifested as a reduced engorged body weight, did not develop in rabbits after inoculation with extracts of various organs of tick, the precipitating antibodies having high titers were produced in them.

N2  - The fundamental frequencies of wingbeat sounds of mosquitos were inherently heterogenous and widely ranged when determined by a real-time analyzer. Acoustic extraction of the males of 4 species, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles stephensi and Culex pipiens molestus, was done from the conspecific populations in cages by generating the average mono-frequency sounds of male or female mosquitos with an audio oscillator. Small percentages of the males were left unextracted after 4 or 5 days of sounding, meanwhile 15.3% to 100% of the females were inseminated depending on the frequency and the species. The males of aedine mosquitos responded best to the conspecific male frequencies, whereas all the females of Cx. p. molestus were inseminated before the most of males were extracted from the cage. The females of Ae. albopictus and An. stephensi also responded significantly to the conspecific male frequencies. This fact may have some reference to the females' flight into the male swarm in nature. When several cohorts of Ae. aegypti or An. stephensi were introduced into a cage at intervals and the males were extracted continuously with their female frequency, the insemination rates of the females remaining in the cage varied from 10% to 20%. The flight activity of the males of Ae. aegypti and Cx. p. molestus was bimodal to peak at dawn and dusk, whereas that of An. stephensi was geared at 18 : 00 to only 15-min gate, during which their flagella of antennae were erected. No olfactory pheromone seemed to be involved in the attraction of females of these mosquitos.

N2  - The ultrastructural studies of the epithelial cells of the anal papillae of larvae of Aedes togoi were made by electron microscope. The materials were reared in different salinities for 120 generations. The epithelial cells of the anal papillae of the larvae reared in 100% sea water or fresh water have infolded and rough structures (Figs. 5-6). However, in 200% and 250% sea water, the structures become extremely fine. The structure is complicated, consisting of overlapping slices with a great number of mitochondria. The mitochondria are densely distributed, like the bubbles of a crepe cake (Figs. 1-4). In the larvae of Aedes togoi, the denser the salinities, the more complicated the structures of the epithelial cells of anal papillae. We deduce from this observation that the anal papillae of Aedes togoi serve as an organ of salt regulation system.

N2  - According to Dr. F. Zumpt, the term "myiasis" is defined as the infestation of live man and vertebrate animals with dipterous larvae. Many different species of flies produce myiasis. Many cases of myiasis have been reported from all over the world, but not so many in Japan. External myiasis is mostly otomyiasis in Japan. External myiasis except for otomyiasis reported only 4 cases up to the present. This case appears to be the 5th report of external myiasis in Japan. The patient was a 61-year-old man, living in Nagoya-city. He was admitted with the papillary adenocarcinoma on the left parotid gland. Several dipterous larvae were found in the necrotic center of the tumor. These larvae were 5 to 6mm in body length. Thirteen larvae were collected from the patient. These larvae were reared using the meat of a racoon dog with a temperature at 25℃ and at 75% relative humidity. One male and 2 female flies emerged. After a detailed examination, they have been all identified as Boettcherisca peregrina (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830). Findings on clinical case, the life cycle and species of the fly were discussed.

N2  - Inactivating effects of UV rays and ozone on cockroach aggregation pheromones were examined by bioassay. The aggregation pheromones were extracted with methyl alcohol from the feces of 4 species of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, P. fuliginosa, P. australasiae and Blattella germanica. Preference tests were carried out to compare the difference among the filter papers treated as follows : 1) untreated, as control, 2) impregnated with the pheromone extracts, 3) irradiated with short-wave UV rays after the pheromone impregnation, 4) exposed to ozone-containing air after the impregnation. As the result, it was found that the cockroach pheromones were inactivated by the short-wave UV irradiation at a dose rate of 110μW/(cm)^2・sec for 5 to 10min (dose=33,000μW/(cm)^2 or 66,000μW/(cm)^2) as well as by the exposure in ca. 0.2ppm ozone for 5min. The aggregation pheromones included in the cockroach feces were also inactivated by irradiating the short-wave UV rays for less than 1hr (dose=396,000μW/(cm)^2).

N2  - The field trial of larviciding Simulium ochraceum was carried out during the period from March to May 1979,in the Lavaderos River Valley, Municipality of San Vicente Pacaya, Department of Escuintla, Guatemala. A 10% temephos solid formulation was applied at a rate of 1 ppm for 60 in with a 14 day cycle. In the 57 sites for application, a total of 245g of solid larvicide had been applied. The larval density of the blackfly decreased rapidly in many larvicided tributaries of the River. After a few times of application the density of adult females captured with a human bait for 3 hr trended to decrease until the minimum of 6 flies in comparison with the ranging from 20 to 500 at the pre-application. The result of the present trial reveals the feasibility of the solid formulation of temephos against S. ochraceum in the field if the preapplication survey on the breeding streams of the target species are thoroughly made.

N2  - Terallethrin exhibits quick knockdown activity against sanitary insects such as mosquitoes, houseflies and cockroaches and has repellency against mosquitoes. Its killing activity is comparable to those of allethrin and natural pyrethrins. Terallethrin has remarkably high vapor pressure in comparison with those of other pyrethroid insecticides commercially available. Owing to those characteristics, terallethrin is considered to be usable in a wide range of practical applications as a knockdown agent in the household as well as public health fields.

N2  - The spray of the Asian whipscorpion, Typopeltis crucifer Pocock, 1894,was investigated chemically using a high performance liquid chromatograph and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The spray mainly consists of acetic acid, caprylic acid, and water. No other fatty acids, other volatile materials or active amines can be detected in the spray. The adult discharged ca. 5 to 15×(10)^<-5> mol of the total acid in the 1st shot. Contents of the major components were determined by massfragmentography and the following results were obtained : acetic acid, 81.7% (v/v); caprylic acid, 5.4% (v/v); water, 12.9% (v/v). These values are quite similar to those of the American species, Mastigoproctus giganteus (Lucas, 1835).

N2  - Egg-batches of Chrysops yamaguchii Shimizu et Takahasi, 1975 were collected for the first time at a shady and marshy place in the forest near Morioka-shi, Iwate-ken. The eggs were laid on the underside of the leaf of Carex shimidzensis Franch. et Saw. at the height of about 17.4cm above the surface of the water. The egg-batch was light yellowish brown with brown color on the upper end of each egg and elongated in shape with 1 layer of eggs consisting of about 241 eggs. One female was observed to lay eggs at around 2 : 00 P.M., taking 78min to complete one egg-batch of 219 eggs. Hanging posture for oviposition was taken with its head directing slightly upwards.

The surface structure of the eggs of both species was observed, and some new findings were made. The micropylar region, which was not noticed so far by light microscope, was recognized as a kind of cactus form situated at the anterior end of the egg. The markings of ventral surface, which were not elucidated clearly by light microscope, were observed in detail in both species.

Human cases of infestation of this species have been reported 11 cases so far. Recently, Fujita and Takada (1978) found that immature stages of this species infested a common small reptile, Takydromus tachydromoides. The author also collected 5 nymphs from the same species that was captured at Mt. Kora in Kurume City in 1978. This is an additional report of Ixodes nipponensis infesting a small reptile in Kyushu.

N2  - Thirty nine cases of human infestation by ixodid ticks were reported. Tick species were Ixodes ovatus (15 cases), I. persulcatus (8), I. nipponensis (4), I. monospinosus, I. acutitarsus and unidentified Ixodes species (1 each); Amblyomma testudinarium (4), Haemaphysalis longicornis (3); unidentified ixodid ticks (2). No bites by male ticks were reported whereas 2 cases were by nymphs of A. testudinarium. Biting mostly occurred during daytime field jobs in hilly areas from April to September. There seems preference of biting sites for I. ovatus and A. testudinarium, the former attacking on head and body especially on eyelids, the latter on lower extremities. Clinical manifestations by biting were generally no more than local flare and swelling of the sites, and few serious damages on the skin were observed except 4 cases, in which the sites came to suppurate. Three authentic cases of human infestation by H. longicornis were confirmed, but no viral or rickettsial infection occurred by the tick bites in all the cases.

N2  - This paper reviews information on quantitative aspects of filaria larval populations in the mosquito phase. One aim is to clarify the conditions necessary for efficient filarial transmission by mosquitoes during maintenance in the laboratory, including the requirement of suitable microfilaraemia in the host animal. Secondly, attention is given to ways of analysing the dynamics of filaria transmission in endemic areas. In general, the rate of mosquitoes becoming infected with microfilariae is proportional to the density of microfilaraemia in the host; the actual numbers of microfilariae ingested also increase in proportion to the microfilaria density. Numbers of ingested microfilariae may not be as expected from theoretical calcaulations based on two parameters : "microfilaria density in the host" and "quantity of blood ingested by mosquito." Some papers have reported mosquitoes to ingest fewer or more microfilariae than expected on the basis of these parameters. However, other studies have found that the mean number of ingested microfilariae is more or less close to what would be expected. Some possible explanations are discussed in order to account for the observed variations in the numbers of microfilariae ingested by mosquitoes. Such differences have been found between mosquito species, between strains within the same species, and between mosquitoes of different ages. Microfilaria intake is not so well correlated with the quantity of blood ingested. Defecation or discharge of blood from the anus of engorged mosquitoes may affect the number of microfilariae ingested and retained. In some species of mosquitoes oesophageal armatures may kill some of the ingested microfilariae. Density variations of microfilariae in different regions of the host skin must also be monitored carefully in relation to the feeding-sites of female mosquitoes. Several authors have shown that only limited numbers of filarial larvae develop to the third (infective) stage in each mosquito, despite the ingestion of more microfilariae by some individual female mosquitoes. Two basic factors are considered to account for the failure of some microfilariae to grow successfully. Either the infected mosquitoes may die, or else there may be mortality of the filarial larvae themselves. Under laboratory conditions, it seems that mosquito mortality is the greater influence. Additionally, some of the infective larvae may fail to be transmitted when the vector feeds again on a vertebrate host. This is due partly to third stage larvae remaining within the mosquito, and partly to failure to penetrate the host's skin by those infective larvae which escape successfully from the vector. On the basis of papers quoted here, it is suspected that in endemic areas the parasite yield is less than 10% of the total microfilariae ingested, with a few exceptions such as Brugian filariae ingested by Mansonia mosquitoes. This reduction of parasite yield is largely due to the mortality of mosquitoes during the incubation period for filarial larvae. Mosquito longevity, whether or not specimens have become infected with filariae, is therefore a most important component of vector capacity under field conditions. Transmission efficiency is expressed in terms of several indices, proposed and discussed here. For continuing epidemiological surveillance of filariasis, it is considered necessary to minimize the number of factors to be observed for measurement of transmission efficiency, in order to economize the use of man-power and technical resources for field operations.

N2  - Two mutants, hairless-antenna (ha) and white-eye (w), in Aedes togoi had been previously reported to be located on the same side of the pigmented pupa (p) locus in linkage group 2,but the gene sequence of these three alleles had not been determined by the three-point experiments. This study confirmed that the gene sequence is p-ha-w, and showed that the recombination units between p and ha range from 11.9 to 38.4 and the units between ha and ω are more than 32.4. A new mutant, extra-jointed palp (Ex) is the first dominant mutant described in Aedes togoi. The Ex allele exhibited very low penetrance of 34% and was found to be located over 32.5 map units far from the ru (ruby-eye) locus in linkage group 2. The Ex trait is sex-limited, expressed in only female palps; in the Ex female there is an additional segment extended from a normal palp. This extra segment is pointed and covered with white scales instead of black ones.

The larval development in S. ochraceum was synchronous, but that in S. metallicum was asynchronous and malformed, stunted larvae often appeared. The results suggested that the ability for S. metallicum to transmit O. volvulus would come to about 1/3.5-1/5 of that of S. ochraceum. Some information about the affinity of S. horacioi Okazawa and Onishi, 1980 for O. volvulus that closely resembles S. metallicum was given.

In young mosquitos the first three parameters were higher than for older ones; the survival rate of infected young mosquitos was less than for uninfected ones. At 14 days after ingestion, the infective rate and mature larva rate of the young mosquitos were less than for the older ones, but the total number of mature larvae dissected from young mosquitos was higher. The number of microfilariae ingested was less than the value expected from the density in the host blood. The correlation coefficient between the blood volume and microfilariae ingested was calculated as 0.5,which was not statistically significant.

N2  - Blood meal sources of field-caught engorged mosquitoes were identified by agar gel diffusion. Mosquitoes were collected in a paddy area on the outskirts of Sendai, northern Japan in 1968 and 1969. Various sampling techniques were used for collecting engorged mosquitoes; Kato's animal baited traps installed at the two pig sheds were operated at night, while a suction catcher, a drop-net cage and a sweepnet were employed in the daytime. Of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, two kinds of blood-fed samples were collected; one contained some partial feeders trapped while flying from one host to another at night, and the other consisted of fully engorged mosquitoes resting in the daytime. Blood meal sources of the former were in most cases mammals, pigs making up more than 70% of the total identified. This feeding pattern did not change between the earlier- and the later half of the night. The daytimeresting Cx. tritaeniorhynchus also fed principally on pigs and cows both in 1968 and 1969. These results show an ecological basis for the pig-Cx. tritaeniorhynchus cycle of Japanese encephalitis virus during the epidemic season in Japan. Anopheles sinensis fed on pigs and cows, while Cx. pipiens pallens was characterized by a wider range of hosts and fed mainly on birds.

N2  - Blood meal sources of Culex pipiens pallens collected in the field during the daytime were serologically identified by the Ouchterlony method. Mosquito collections were made at two stations in two areas 4km apart from each other in the suburbs of Kyoto in 1973 and 1974 by using a drop-net cage and sweeping. Blood removed from the engorged mosquito was tested against ten kinds of antisera. Eight different hosts identified were mammals to reptiles, i. e., bird, dog, cat, cow, pig, mouse, snake and human, showing that the blood meal sources of this mosquito were not restricted to a particular host, but covered a variety of animals. Feedings on birds and dogs made up the greater part of the total identified at the two stations, but the ratio of bird-feeding : dog-feeding differed between the stations suggesting that the host selectivity by this mosquito might vary depending on the availability of host animals.

N2  - Bethylid wasps, Cephalonomia gallicola, were found parasitizing on ca. 28% of anobiid beetles, Stegobium paniceum, occurred in stored oil cakes in Nagoya in 1976. The most frequent site of the parasitism was the ventral abdominal surface of the beetle larvae. With a colony propagated in the laboratory, observed were the following habits of the wasps : 1. The wasps propagated themselves during the period from February to October. The propagation seemed to be most vigorous during July to September. 2. Female wasps oviposited more frequently on the beetle larvae in cocoons. Number of wasp larvae hatched from the cocoonless beetle larvae was ca. 1/5 of that from the larvae in the cocoons. 3. Total developmental period of time of the wasp was about 60 days in the springtime, but 20 to 30 days in the summertime. 4. Hibernated wasp females survived for 60 to 180 days, but males, having mated repeatedly in a short time after emergence, survived less than 10 days. The mating time of the wasps was ca. 2 min in an average. 5. Female wasps were observed, besides ovipositing on the beetle larvae, to kill and consume these larvae. 6. Experimentally, larvae of a ptinid beetles, Gibbium psyllioides, were parasitized by the female wasps.

N2  - We examined the new method for measuring the amount of blood meal in individual mosquitoes using a spectrophotometric technique and the number of microfilariae by membrane filtration method. Aedes togoi were fed on jird parasitized with Brugia malayi and frozen at -20℃ immediately. The midgut containing blood meal was homogenized in 2ml Drabkin's solution [1.0g NaHCO_3,0.1g K_2CO_3,0.05g KCN, 0.2g K_3Fe (CN)_6,in 1 liter distilled water], and incubated at room temperature (20-25℃) for 30min. The homogenate was filtered through Membrane filter (pore size=3μm). The filtrate was transferred to a microcuvette and the optical absorbance was read in a spectrophotometer at 540nm. The blood volume was calculated from the relationship between blood volume and optical absorbance calibrated previously. The homogenizer was washed with 4ml distilled water and the water was filtered through the same membrane to collect the suspected remainder of microfilariae. Then, the membrane was transferred on a glass slide and stained with 0.05% Azur II solution. The number of microfilariae was counted under a microscope. The contamination of Malpighian tubule caused the increase of optical absorbance equal to 0.4 μl blood. The homogenized sample was stable for 2hr and the suitable clearance of homogenizer was 0.2mm in this case.

N2  - In order to estimate the age of the Norway rat, the lens weight was examined using two strains. The data on the mean weight of paired lenses of individual rats were obtained from the wild strain (males 72,females 65) and the Wistar albino strain (males 120,females 88) which were 1 to 24 months old. The relation between the age and the mean weight of paired lenses was given in Figs. 1 and 3. On the basis of the data, regression lines of the mean lens weight (y) to the age (x, log scale) were obtained as follows : Wild strain : male, y=17.68x+8.39 (correlation coefficient r=0.838,t value t_0=32.54,p<0.01), female, y=17.18x+8.36 (r=0.923,t_0=27.40,p<0.01). Wistar albino strain : male, y=18.01x+8.40 (r=0.97,t_0=62.73,p<0.01), female, y=17.29x+8.40 (r=0.975,t_0=57.41,p<0.01). From correlation coefficients and highly significant t value in both strains, it was concluded that the lens weight was closely related to age in the Norway rat and that the age could be estimated by lens weight with high reliability. However, when examining the relationship between the body weight or body length and lens weight at each age by correlation coefficient (r) and its significance, no correlation was observed, with few exceptions (Table 1). No difference was found in lens weight between offsprings born in winter and spring (Table 2). However, between the lens weights of litters kept at low and high densities, there was a significant difference (Table 3). From the results mentioned above, the lens weight method is recognized useful to estimate the age of Norway rats.

N2  - Few studies have been conducted on the biology of chironomid midges occurring in rice paddies, albeit their occurrence in significant number and biomass. This investigation was made for three years from 1977 to 1979 in four paddy plots at 50-km north of Tokyo, which were treated with three different fertilizers and with none. The organic fertilizer plot produced 1,765 midges per square meter per season, followed by the inorganic fertilizer plot producing 1,376. About half numbers were produced in the non-fertilizer and green manure plots. Fifteen species occurred from these paddies. Chironomus kiensis, Tanytarsus sp., Microtendipes sp. and Procladius crassinervis were most abundant in this order. Simpson's diversity index tended to be small at the beginning of the season but became large as it progressed. No spray of agricultural chemicals reduced the chironomid populations appreciably but mid-season drainage did. A significant correlation was obtained between chironomid population size and β-glucosidase activity in soil when 15 physical, chemical and biological characteristics were correlated. Rice leaf cover and phosphate ion concentration were also inversely correlated with the population size.

N2  - Intake of microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus by Simulium ochraceum, the main vector of onchocerciasis in Guatemala, was studied. The initiation of intake of microfilariae was around 30sec after landing. Thereafter, the number of microfilariae taken by flies increased as the feeding time increased. After 3 to 4min of landing, 69% of flies finished their blood meal, and the intake of microfilariae reached the highest. Thereafter, increase of feeding time did not increase the intake. With the volunteers of moderate density of microfilariae (55-116 Mf per 10(mm)^2), the number of microfilariae taken by the flies was correlated with the density of microfilariae in human skin. With a volunteer of very low density (1.8 Mf per 10(mm)^2), however, an extraordinarily high intake of microfilariae was observed. This suggested the possibility of the flies attracting or stimulating the microfilariae in the skin of low density carriers.

N2  - Of the S. ochraceum in Guatemala, the shortest duration from emergence to blood-feeding, from blood-feeding to oviposition (both at 22℃) and from oviposition to next blood-feeding (under the field condition) were presumed to be 2 days, 5 days and 0 day, respectively. One gonotrophic cycle of this species was to be 5 days in the shortest case. The average parous rate observed in the blackflies collected at four locations from October to December, 1977 were 48.7% for S. ochraceum, 41.2% for S. metallicum, 46.9% for S. callidum and 38.9% for S. mexicanum. The parous rate showed diurnal change, those of which captured in the afternoon being somewhat higher. The survival rate of S. ochraceum for 9 days after blood-feeding when this species become infective, was estimated at 27.3%.

N2  - Through bioassay and biological investigations on the alarm pheromone of five species of acarid mites, Aleuroglyphus ovatus, Carpoglyphus lactis, Lardoglyphus konoi and Dermatophagoides farinae, following results were obtained. Citral and neryl formate were more or less active as an alarm pheromone and not strictly species-specific within five species. Along with T. putrescentiae, two more acarid mites, C. lactis and L. konoi, were concluded to possess the alarm pheromone and citral was identified as their pheromone. Citral was emitted to the environment and the quantity of this discharge was 10 to 50 times larger when mites were disturbed than when undisturbed. Furthermore the composition of citral differed significantly between the disturbed (74-86% of neral) and undisturbed conditions (54-66% of neral), that is, the percentage of neral increased when disturbed. The original composition of extracted citral under 1-min soaking consisted of more than 90% of neral in the three species except L. konoi (75% of neral). Therefore the initial composition of citral when discharged from glands is supposed to consist of more than 90% of neral in three species, L. konoi, A. ovatus and D. farinae. Secretory gland of citral was identified as the latero-abdominal gland or the oil gland in all species of mites.

N2  - To know the mosquito fauna and biology in the forest areas of Iriomotejima, Southern Ryukyu Island, Japan, from 1977 to 1978,adult mosquitoes in these area were collected by light traps, human-baited net traps and daytime humanbaited catches, and the larvae were also collected at their breeding sites by a dipper and pipet. The results are summarized as follows : 1. In total, 53 mosquito species of 13 genera were found. Among the species collected, Ficalbia sp., Culex sitiens Wiedemann, Aedes lineatopennis (Ludlow) and Aedes nobukonis Yamada have no previous record in this Island. 2. The total number of nights for light trap operation was 29 in February, July and October, 1977 and 1978,and 2,650 females of 30 species were collected. The predominant species were Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles and Anopheles sinensis Wiedimann including Anopheles lesteri Baisas and Hu, making up 63% of the total catch. A well-known malaria vector, Anopheles minimus Theoblad, was not so common though its 22 females (1%) were collected by the traps in Komiarea. 3. A total of 728 females and 37 males of 24 species was trapped by the human-baited net traps operated for 5 hours of 8 nights at Komi and Funaura areas. Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles (24%), Aedes iriomotensis Tanaka and Mizusawa (20%), Anopheles sinensis Wiedemann (15%), Mansonia uniformis (Theobald) (13%) and Culex pseudovishnui Colles (10%) were predominant species. 4. A total of 330 females of 16 species were collected 15 times by daytime human-baited catches in different forest areas. The predominant species were Aedes iriomotensis Tanaka and Mizusawa (30%), Aedes riversi Bohart and Ingram (19%) and Armigeres subalbatus (Coquillett) (14%). A small number of Anopheles saperoi Bohart and Ingram (=Anopheles ohamai) came to bite. 5. Larvae were collected at about 2,000 breeding sites and 50 species of mosquitoes in total were found in these larvae. Anopheles minimus Theobald was not common but Anopheles saperoi Bohart and Ingram was commonly found along streams in the forest of Komi.

N2  - The spatial distribution pattern of the populations of adult mosquitoes resting in the daytime was estimated by using Morisita's I_δ-index. Mosquitoes were collected once a week in the daytime with a sampling cage at a swamp and adjacent rice fields in the suburbs of Kyoto in 1973 and 1974. I_δ-index was calculated for males, females and the different stages of females (unfed, fed and gravid) as far as possible in Culex pipiens pallens, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis which were the dominant species at each sampling site. As a result, the greater part of I_δ-indices was larger than unity meaning that the spatial distribution was generally the contagious distribution irrespective of species, sex and stage. It was considered that the contagious distribution might chiefly be caused by the environmental gradient such as the differences in light intensity in the resting places.

N2  - As a part of our investigation of the cockroach virus, isolated in 1977 and tentatively placed in the Densovirus group, studies were made of some factors governing the susceptibility of the smoky-brown cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa, to the virus. 1) When infected perorally with the virus, the susceptibility of the late instar nymphs seemed to be higher than that of the first instar nymphs. In the group subjected to intrahemocoeliac infection of the virus, the adults were more susceptible than the late instar nymphs, Thus, it can be said that susceptibility to the virus increases with the age of the cockroaches. 2) The first instar nymphs inoculated perorally with a higher dose of the virus were apparently retarded in their development compared with those inoculated with a lower dose. 3) The late instar nymphs were more susceptible to intrahemocoeliac than peroral infection by the virus. 4) The mean lethal time following virus infection in the late instar nymphs was shortened as the ambient temperature was increased up to 30℃. However, they were resistant to the infection when reared at a higher temperature of 35℃. The minimum effective temperature for the development of the infection was estimated to be 13℃, regardless of the inoculum sizes tested. 5) About 80% of some three hundred late instar nymphs reared in a breeding cage abruptly died over about two months. The cause was later determined to be the virus infection because of symptoms peculiar to the virus infection and successful recovery of the virus from the dead cockroaches.

N2  - The natural infection of mosquitoes with the viruses of Getah complex was studied in Fukuoka area in the period from 1963 to 1972. During the period, virus isolation attempts were held with 205,095 females of Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles and 7,636 females of the other four species of mosquitoes, and 254 isolates were obtained. All the isolates came from the C. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes. Nine of them were tentatively identified as the viruses of Getah complex through the hemagglutination-inhibition tests. The results of the perennial searches for the viruses in the mosquitoes showed that the natural infection with the viruses occasionally took place among C. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes but never became prevalent among them in the area.

N2  - An ecological study of the mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis, was carried out at two typical habitats in Tokushima City (34°4′N) in Japan from September 1975 to March 1977. The first habitat (St. 1) was a pond in a park, about 500m^2 in area and about 1.5m deep..Shrimp (Palaemon paucidens), crayfish (Cambaroides japonicus and Procambarus clarki), and carp (Cyprinus carpio) were present but no particular food had been given to them. The other habitat (St. 2) was an irrigation ditch of brackish water, 1.2-2m wide and 10-50cm deep. Crayfish, crucian carp (Carassius gibelio langsdorfi), and tadpoles (Rana catesbeiana etc.) were present in this habitat. The differences in the ecology and physiology of the fish at the two stations were as follows. 1. The rate of young fish in the breeding season was lower at St. 1 than at St. 2. 2. Fecundity was significantly lower at St. 1 than at St. 2. 3. The beginning of the breeding season was earlier at St. 2 than at St. 1. 4. The gonadosomatic index (GSI=wet ovary weight×100/wet body weight) was lower at St. 1. than St. 2. 5. No increase of the female hepatosomatic index (HSI=wet liver weight×100/wet body weight) before the breeding season occurred at St. 1. 6. An abnormal parenchyma of male liver was observed only at St. 1. From these observations, it is suggested that foods for the fish are scarce at St. 1. Many Gambusia were overwintering at places more than 50cm deep in both St. 1 and 2. Such overwintering places will be necessary to maintain a stock population of the fish for the use of biological control.

N2  - A small scale field trial applying oil spray formulation of six kinds of insecticides-1% fenitrothion, 1% malathion, 0.5% diazinon, 0.5% fenthion, 0.5% naled and 0.3% dichlorvos-was carried out in Saitama Prefecture during August-Novenber, 1976 in order to determine the practical effective dosage as well as the duration of activity for the control of mosquito larvae. It was confirmed that minimum effective rates of application of the oil formulations were 5-10ml per m^2. Although the spreading capacity of these formulations over water surfaces was good enough, the effectiveness continued for 2 days for fenitrothion and diazinon, and only one daysfor the other insecticides. In autumm however, the residual effects extended remarkably more than those described above in all the oil solution type insecticides, especially in diazinon. Naled was inferior in this respect.

N2  - The authors (1978b) described the mites of house-hold pet animals and their pathogenic effects on the owners. Since then, four species of mites were obtained from cats, a rabbit, and budgerigars. The mites detected were Cheyletiella blakei (Smiley, 1970) from two cats, Cheyletiella parasitivorax (Megnin, 1878) from a rabbit, and feather mites belonging to the family Dermoglyphidae (Megnin et Troussart, 1883) and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Shrank, 1781) from some of the budgerigars. Of these four species of mite, C. blakei and C. parasitivorax are suspected to attack the owners of the animals.

N2  - To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of sumithion, DDT and malathion for the control of Anopheles balabacensis balabecensis Baisas, the main malaria vector in Sabah, a small-scale field trial was carried out in the Kuala Penyu district in 1976-1977. Two rounds of sumithion and DDT spraying were implemented in October 1976 and June 1977 and three rounds of malathion spraying in October 1976,March and September 1977. The effectiveness of each insecticide was evaluated by indoor and outdoor man-biting, floor sheet, exit window trap collections, vector age determination of female mosquitoes and biological evaluation. The indoor man-biting and resting density was reduced considerably in sumithion and malathion huts after spraying. In the DDT hut the density was drastically reduced to virtually nil. No change in outdoor biting was observed in any of the three stations and there was a marked repellency towards An. bal. balabacensis in the early months after DDT spraying. No increase in the exodus of mosquitoes was observed from sprayed huts but there was a rise in the number of unfeds leaving the sumithion hut after the 1st spraying cycle. Exit trap and total mortalities decline up to 8 and 5 months after sumithion and malathion applications respectively. Huts sprayed with sumithion and malathion exerted a considerable toxic effect on mosquitoes in cages suspended within the enclosed rooms without contact with treated surfaces. At dosages of 2.0g/m^2 the two insecticides gave effective kills (70-100%) for periods of 4-4 1/2 months, based on 1/2-hour exposure to the treated surfaces.

Genus Episymploce Bey-Bienko A redefined generic diagnosis of Episymploce, compared with those of Symploce s. str., is as follows : a. Male supraanal plate divided distally or asymmetrically formed, usually with a sharp median incision with ventral spinous projection (s). b. Male hypandrium definitely asymmetrical, its extreme base furnished with sharp spine (s) on each side. c. The lateral margin of 9th tergite covers the sides of hypandrium, sometimes provided with a small spine on this margin. d. In all the species examined left phallosome of males sickle-shaped, turning at right angle with the "handle" abruptly thickened. e. Female supraanal plate is, in general, slightly divided at the apex. 9. Episymploce sinensis (Walker) A remarkable reddish brown species with broad black marginal area in the wings. Shiraki (1931) misidentified one female of this species as a male Blattid, "Periplaneta apicalis Shiraki" together with a female of a Hebardina species! The type locality of sinensis (Walker) is "Hong Kong", then recorded from "Peking" and "Nanking". In Taiwan this species seems to be very rare. 10a. Episymploce formosana formosana (Shiraki) As stated in my previous Note, Shiraki (1931) synonymized this species with "Ischnoptera modestiformis Karny", but I found that this is a good species examining both the type materials. Perhaps not uncommon in Taiwan. Based on the description and type material Shiraki's "Ischnoptera asymmetrica" appears a synonym of this species. 10b. Episymploce formosana yoshinoe (Shiraki) In examining the type material of "yoshinoe" preserved in the National Taiwan University the prothorax and wings are much broader than those of "formosana". But since I could not recognize any distinct difference in the structure of male hypandrium I now lower yoshinoe on a subspecific level of formosana. In this connection I have never found Shiraki's "yoshinoe var. brevielytra" in the collection of National Taiwan University, there was, instead, a female labelled "makiana n. sp." (nom. nud.) which also appears to be a formosana yoshinoe. 11. Episymploce princisi nov. Karny (1915) misidentified this species to be Burmese "Ischnoptera multiramosa Brunner v. W." which seems quite different from ours at least in the absence of dark spots on the prothorax. Princis's new name "karnyi" is a nomen nudum, and since no reliable description has ever been made I gave it here based upon my new material taken in the mountains of Taiwan. 12. Episymploce amamiensis Asahina This slender species is allied to the preceeding one at least in the presence of paired dark stripes on the prothorax, but differs from princisi in the character of male hypandrium and female supraanal plate. Distributed from Amami Islands as far north as Yakushima. 13. Episymploce yashiroi (Shiraki) A small pale brownish species, first described from Okinawa and later found rather common throughout the other Ryukyu Islands south of Okinawa. I examined one male specimen taken in Taiwan (Baibara, in coll. Hokkaido Univ.), and believe that "Symploce taiwanica Bey-Bienko" (1969) is the same species. Several Episymploce specimens in the Micronesian collection (♂♂♀♀ Babeldaub, Palau Islands) seem also the same or very closely allied species, and I even suppose "Symploce vietnami Bey-Bienko" taken in Vietnam appear to be yashiroi if seen from the brief picture given by Bey-Bienko. 14. Episymploce taiheizana nov. A very slender species with a round dark spot on the prothorax. Confined to Taiheizan Mountains in North Taiwan. Genus Scalida Hebard Superficially these insects look small-sized Episymploce. The hypandrium is extremely asymmetrical and the styli are very much developed. More than twenty species are known from Southeast Asia. 15. Scalida schenklingi (Karny) I have examined one of Karny's syntypes. This seems to be widely distributed in the lowland of Taiwan. In many of the individuals there is a pair of dark spots on the prothorax. I agree Princis (1969) to treat S. biguttata Bey-Binko (1954,1957) and S. biguttata unicolor Bey-Bienko (1954) to be synonymous with schenklingi (Karny).

N2  - The flies occurring from dungs of the wild brown bear, Ursus arctos yesoensis Lydekker, were investigated in Hokkaido from 1976 to 1978. The following ten species were reared from 14 dungs collected in mountainous areas : Lasiomma octoguttatum (Zetterstedt), L. iwasai Suwa, Pyrellia tateyamensis Shinonaga, Mesembrina resplendens Wahlberg, Helina deleta (Stein), Mydaea sp., Fannia canicularis (Linnaeus), Fannia sp., Sepsis monostigma Thomson and Sargus metallinus Fabricius. The first three species were predominant in number among flies reared.

N2  - A standard method for evaluation of the relative effectiveness of insecticides on Chironomid larvae was developed. After 24 hours exposure to insecticide in a beaker, Golenkinia radiata, a kind of green algae was added as a nest material and one hour later the success or failure in making a nest by Chironomid larvae was assessed. Most species used made a nest within 15 minutes, normally when the algae were added. The larvae suffered from the insecticide could not make a nest at all or could not complete a nest. There was no significant difference between the dose-response regression based on the deadalive method and that based on the method of success-failure of nest making. However, the latter was superior as a criterion because of the clarity and easiness of evaluation, compared with the dead-alive method in which some alive larvae would be regarded as dead. The variation of mortality in Chironomid larvae due to the difference in exposure period to the insecticide from 24 hours to 72 hours was studied. No significant difference could be found in some species in the 50 percent lethal concentration, whereas some other species showed approximately four times the difference in the concentration between a 24-hour exposure and a 48-hour exposure. Susceptibility of four species of Chironomid larvae to various insecticides was evaluated by the method of success-failure of nest making. The dead-alive method, however, was applied to Procladius sp. which dose not make a nest. Paratanytarsus parthenogenetica, which had been colonized in the laboratory, was the most susceptible in general to the insecticides tested, whereas Chironomus yoshimatsui, which is an inhabitant of drains and one of the important pest insects in Japan, showed a rather high tolerance to most insecticides. Temephos showed a high toxicity with Chironomid larvae in the present study. However, Procladius sp. showed exceptionally low susceptibility to this insecticide.

N2  - The emergence inhibitory effect of a juvenile hormone analogue, methoprene, was evaluated for the larvae of the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), by the fly medium method and dipping method in the labaratory. In both methods no larva was apparently effected in pupation, but many pupae were inhibited from emergence. By the fly medium method most emergences were inhibited by the concentrations above three ppm, except a single fly with three-ppm treatment. Among the emerging adults treated with lower concentrations, malformed flies with reduced wings and tiny body size appeared frequently. The malformation ratio increased with higher concentrations. By dissecting dead puparia inhibited from emergence under a binocular microscope, the state of metamorphosis inside was morphologically examined. Many remained in larval form in control. On the contrary, most of them in treatment finished adult morphogenesis and reached the pre-emergence state, completing cuticularization and pigmentation and having apparently normal bodies. A number of malformed adult forms with the incomplete abdominal segmentation inside puparia appeared in higher concentrations by the fly medium method. Therefore, it was hypothesized that methoprene might act inhibitorily on the emergence mechanism and metamorphosis in the pupal stage of stable flies.

N2  - Insecticidal effect of a nonionic surfactant, polyoxyethylene (6 mols) lauryl ether (PEL) on the housefly was studied to clarify its usefulness for the fly-control at Hokko Wastes Disposal Site in Osaka Bay. The LD_<50> values of PEL were about 270μg/female for the organophosphorus insecticide resistant Hokko colony and about 260μg/female for the susceptible Takatsuki strain, respectively. The mortality rates of Hokko colony were 95% when submerged in 0.3% PEL solution for 320sec and 100% in 0.6% solution for 40sec, respectively. In the indoor spray, 89.2% were killed with 15-sec spray of 0.3% solution, and all with 10-sec spray of 0.6% solution. In the field test, the reduction rate was very low when the 0.5% solution (1l/m^2) was sprayed at low speed of 0.1l/sec. But the reduction rates of 50-91% were obtained when sprayed at high speed of 10l/sec. It is considered that, in spite of its relative low effect, PEL is useful as a supplemental means for the control of resistant housefly, because its lethal mechanism (perhaps suffocation) differs from that of organophosphorus insecticide resistance.

N2  - The Japanese and Taiwanese cockroach species belonging to the tribe Ischnopterites appear taxonomically in a chaotic condition. From this area Karny and Shiraki described in total 12 species and one variety of "Ischnoptera", but eight of them were rearranged in Princis' Catalogue into four genera, and four were left as "species incertae sedis." While accumulating material since 1950 from Japan and Taiwan I checked the type-specimens preserved in Hokkaido University, National Taiwan University, and Karny's material (Hans Sauter Collection) now preserved in the Deutsches Entomologisches Institut, Eberswalde, East Germany. In the present work I started from a recognition of a well-known American species, Symploce capitata (Saussure) which seems rather near to the type-species, Symploce hebardi Princis. In this paper an attempt was made to revise nine species and two subspecies which seem referable to the genus Symploce sensu strictu. A subsequent part of this revision will treat the representatives of a redefined genus Episymploce. Since a comprehensive world revision of Ischnopterites has not been made, the recent splitting of Symploce and its allied forms seems to embody various problems which should be revised in a future occasion. Symploce capitata (Saussure)(Fig. 1,A-C; Fig. 4,A, B; Fig. 5,A-J) As an only American Symploce species at hand I gave here a description and illustrations including the male phallosome. Although I don't believe that this species, with its brachypterous female, is a very good example of American Symploce the shape of the phallosome gives much different impression from Eastasiatic representatives. 1a. Symploce striata striata (Shiraki) (Fig. 1,D-F; Fig. 4,C; Fig. 6,A-D) A medium-sized chestnut colored species with yellowish costa of the wings. Female wings are more or less shortened. For structural details see accompanying figures. Found among decayed vegetable matters and hibernates in a mature larval stage, adults are frequent in early season. This South Japanese species ranges from southern coast of Honshu (northernmost locality is Ako, Hyogo Pref.) to Takarajima in the Central Ryukyus, including, probably, whole Shikoku, Kyushu, Tsushima and Tanegashima, but absent from Amamioshima, Okinawa and Yayeyama Islands. 1b. Symploce striata wulaii subsp. nov. (Fig. 1,G, H; Fig. 4,D; Fig. 6,E-G) Allied closely to the preceding nominate subspecies but slightly larger in size. Body coloration almost same with it, but is provided with paler face in the males. The tergite of the terminal abdominal segment has median tuft of hairs in the male. Confined to Taiwan. 2. Symploce yayeyamana sp. nov. (Fig. 1,I; Fig. 7,A-D) This may be the vicariant geographical race of the former two. The most remarkable character is the long and sharply pointed styli on the hypandrium. Only one male specimen taken from Ishigaki Island was available. 3a. Symploce gigas gigas sp. nov. (Fig. 2,A-D; Fig. 4,E; Fig. 8,A-F) A large pale brownish species, misidentified by Karny (1915) and Shiraki (1931) to be "Ischnoptera australis Saussure 1863" from Australia. For diagnostic characters refer accompanying figures. Abdominal tergites have the tuft of hairs on 1,7 and 10 segments. Found from Yayeyama Islands (Iriomote and Ishigaki) and Taiwan, The Taiwanese materials are always slightly smaller in size but no racial difference is recognized. 3b. Symploce gigas okinawana subsp. nov. (Fig. 2,E, F; Fig. 4,F; Fig. 9,A-H) Differing from the nominate form by the smaller and slender body, the shape of prothoracic tergite is distinctly narrow. Mainly taken from Okinawa Island. Those taken from Amami and Okinoerabu Islands were females, and one female from Iriomote Island is a very small, short-winged insect. 4. Symploce japonica (Shelford) (Fig. 3,A, B; Fig. 4,G, H; Fig. 10,A-F) For this species refer my 1974 paper. Distributed in South Kyushu, and southwards to Amami Islands. A short-winged robust species. 5. Symploce okinoerabuensis Asahina (Fig. 11,A-E) Found from a cave in Okinoerabu Island, see my 1974 paper for detail. 6. Symploce miyakoensis Asahina (Fig. 11,F) Also a cavernicolous species, one female was found in Miyako Island. 7. Symploce furcata (Shiraki) (Fig. 3,C, D; Fig. 4,I; Fig. 12. A-C) A pale brownish slender species, characterized by the shallowly divided male terminal tergite of abdomen. Though the description of Shiraki is very inadequate the shape of abdominal end and the presence of bifurcated Cu vein in the hind wing may be of diagnostic value. Taken from the mountains of Taiwan and from Ishigaki Island. 8. Symploce acuminata (Shiraki) (Fig. 3,E, F; Fig. 13,A-D) Two brachypterous specimens taken by the late Dr. Tadao Kano from high altitude of Taiwan were determined. There remains some doubt from final identification which should be made in future upon fresh materials. 9. Symploce (?) modestiformis (Karny) (Fig. 3,G-I; Fig. 14,A-F) A slender pale yellowish species, once erroneously synonymized with "Ischnoptera formosana Shiraki, 1908" by Shiraki. By checking Karny's types I found that this is a rather peculiar species with very simple feature in the hypandrium and unique phallosome never found among any species of Ischnopterites I have examined. Does it represent a different generic status?

N2  - The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the lipids were carried out for following 5 species of grain mites, Carpoglyphus lactis (C. l.), Tyrophagus putrescentiae (T. p.), Aleuroglyphus ovatus (A. o.), Lardoglyphus konoi (L. k.) and Dermatophagoides farinae (D. f.). Each mite sample was separated to adult, nymph and larva by a sieving method, and their lipid solution were collected in a chloroform-methanol mixture (2 : 1). Total lipid contents in adult mites were as follows : T. p. 2.1%, L. k. 2.9%, A. o. 2.4%, C. l. 2.6%, and D. f. 1.6% under the wet condition. Thin layer chromatography revealed the same lipid classes in five grain mites; cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, cholesterol, free fatty acids, and monoglycerides as neutral lipids, and phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin as phospholipids. By the quantitative determination of neutral lipids, it was also revealed that triglyceride constituted more than 50% of neutral lipids in the mites of four species except D. f., in which free fatty acids constituted a high proportion as much as 57% of neutral lipids. Thus, there were significant quantitative differences both in the total lipid contents and the profile of the neutral lipids between D. f. and the other four species.

N2  - The chemical structure and cross resistance relationships of organophosphorus insecticides in houseflies were studied. The tested houseflies, Musca domestica L., highly resistant to insecticides were collected from a dumping island of Tokyo Bay in 1975. (LD)_<50> values of 60 organophosphorus compounds against the resistant and susceptible flies (Takatsuki strain) were obtained by a topical application method. This resistant strain had a remarkably wide range of cross resistance to most of the organophosphorus insecticides. However, there were some interested compounds showing the resistance ratios less than ten. They were ethylphosphonothionates, S-propyl phosphorothiolothionates and thiolates, salithion and methidathion.

N2  - Ovarian and embryonic development of the fleshfly was studied with special reference to the effect of chemosterilant, hempa. Histological and volumetric changes of the follicles after their emergence showed that oogenic period was about 10 days. The oocytes initiated development at 4th day of adult stage and completed at 10th day. Then matured eggs descended to the uterus and the embryogenesis took place. By the treatment of hempa, the ovarian development was inhibited conspicuously with the increase of dose and treatment period of hempa. Continual treatment of 0.5% hempa induced complete inhibition of ovarian maturation. Histological studies indicated that hempa causes collapse of follicles and finally degeneration of follicles.

N2  - Net water movement between standardized mites and ambient air was measured by weight changes in fasting mites. The ambient vapor activity, a_v, is humidity indicated as R.H./100. The minimum humidity from which a mite can extract water is expressed as the critical equilibrium activity (CEA). Standardized females of Dermatophagoides microceras were exposed to eight different vapor activities of 0.50 to 0.85 for 24hours using glycerol-water mixtures. The weight change for each activity was recorded as the net change in weight in 24hours, ΔW_<24>. Values of ΔW_<24> were directly proportional to activities of 0.50 to 0.70 (A). However, in activities from 0.75 to 0.85,values of ΔW_<24> were not significantly different, so they were averaged (B). The CEA is calculated by A and B. It is determined to be 0.72. In dry air (a_v 0.00), weight losses were monitored for 48 hours using standardized females. Mites lost water rapidly initially and then more gradually. Transpiration occurred from two compartments (two types of water losses : fast and slow compartments). The mean water mass of the fast compartment at time 0 is 1.15μg and it disappears at a rate of 19.76% each hour; thus rate constant equals 0.1976. The mean water mass of the slow compartment at time 0 is 4.09μg and its rate constant is 0.0027.

N2  - The mandibles, maxillae and hypostomium of Simulium (Wilhelmia) takahashii larvae from Japan are described and illustrated with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. The scanning electron micrographs are useful in understanding the complicated mouthparts, and show for the first time that there is a concave space between the hypostomial teeth and the anterior margin of the hypostomium.

N2  - A survey of gamasid mites found on small rodents was carried out in a wind-shelter belt at Tonden, Sapporo, from April 1973 to June 1974. A total of 843 gamasid mites was collected from 291 rodents (Table 1). Clethrionomys rufocanus bedfordiae (57.4% of all rodents captured), C. rutilus mikado (32.0%) and Apodemus giliacus (8.6%) were the most common. Of the gamasid mites, the majority consisted of three species, Androlaelaps fahrenholzi, Hirstionyssus isabellinus and Haemogamasus sp. (Uchikawa, 1969), totalling 72.7% of all mites. The order of dominance of the above three species of mites was equal for both species of Clethrionomys. No Laelaps clethrionomydis was collected in this locality. The infestation frequency and the number of mites on the hosts were expressed as I/M±m, where I is percent of infested hosts of all hosts examined, M mean number of mites per infested host, and m standard error. The infestation frequency of A. fahrenholzi and of Haemogamasus sp. on C. rufocanus was higher in spring and lower in autumn. However, on C. rutilus, the infestation frequency fluctuated every other season (Table 2). Of H. isabellinus, a high infestation frequency was recorded from spring to summer and no mites were found in winter on both voles. The mean number of A. fahrenholzi on each vole was high in winter, and that of Haemogamasus sp. and H. isabellinus was high in spring. Generally, Clethrionomys voles were more heavily infested by gamasid mites than A. giliacus. And there were no great differences in infestation between Clethrionomys voles, on the whole.

N2  - Five human cases involved in two families infested with feline scabies, Notoedres cati Hering, 1838,were reported. Notoedrosis in the present patients had its source in scabby cats kept as an animal pet. The eruptions observed on the skin were diagnostically similar to those of human scabies caused by Sarcoptes scabiei, but no mites nor scabby tunnels were found in the skin of the patients. Human cases of feline scabies infestation in Japan were also discussed.

N2  - The relationships between physico-chemical characters of water in rice fields and their suitability for breeding of the mosquito larvae, Anopheles sinensis were studied during the summer in 1974. The census fields (B-G) were located in the suburb of Urawa city 20km north of Tokyo. Census fields ranged 0.5-3.0 are containing about 1,600 hills of rice plants per are. The water sample was taken with the use of the quadrat device (25×25cm) which was pushed firmly into the bottom mud in rice field (Ikemoto, 1976). Temperature, quantity, pH, and concentration of DO and NH_4-N of the water sampled were determined with the instruments or by the chemical analysis. The collected immature mosquitoes were classified into larvae of successive instars and pupae. It was shown that there is a positive correlation between the number of larvae (pupae inclusive) and the concentration of NH_4-N in the water sampled within the field at the same time. Moreover, the relation of the mean number of immature mosquitoes and the mean concentration of NH_4-N in each field during the summer was shown to be positive in correlation, at least, within the range from 0.1 to 0.4ppm of concentration. However, the relations between the larval density and the other characters of the water were not clear. Some discussions were given on the relation between the spatial distribution patterns of immature stages of this mosquito (Ikemoto, 1978) and the heterogeneity of the habitat water conditions presented in this paper. Further studies are needed to prove the propriety of the assumption that the NH_4-N concentrations within a field or among the fields have some positive relations with the oviposition preference of adults, the abundance of immature stages and their survival rates.

N2  - Experiments and analysis were made about the evaluation method of insecticidal efficacies against the German cockroach in the field. The data discussed in the present study were obtained by spraying a mixed emulsifiable concentrate (EC) of fenitrothion (5%) with phthalthrin (0.5%) and iodofenphos (10% EC) at ten stations comprising restaurants, snacks, and bars ih Nagoya City, Japan, infested with the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). The reduction rate is given by the following formula; y=(x-z)/x×100 (1) where, y is the reduction rate, and x and z are the means of cockroaches trapped before and after treatment, respectively. It is considered that the mean of cockroaches decreased (numerator of the formula) varies depending on the mean of cockroaches trapped before treatment. The relation between them will be given by the following formula; D=mx+n (2) where, D is the mean of cockroaches decreased, and m and n are the regression coefficients; 0≦m≦1,n≦0. Substitution of (2) into (1) gives y=(m+n/x)×100 (3) Thus, the reduction rate can be shown by these parameters and the mean of cockroaches trapped before treatment. As the equation (3) is a fractional function of x, m represents asymptote parallel to x-axis as well as the limit of the reduction rate. Replacing 1/x in the equation (3) with X, it can be rewritten as follows; y=(m+nX)×100 (4) This indicates that the reduction rate can be shown by a linear equation. From the above equations, it can be expected that the reduction rate takes the high value when both m and x are large enough and n is relatively smaller. Since confidence intervals of both m and n can be calculated by regression analysis, insecticidal efficacies can be evaluated by these values. When the above method is introduced into the analysis of data in the present study, no significant difference in the reduction rates was shown between the two insecticides sprayed.

N2  - In 1931 Shiraki described a new cockroach species "Phyllodromia kumamotonis" from Kumamoto, Kyushu, based on a single female specimen. Later Shiraki gave a brief description of it in Japanese (1950), but nothing has been added to the real taxonomic status of this insect. Recently this was listed in Princis' world Catalogue (1969) as belonging to the genus Margattea. Since 1952 I have accumulated my own material from South Japan, i.e., Kyushu and its annexed islands, Tsushima, Tanegashima, and from the area along the Pacific coast of Honshu up to Chiba Prefecture. From the islands of Amami, Okinawa, Yayeyama and Taiwan we found a rather pale coloured Margattea allied to kumamotonis. The other three cockroach forms were also added including one Taiwanese species. In 1973 I had an opportunity to check the type specimens of Taiwanese "Theganopteryx perspicillaris Karny" preserved in the Institut fur Pflanzenschutzforschung at Eberswalde, D. D. R. and foundthat it is one of the cockroaches now we are considering. This year (1978) Kumar and Princis established a new genus Theganosilpha recognizing "Theganopteryx perspicillaris" as type-species and emphasized the presense of serration on the tarsal claws as a generic character. From this procedure it became clear that the Taiwanese large-sized insect is Theganosilpha perspicillaris and the other two from South Japan are new Theganosilpha species closely allied to the first species.

N2  - A limited field trial was undertaken in Labuan Island Sabah to determine if larvicidal treatment of open containers of stored water could achieve effective control of Aedes aegypti, a vector of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever. The insecticide used was abate 1% sand granules and the method of evaluation was the single-larva-per-container method. The lethal effect on Ae. aegypti of each application of abate at a concentration of 1ppm lasted 3 to 3.5 months and was clearly reflected in the resurgence and reinfestation of the species. A higher proportion of the larvae collected from indoor containers were Ae. aegypti. Ae. albopictus larvae in outdoor water collections tended to increase markedly during the trial. The mean Breteau index of aegypti was reduced from 83.6 before larviciding to 24.7 four months after. The final Breteau index after 11 months was 10.5 and the mean premise index fell from 52.9% to 7.6%. Ae. aegypti comprized 64.8% of the larval collections, Ae. albopictus 28.3% and other species, principally Culex pipiens fatigans 6.9%. The single-larva-per-container technique provided a useful quantitative measure of the larval densities in the treated areas.

N2  - To study the mode of utilization of a space in Periplaneta fuliginosa (S) sooted papers were set on the floor, wall and shelves in a bare room and the frequency of tracking by them was observed ('the tracking method'). Catching by butter traps was carried out in the same study and the following results were obtained. 1. The sooted papers set on the wall side of the floor were clearly clawed off, and the frequency of track printing showed evidently higher degree with a width of about 5cm along the wall side on the papers than the rest part of those. This fact indicates that the cockroach has tendency apt to crawl along vertical phase (ex. the wall). On the contrary, papers set at the central zone of the room were not clawed off so frequently and track was layed in various directions. It seems, therefore, that the cockroach did not move to central zone so frequently in such bare room. 2. The papers set on a wall had tracks along lintels and skirting board. The highest degree of tracking frequency could be observed on the papers set on the top board of shelves. 3. From these characteristic tracking results it was ascertained that the cockroaches mainly moved along the third dimension in the three dimentional phase in their habitat at where they could move freely. 4. A correlative concept was able to designed from the results obtained by butter trapping and tracking method whenever comparison was done with the same point in the field. It seems, therefore, that the butter trapping would roughly inform the mode of utilization of a space in this species as well as other information (s) if fairly many traps were employed. Besides, the tracking method using sooted paper seemed to be convenient for population census when density of the insect was seemed not so high.

N2  - Ten species of horseflies, totally 2,000 individuals, were collected at 7 station in Toyama, Iwate or Aomori Prefecture, either by dry-ice trap or by sweeping. Their nectar-sucking behaviors were discussed after microscopic as well as chemical examinations on nectars ingested. 1. The overall nectar sucking rate in total individuals was 82%, among which, part of the large-sized horseflies, such as Tabanus chrysurus and T. katoi showing rather lower rate. The distribution of nectar-sucking degree was, fully-sucked 10%, and medium and few 36% each. 2. The largest quantity of nectars sucked was 41μl in T. chrysurus, 35μl in T. katoi, 20μl in T. rufidens and T. trigeminus, 14μl T. humilis and T. sapporoensis, and 13μl in T. iyoensis. 3. The sugar concentration of nectars sucked ranged from 16.6% to 77.5% and there seemed to exist a tendency that the smaller the size of the species, the higher the sugar concentration. 4. The distribution of nectars after ingestion was, in general, limited only in the diverticulum, while, in 24% of T. iyoensis, in 10% of T. sapporoensis and in 6% of T. rufidens, nectars were found also in the midgut. 5. Paper chromatographic analysis of nectars indicated that 88% of the individuals possessed fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose, and 63% of then additionally possessed raffinose and/or melibiose. 6. Judging from the appearance rate of fully nectar-sucked individuals among those coming for blood sucking, the diurnal activity of nectar-sucking in T. iyoensis, T. sapporoensis, T. humilis and T. rufidens seemed to be parallel to the blood-sucking activity. 7. Comparison of nectar-sucking between the autogenic T. iyoensis and strongly blood-sucking (anautogenic) T. chrysurus revealed that there was little difference in the rate and degree of nectar-sucking as well as the composition and concentration of sugars. A significant difference was observed only in the distribution of nectars after ingestion, that is, in T. iyoensis nectars were detected also in the midgut. This seemed to be a distinctive character of the autogenic species, since the same distribution pattern was observed also in T. sapporoensis and T. rufidens, which belong to the same autogenic species group.

N2  - Niclosamide (5,2'-dichloro-4-nitro-salicylicamide), B-2 (Sodium 2,5-dichloro-4-bromophenol) and Yurimin (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-4'-nitroazobenzene) were tested for their toxicity against fish using juveniles of the guppy. The juveniles provided for this test were those of a yellow strain selected at National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan. The juveniles had been seperated into two groups soon after parturition, one with food and another without food and they had been kept until 18th day when high mortality occurred among the preserved population without food. Among the three chemicals tested, Yurimin and Niclosamide had high toxicity to the juveniles and B-2 was slightly lower in its toxicity. In the case of B-2,LC_<50> values between the batch with food and that without food did not differ till 2 days after parturition but thereafter differentiated with age. Namely, the batch with food increased gradually the tolerance against the chemical, whereas the starved batch did not change the susceptibility up to 10 days after parturition. On the contrary, the LC_<50> value decreased lineally with the age of juveniles, when Niclosamide was tested. The results would suggest the usefulness of the juveniles of the guppy as a standard fish in testing the toxicity of chemicals.

N2  - The influence of temperature on the development of two housefly populations, organophosphorus insecticide-resistant Hokko colony and susceptible Takatsuki strain, was studied in the present experiments, using two kinds of culture medium with different initial water content (approximately 33 and 50% respectively). Two hundreds larvae were reared in one container receiving 150g of medium, and two or three containers were used in each experiment. The viability of Hokko colony was more than 90% at 20°-35℃ and a little lower at 15℃, but its mortality was very high at 40℃. Takatsuki strain showed the same tendency as Hokko colony except that viability was approximately 60% at 35℃ (Takatsuki was not reared at 15℃). The relation between mean medium temperature (t) and rate of development (ν) in Hokko colony could be expressed in, ν=0.0082t-0.0810,for egg-larval period, ν=0.0120t-0.1376,for pupal period, and ν=0.0049t-0.0522,for egg-pupal period. And Takatsuki strain showed the same tendency at 20°-35℃. The developmental zeros and thermal constants calculated from these equations were 9.9℃ and 122 day-degrees in egg-larval stage, 11.5℃ and 83 day-degrees in pupal stage, and 10.7℃ and 203 day-degrees in egg-pupal stage, respectively. The results in egg-pupal stage were compared with those obtained by other investigators and found to be suitable to them at temperatures below 30℃. The body weight of pupae was lighter when larvae were reared at higher temperature or in culture medium of lower initial water content. And pupae of Hokko colony were heavier than those of Takatsuki strain at 35℃. By comparing the present results to those of others, it is considered that the suitable temperature range for development of the housefly lies between 17°-35℃, and developmental zero and critical high temperature are approximately 10° and 40℃, respectively. The reason for lightening effect of lower initial water content on the body weight of pupae is considered that available food quantity was smaller at lower water content, where the greater part of medium was dried more quickly. In comparison between two populations, there were no distinct differences in duration of development. It may be, however, concluded that, Takatsuki strain, at least the present sub-strain, in immature stage is inferior in the adaptability to higher temperature of 35℃, for it shows lower viability and the body weight of its pupae is lighter than Hokko colony.

N2  - A survey of the habitats of Aedes albopictus and Ae. riversi was carried out in selected locations in the southwestern part of Japan during the summer seasons of 1975 and 1976. It was observed that Ae. albopictus attacked human bait predominantly in open areas near densely populated regions while Ae. riversi preferred mostly at sparsely populated forested areas for feeding. The larvae of both species were found equally in both artifical breeding containers such as discarded cans and natural breeding containers such as tree holes, bamboo stumps. Therefore, differences of the habitat of each species seemed to be due to their flight places whether in open areas or in forested areas.

N2  - A chironomid species breeding commonly in sewage ditches and urban streams in Japan had been called until recently by a Japanese name of 'sesuji-yusurika' or by a scientific name of Chironomus dorsalis Meigen, but was recently shown to be a new species, Chironomus yoshimatsui Martin and Sublette, 1972. In the present study commenced by the author and his colleagues in 1976,collections of all stages of chironomids in the fields as well as their laboratory rearings have been conducted, for taxonomic and biological investigations of this little known insect group. Among several species of the flaviplumus group found breeding in pools in Tsukuba and Tokyo, a species almost identical in the structure of male hypopygium and coloration to Chironomus dorsalis of Strenzke (1959) was named by Sasa (1978) as a new species, Chironomus strenzkei. However, it was eventually shown that this tribial name was preoccupied by another Amazonian species by Fittkau (1968), and thus a new name, Chironomus nippodorsalis, is proposed to replace C. strenzkei of Sasa (1978).

N2  - The susceptibility of five common species of mosquitoes in Japan to the infective stage of mermithid nematode Romanomermis culicivorax was examined. The incidence of parasitism was highest in Culex pipiens molestus, followed by Cx. p. pallens, Aedes albopictus, Ae. togoi, Armigeres subalbatus. Effect of type of nematode introduction and host arrangement was studied. 2400 nematodes in infective stage were released in a 6.5×120cm stagnant water path, comparing two types of introduction. In the 1st type nematodes mixed well in overall water and in the 2nd type nematodes were introduced at an end of the path. Eight screened containers 30 larvae of Cx. p. molestus each were variously located. Parasitism was highest when nematodes were mixed in overall water and the larvae were held in 8 locations. No parasites were recovered when nematodes were introduced at an end and the larvae located 120cm away. When nematodes introduced at an end and the larvae were placed every 15cm from the point of introduction, the parasitism was highest at the nearest place from the released spot. Number of parasites recovered (N) is given as N=-48.4 log D+96,where D is distance from the released point. These findings indicate that the nematodes in infective stage may not disperse more than 100cm in stagnant water.

N2  - The emergence time of two black-flies, Simulium (Simulium) arakawae and S. (Gnus) bidentatum, were observed in the laboratory by rearing field-caught pupae in Kagoshima, Japan. Under natural condition, most flies of both species were found to emerge during the daylight period with the peak of emergence between 6 : 00 and 12 : 00. There was no sexual difference in emergence time. When pupae were set under continuous light or reversed light-dark cycle conditions, they emerged during the period corresponding to daylight period of normal condition. These results indicate that the emergence pattern is probably controled by the rhythm which was established by the light-dark cycle during larval stage.

N2  - Critical examinations were directed towards the basic study of arbovirus infection of mosquitoes to provide a much sounder scientific basis. Firstly, several sets of samples of Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles were obtained by means of simultaneous light-trap catch, hand catch and CO_2-baited trap catch, and the infection rates of Japanese encephalitis virus were compared among the samples. As the results, it was found that the infection rates were generally higher in the hand-catch samples than in the light-trap samples. Secondly, blood-engorged females of Anopheles hyrcanus complex were collected at a pig shed when Japanese encephalitis epizootic was prevalent among swine, and repeated attempts were made to verify the possibility of isolation of Japanese encephalitis virus from ingested blood rather than tissues in those mosquitoes. Ultimately, the attempts yielded two isolates of the virus which conceivably came not from the infected mosquito tissues but from the ingested blood.

N2  - Extensive surveys were undertaken in Western Samoa during the period 1969 to 1971 on breeding habits of the confirmed and suspected vectors of subperiodic Wuchereria banorofti and of Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti, the vector of dengue fever. Ae. (S.) aegypti breeds predominantly in artificial water containers around houses. A negligible number was found breeding in tree holes. This mosquito occurs throughout the country, even in the remote and inland areas. Ae. (S.) polynesiensis breeds in a wide range of both artificial and natural containers, but seems to prefer the latter, and is the only species breeding in crab holes. Since the above two species are often found breeding together, the single-larva-per-container survey method tends to underestimate the population of either one. Ae. (S.) upolensis is a forest mosquito, and its larvae were collected only once in a tree hole. The only species found breeding in the leaf axils of Freycinetia is Ae. (Finlaya) samoanus; and in taro (Colocasia sp.) and pineapples, Ae. (F.) oceanicus. Both species can also breed in the Pandanus axils. This plant serves the only breeding habitat for Ae. (F.) tutuilae.

N2  - The studies were made on the mode of breeding and of hypopus formation of Lardoglyphus konoi (Sasa and Asanuma, 1951) in various kinds of diet. Two groups of diet prepared are as follows : Diet group A was based on the mixture of same weight of fish powder and yeast powder (control diet) with additional process. Some of them were added with 5% weight of soy bean oil. Diet group B was the mixture of yeast powder and one of the various kinds substances. Approximately 1,300 mites were inoculated on 20g of the diet and they were kept at 25℃ and 85% R.H. (regulated with KCl saturated solution). Number of mites in 0.5g of diet and number of mites escaped from the container were counted every week. The appearance rate of hypopus in the diet and in the escaped population were observed. The period of observations was separated into following 3 stages : 1st stage was from 1st to 3rd week, 2nd stage from 4th to 7th week, and 3rd stage from 8th to 10th week. Number of mites in Table 2 is the mean number per week in every stage. 1) The mode of breeding of L. konoi in A group diet. When soy bean oil was added in the diet at 5%, number of mites in these diets and of escaped mites rose up in the beginning of the experiment. Considering the nutritional contents of the diets may be classified in three types as follows : (1) fat abundant type; When the fat and other nutriments were contained enough in the diet, the mites counts were high even in the 1st stage and the peak of number of the mites was revealed in the 6th week and later population density of the mites decreased rapidly. This was the type that increasing speed of the mites population was high in initial period (for example, diet (1), (2), (4), (8) and (10)). (2) fat deficient type; when the fat was deficient but other nutriments were abundant in the diet, population density of the mites was low in the 1st stage. It ascended rapidly in the 2nd stage and was slowly down in the 3rd stage. This type was that the increasing speed of the mites population density was slow in the 1st stage (for example, diet (3) and (7)). (3) nutrient deficient type; when the nutriments were deficient in the diet, number of the mites was the highest in the 1st stage and decreased thereafter (for example, diet (5), (6), (11) and (12)). It was noticed that hypopus rates were higher in the nutrient deficient diets than in other diet of A group. In fish powder diet hypopus rate was the minimum in this study. 2) The mode of breeding and hypopus rate of L. konoi in the diet of B group. The maximum count of the mites was observed in the diet that whale meat extract was added to yeast powder at 5%. But in this diet, hypopus rate was low as well as in control. In the mixture of yeast powder and soy bean powder, milk casein, geratin or egg alubumin, population densities of the mites were lower than in yeast powder only. This fact may indicate that the various kinds of protein, added in yeast powder, were worse than yeast powder as a nutriment for the mites. The hypopus rate in these diets were higher than it in control diet or yeast powder. By the fact that increase of mite number was low in these diet, hypopus rate possibly increase due to deficiency of protein or unfit protein as a diet. Paticularly the mite density in soy bean powder was low, while the ratio of hypopus in that population was the highest.

N2  - In 1975 and 1976,a brief mosquito survey was carried out in Ishigakijima, the southern Ryukyus. Human- and dry ice-baited net-traps, unbaited net-trap and larval dipping were employed as collecting methods. The results were as follows : 1. Ten 5-hour nocturnal and six 2-hour daytime human-baited net catches were made during April, July and August 1976 and a total of 549 females consisting of 22 species was taken. In an urban area, Arakawa, the predominant species in the nocturnal catches were Cx. p. fatigans and Ar. subalbatus, together making up 91% of the total catch. In a mountain village, Hoshino C, Cx. p. fatigans was also predominant, forming 49% of the total catch. Ae. vexans nipponii and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus were the other common mosquitoes. In a forest area, Hoshino A and Noromizu, the species collected by nocturnal catches in considerable numbers were Ma. uniformis, Cx. bitaeniorhynchus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. pseudovishnui, Cq. crassipes and Ar. subalbatus. The predominant species in the daytime catches were Ae. riversi and Tr. bambusa. 2. One 5-hour nocturnal dry ice- and cowbaited net-trap catches were made at Hoshino A on April and July 1976,and a total of 113 and 950 female mosquitoes was collected respectively. The major mosquitoes were Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Ma. uniformis, Cx. pseudovishnui, Ae. v. nipponii, Cq. crassipes, Mi. luzonensis and Cx. bitaeniorhynchus. 3. Seven 12-hour nocturnal unbaited net-trap catches were also tried at Hoshino A, on July and August. A total of 30 mosquitoes consisting of 10 species of 5 genera were found in the traps. They were small numbers of Ae. riversi, Ur. ohamai, Ur. macfarlanei, Cx. bitaeniorhynchus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. tuberis, Cx. fuscocephala, Cq. crassipes and Mi. elegans. 4. From April 1975 to August 1976,85 light-trap collections were made at four different areas and a total of 2,185 mosquitoes representing 20 species of 7 genera was taken. There was a marked difference between predominant mosquito species taken in the urban area, Misaki, and the forest and irrigated areas, Noromizu, Kabira and Nagura. On the urban area, 90% of the total catch was Cx. p. fatigans, while on the forest and irrigated areas, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (29% of the total catch in the areas), Cx. pseudovishnui (29%), Ma. uniformis (10%), Ae. v. nipponii (6.0%) and Mi. luzonensis (6.0%) were predominant species.

These new asymmetrical phosphorothiolothionates and thiolates having S-n-propyl showed exceptionally higher activity against both susceptible and resistant house flies than the corresponding analogues having other alkyl moieties. Usually low mammalian toxicity was demonstrated by the O-ethyl S-n-propyl O-substituted phenyl phosphoro-thiolothionates. Considering mammalian toxicity and insecticidal activity, prothiophos and its oxygen analogue are the preferred compounds as novel hygienic insecticides in the series.

N2  - Male Culex pipiens fatigans were sterilized with thiotepa and released at a rate of 150,000-300,000 per day for five-and-a-half months into a village near Delhi around which a zone, 3km wide, was maintained free of adult C.p. fatigans production by the application of larvicides. The mosquitos for release were marked and the ratio of marked (sterile) to unmarked (wild) males was always greater than 24 : 1. In view of the known level of mating competitiveness of the sterile males a very high proportion of the matings in the village were expected to be by sterile males. Data from egg rafts collected from captured unmarked (wild) females proved that a high level of sterility was introduced into the wild population, for a period of about three weeks, but in the preceding and succeeding months the level of sterility was low. Evidence from several sources indicated that, despite the surrounding breeding-free zone, fertile inseminated females were infiltrating into the experimental village. Comparison of the density of the wild population in the experimental village with two untreated villages suggested that the period of high sterility might have caused some degree of temporary population reduction, but the evidence was not conclusive.

N2  - The seeds of 14 species, belonging to Cruciferae family, which are commonly available in Japan, were observed for the exudation of mucilage in water and for the ability of trapping and killing Aedes albopictus larvae. The seeds of two cultured Cruciferae, Brassica campestris rapifera L. cv. Yorii-kabu in Japanese, and B. c. oleifera L. cv. Natane, as well as seeds of uncultured Cardamine scutata Thund. and Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) were proved to produce the mucilaginous layer and to trap and kill the larvae. Thirty-two heat-killed seeds of the above four species were soaked in the water together with mosquito larvae. The percentage of larvae attached in 24 hours were 39,47,70 and 49%, respectively. The mortality of these larvae in three days were 70,60,77 and 65%, respectively. Various numbers of seeds of C. scutata were soaked together with 100 larvae for three days. It has been shown that the mortality increased as the number of seeds soaked were increased.

N2  - In order to maintain securely many laboratory strains of mosquitoes, a simple mosquito rearing cage "Connection cage, " in which all the required manipulations could be carried out without ever opening the cage, was designed. The connection cage (25×31×28cm) consists of 3 main parts, the upper cage for rearing of adults, the lower vessel for rearing of larvae and the connection frame connecting the upper cage and the lower vessel. In our laboratory, the cage has been successfully used for over a year in maintaining colonies of Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Aedes flavopictus Yamada, Aedes riversi Bohart and Ingram, Aedes togoi (Theobald), Aedes aureostriatus okinawanus Bohart, Culex pipiens fatigans Wiedemann, Culex infantulus Edwards and Tripteroides bambusa (Yamada).

N2  - An epidemiological survey by questionnaire was made on arachnidism caused by the spider, Chiracanthium japonicum, in Japan. Among 42 arachnologists and 79 medical doctors, who are interested in arachnidism, 90 researchers submitted clinical records of bite cases in response to the questionnaire. A total of 28 patients of arachnidism was reported from different prefectures including Hokkaido, Aomori, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi, Gumma, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Aichi, Wakayama, Mie, Nagasaki and Saga. Analysis of these 28 cases was made in which the sex of causative spiders, seasonal frequency, age and sex distribution of patients, location bitten, site of bites, severity and duration of time suffered were examined. From this epidemiological analysis, arachnidism caused by Chiracanthium japonicum was summarized as follows : A) The arachnidism occurred very commonly in Japan during a period of four months from May to August, with a peak in June. B) During the mating season the male spiders searching for mates accidentally infest human hibitats and inflict their bites most commonly during the midnight hour while the humans are sleeping. C) The site of bites was most frequently observed in the upper extremities. D) A drastic difference is observed in arachnidism caused by male versus female spiders. Male spiders produce sharp pain at the bite while the female causes intensive itching. However, both sexes produce redness over the skin lesion.

N2  - Anisogammarus sp. collected from a mountain stream had been kept in respective conditions of different temperature from 5℃ to 20℃ over a period of 24 hours for the acclimatization. Toxicity test of Temephos was conducted at 5,10,15℃ and 20℃. In each beaker of 200ml containing 100ml of water, individuals of adult Anisogammarus sp. were placed. Temephos which was diluted with alcohol was added to become 1,5ppm and 10ppm respectively. Exposure period to the chemical was 10,30,60 minutes and 180 minutes. After respective exposure period, animals were transferred into clean water and mortality was observed 24 hours later in the rooms of the respective conditions of temperature. Three replicates were taken for each experimental condition. Toxicity of Temephos depended on the water temperature. In the case of 1ppm, the mortality of Anisogammarus sp. changed two times or more in accordance with the change of temperature from 10℃ to 20℃. Mortality of the animals also depended on the exposure period of the chemical. The relationship between the logexposure period and the mortality was linear in general in each concentration. The slope of the regression changed according to the temperature in the case of 5ppm, whereas the regression lines converged in the case of 10ppm. It was thought from the results that Anisogammarus sp. would not be damaged in the field if the concentration of Temephos was 1ppm and the exposure period was less than one hour.

N2  - The field tests for control of Culex pipiens pallens bred in the drainage ditches by methoprene were conducted in Neyagawa City, Osaka Prefecture. Two trials were carried out. The first trial was in June, where it was rainy season, and there was continuous water flow in the drains. When sand granule form of methoprene was applied at 1ppm to such drainage ditches, the adult emergence of C. pipiens pallens was completely inhibited for the first 5 days, thereafter, the partial inhibition (more than 50% inhibition) of adult emergence lasted for 53 days. The second trial was carried out in August. At this time, the rainy season was over, and the water in the drainage ditches was in the stational condition. The inhibitory effect of sand granule form at the same dose lasted longer, up to 72 days after treatment. Whereas, one treatment with briquet form of methoprene, when applied at 1ppm, gave virtually almost complete inhibition of adult emergence for 30 days.

N2  - A new type of pyrethroid compounds which possessed a linear type chemical structure in the alcoholic moiety was synthesized, and the lethal and knockdown activities of the compounds were studied. As the result, SP-3243 (1-ethynyl-2-methyl-2-hexen-5-yn-1-yl 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate) was found to possess the highest efficacy among these compounds against houseflies, mosquitoes and cockroaches. The lethal activity of this compound against houseflies was more than 10 times higher than that of pyrethrins and allethrin. The knockdown activity of this compound against houseflies and mosquitoes was slightly inferior to that of pyrethrins, nevertheless, the efficacy of aerosol formulation was high enough. This compound also possessed insecticidal activity against cockroaches, but the efficacy was inferior to that of pyrethrins and permethrin.

N2  - Comparative effects of nine substituted phenyl N-methylcarbamates on German cockroach, Blattella germanica, were studied in laboratory conditions. The topical (LD)_<50> values were determined using female cockroaches, and propoxur was found to be the most toxic. In rapidity of knockdown of the cockroaches tested by the plywood contact method, propoxur was excellent. The (KT)_<50> after the limited time contact with the residues on plywoods was the shortest in Meobal, and propoxur was the next. The residual effect of propoxur estimated from the (KT)_<50> values at 28℃ in 1 week and 3 weeks after treatment was also excellent. Summarizing the data obtained here, propoxur has proved to be a very promising insecticide to control German cockroach, and the other carbamates were far inferior to propoxur.

N2  - A small wild cockroach, Chorisoneura nigra Shiraki, hitherto treated as Lupparia nigra by Shiraki, is redescribed and illustrated (Fig. 1-3,6,7,9-15). This name was first given to Taiwanese individuals, but it is also applicable to Japanese specimens found in Kyushu, Shikoku and Western Honshu. It may be worth to mention that this cockroach species has never been found from any island of the Ryukyu island-arc. A Chinese species, Ch. setshuana Bey-Bienko (1958) (Fig. 18) seems to be very close to our nigra Shiraki (1908). In southwest Japan Ch. nigra is usually taken from the branches or leaves of orange or pine trees. A pale coloured Taiwanese congener, once misidentified as "Ch. flavoantennata" was revised based on the type-specimen and additional fresh material (Fig. 4,5,16,17) taken exclusively from South Taiwan. This species seems to be allied to Ch. lativitrea (Walker) of Southeast Asia (Fig. 19).

N2  - A mosquito survey was carried out from 1975 to 1977 to clarify the breeding status of Anopheles, especially a well-known malaria vector, Anopheles minimus minimus Theobald, in Ishigakijima and Iriomotejima, the southern Ryukyus. Larval dipping at streams, and adult catches by a lighttrap, and human-, cow- and dry ice-baited net-traps at different localities were the collecting methods employed. In the present survey, An. m. minimus Theobald, An. saperoi Bohart and Ingram (=An. ohamai Ohama), An. sinensis Wied. (including An. lesteri Baisas and Ho) and An. tessellatus Theobald were collected. An. m. minimus were commonly found, i.e., 1,390 larvae and pupae in total, or 1.84 per dip and 49,or 0.41 per dip in streams of foot-hill areas of Ishigakijima and Iriomotejima, respectively. At the urban area in Ishigakijima, no adult of An. m. minimus and only 8 An. sinensis were collected by light-traps made on 76 nights in the year 1976. On the other hand, at the foot of mountains and paddy regions in both Islands, many adults were collected by light-traps on 26 nights. They consisted of 379 An. sinensis, 37 An. m. minimus and 1 An. tessellatus. An. m. minimus was not only highly anthropophilic but also seemed to be zoophilic. It was most commonly collected by human-baited net-traps on 12 nights (101 females or 92% out of the total 110), and also frequently by cow-baited net-traps on 2 nights (116 females or 32% out of the total 363). An. sinensis was highly zoophilic, as shown by the fact that it was common in cow-baited net-traps. It is particularly noticeable that 18 females of An. m. minimus were attracted to human-baited net-traps near human dwellings in Hoshino village on 2 nights in July 1976. The parous rate of these females was comparatively high, being 25% out of 44 dissected. Such recent increase in number of An. m. minimus seems to have been caused mainly by the increase of the population of cows, the main host animal of the mosquito, and also by the reduction in the degree of pollution in the water of breeding streams.

Among six groups of the black flies preserved at 20℃ and 25℃, the longest survival was 25 days in the group which was kept at 20℃ on the sugar meal from a wad of cotton soaked once in 0.5% sugar solution and strongly squeezed. Whereas, the highest average longevity was 14.9 days in the group kept at 20℃ on a wad of cotton similarly prepared but in saturated sugar solution. These meals were replaced about every week.

N2  - It has been observed that there was no growth of fungi in the diet of grain mites and fungi grew when the mites had died. Kuwahara et al. (1975) and Kuwahara (1976) found two kinds of alarm pheromones, Citral and Neryl formate in the grain mites. In order to search the ecological role of the alarm pheromone, antifungal effect of the pheromone was investigated. Three methods, the cup method, the gas method and the modified gas method were employed to observe the antifungal effect of Citral and the hexane extract of Carpoglyphus lactis on Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp. fumi.). The results were as follows : The cup method : A metal cup (φ8mm×10mm) containing Citral was placed in the center of the medium plate inoculated with Asp. fumi. over the whole surface. The antifungal effect of Citral was evaluated as the diameter of the zone of inhibition. As there was no correlation between the diamete of the zone of inhibition and the logarithm of concentration of Citral, it was supposed that the antifungal effect of Citral was due to the evaporated Citral gas. "The gas method" : In order to make it clear whether Citral was effective in evaporated gas or not, the gas method was applied. Asp. fumi. was inoculated over the whole surface of the medium in the petri dish. This petri dish was turned up side down and a paper disc im pregnated with 0.04ml of Citral hexane solution was placed in the center of the lid of the petri dish. The growth of Asp. fumi. was inhibited and the antifungal effect of Citral was due to fungistatic action of the evaporated gas. "The modified gas method" : In order to indicate the antifungal effect of lower concentration of Citral quantitatively, "the modified gas method" was applied. Asp. fumi. was inoculated in the center of the medium plate as a pin point. This petri dish was turned up side down and the paper disc with Citral hexane solution was placed in the center of the lid. The degree of the fungal growth was observed as the diameter of the colony. This method may be utilized for the bioassay of volatile substances. For example, 1ml hexane extract of C. lactis 20g wet weight of mites had the same potency of antifungal effect as 4.8mg/ml of Citral. The phenomenon that some grain mites eat fungi may be one of the reasons that fungi can not grow in the diet with many number of grain mites, but the antifungal effect of the alarm pheromone, Citral, in the grain mites may play the role, too.

N2  - The Japanese pipistrelle, Pipistrellus abramus (Temminck, 1840), usually roosts in human houses in Japan and has been commonly known as the house bat. Due probably to an increase of the local populations of this bat around the Tokai district for the last few years, some of the inhabitants became nervous to the bats that roosted in the ceiling, shutter-box, garret, crevice of the wainscot, or under the floor of their houses. Some of these people complained of squeaking noises of the bats at night, of the filth and carcasses occasionally found in the neighborhood of the houses. Certain circles, moreover, became apprehensive of the occurrence of arthropod-bites or communicable diseases that might be transmitted by these bats. Therefore, we investigated the inhabitants who had made appeals as described above, but we did not confirm any serious symptoms. At present we regard this bat as one of the so-called "nuisances." However, our examination of arthropods on these bats and in the dust or dirt collected at their roosting sites revealed at least 20 acarine and four insect species (Table 1). Of these, a species of soft ticks, Argas vespertilionis (Latreille), has been well known to bite man; and a mesostigmatid, Steatonyssus longispinosus Wang, can be responsible for dermatitis cases of undetermined origin.

N2  - An investigation was made on ectoparasites, particularly on mites, of the pet animals suffered from dermatitis at the Veterinary Hospital of Azabu Veterinary College (Kanagawa district) and the Japan Animal Medical Center (Tokyo district) from October, 1975,to December, 1976. Eight species of mites were obtained from dogs, three from cats, one from rabbits, and two from birds. The mites detected are arranged in order of frequency, as follows : From dogs, Otodectes cynotis (Hering, 1838), Demodex canis Leydig, 1859,Cheyletiella yasguri Smiley, 1965,Haemaphysalis flava Neumann, 1897,Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Shrank, 1781), Sarcoptes scabiei Gerlach, 1857,Ornithonyssus bacoti (Hirst, 1913), and Helenicula miyagawai Sasa et al., 1951; from cats, Otodectes cynotis (Hering, 1838), Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Shrank, 1781), and Notoedres cati (Hering, 1838); from rabbits, Psoroptes cuniculi (Delafond, 1859); and from birds, Dermanyssus gallinae De Geer, 1778,and Cnemidocoptes pilae Lavoipierre and Griffiths, 1951. Of these species of mite the following five were suspected to infest the owners of the animals; these are C. yasguri, S. scabiei, O. bacoti, H. miyagawai, and N. cati. It was uncertain, however, whether they attacked the owners actually, because diagnosis was made not by detection of the same species of mite from the owners but by their notice of those of the pet animals.

N2  - Chemical control of Chironomid larvae was investigated in the two different rivers, Zenpukuji and Nogawa, of Tokyo. The River Zenpukuji with a moderate current was treated with temephos W. P. for 60min at 1ppm. Seven days after the treatment, larval population was reduced by 80% in the area from the treatment spot to the 500-meter point downstream, and by less than 70% at the 900-meter point downstream. However, number of the 1st-instar larvae resurged 10 days after treatment. The River Nogawa (Koganei City, Tokyo) was treated with temephos W. P. for 60min at 1ppm. Four days after the treatment, there was no larval population of midge in the area from the treated spot to the 3,100-meter point downstream, but young instar larvae resurged 8 days after the treatment. One month after the treatment, the larval population was larger than the pre-treatment period. The second test in the same river with 0.68-ppm treatment for 60min resulted in inferior control, which is considered to be attributable to the differences in chemical concentration and to the low temperature (24℃ vs. 19℃). Within several hours after the treatment, a great number of the larvae and pupae were carried away, and most of them were found dead. All the larvae intoxicated were observed to die in 72hrs under the laboratory conditions. However, some portion of the larvae which survived in mud tubes after the treatment, emerged into adults.

N2  - A new genus, Tokunagayusurika, is created in the subfamily Orthocladiinae, with Orthocladius akamusi (Tokunaga, 1938) as a monotypic member. This species is quite unique both in morphology and biology as a chironomid. The body size is much larger than other members of the subfamily, and is almost as large as the giant midge, Chironomus plumosus (L.). The larvae are blood red in color, and are found in the bottom mud of eutrophicated lakes. The adults emerge once a year in late autumn. The structure of male genitalia, especially the shape of the style, is highly complicated and does not fit to any of the known genera. The adults are also unusual in that they lack in the comb on the apex of hind tibia. Morphological characters of pupae and larvae are newly described. This species is considered as to be playing a significant role in fixing and removing organic nutrients from eutrophicated lakes, but causes a serious nuisance during the season of its emergence.

N2  - The resistance level of the 15 strains of houseflies collected from the Philippines were examined against 6 insecticides, DDT, pyrethrins, malathion, fenitrothion, fenthion, and dichlorvos. Most colonies showed higher susceptibility against these insecticides than the Takatsuki strain, especially to DDT. The LD_<50> values of malathion were between 0.0975μg per fly. Among the 15 strains, 7 showed higher LD_<50> values against malathion than the Takatsuki strain. These results mean that the houseflies in the Philippines are increasing their resistance against malathion.

N2  - Using light trap (black light), night catches of some Japanese black flies were made in southern part of Kyushu, Japan, during the years 1975-1977. Light traps were set and operated weekly or daily for varying periods at different places : A-cowshed in mountainous area, E-dwelling house in a sparsely populated district in the city, both places being 2km from the nearest breeding sites, B-cowshed in a pasture infested with bovine Onchocerciasis in a mountainous area, C-pigsty in a rural area, and D-poultry farm in the suburbs of the city, where two to six species of simuliids were found breeding in streams within 500m from the trapping sites. In the cowshed (A), of which the structure of the wall prevented the light of trap from escaping outwards, a total of 268 females belonging to 6 species were collected during three years from 1975-1977. The 268 females included 143 Simulium (Simulium) japonicum, 57 S. (Odagmia) aokii, 29 S. (S.) arakawae, 21 S. (S.) rufibasis, 15 S. (Gnus) bidentatum and 3 S. (S.) quinquestriatum. All species contained blood-fed females in different ratios from 23.8 to 46.7% of the total, but neither gravid female nor male individual. In another cowshed (B), which was roughly built, lacking walls on south and north sides, thus permitted the light of the trap to extend outwards to a considerable distance from the cowshed, a total of 108 adults were captured by 10 trappings from June to September 1977. Species and the number of flies trapped were S. (S.) japonicum 84,S. (S.) arakawae 11,S. (Eusimulium) uchidai 5,S. (G.) bidentatum 4,S. (S.) rufibasis 3 and S. (S.) quinquestriatum 1. Of these, 10 S. (S.) japonicum, 2 S. (S.) arakawae, 2 S. (G.) bidentatum and 1 S. (E.) uchidai were males. And, of 93 females captured, 22-100% of blood-fed females were found in S. (S.) japonicum, S. (S.) arakawae, S. (S.) rufibasis and S. (G.) bidentatum, and 23-100% of gravid females in all species except for S. (G.) bidentatum. In the pigsty (C), 10 trappings between February and June 1975,yielded 10 black flies consisting of 3 S. (E.) uchidai, 2 S. (E.) aureohirtum, 2 S. (S.) arakawae, 1 S. (G.) bidentatum, 1 S. (S.) japonicum and 1 S. (S.) nikkoense. Two of these were male individuals, belonging one to S. (E.) uchidai and one to S. (G.) bidentatum. One of 2 S. (S.) arakawae was engorged with blood. A single blood-fed female of S. (E.) uchidai was trapped in the poultry (C) by 34 weekly night collections from April to October 1977,and also one unfed female of S. (S.) arakawae in the dwelling house (E) by 115 light trappings from September 1976 to August 1977. From these results, some ecological aspects of adult black flies in southern part of Kyushu were revealed as follows : 1) Females of S. (O.) aokii, S. (G.) bidentatum, S. (S.) arakawae, S. (S.) japonicum, S. (S.) rufibasis and S. (S.) quinquestriatum fly to the cowshed at least 2km from their breeding sites, presumably feed on cattle, even at night and then fly away sooner or later before they become gravid. 2) A light trap operated near breeding places captured males as well as females of the same species as found by the previous collections of the immature stages, suggesting that flight range of male individuals of some black flies is confined to the area not far from their habitats. 3) The seasonal span of both S. (S.) japonicum and S. (S.) arakawae in the trap in the cowshed (A) was from the middle of May to the beginning of November and that of S. (O.) aokii and S. (S.) rufibasis from the middle of May to the late of August. 4) A marked decrease in the number of females per night trapped in the cowshed (A) between 1975 and 1977 was considered mainly due to the construction work of the new highway which destroyed many breeding places for the aquatic stage of black flies. 5) S. (S.) japonicum was supposed to be a vector of Onchocerca gutturosa, a parasite of bovine Onchocerciasis prevailing in the pasture (B).

N2  - The effects of waters conditioned by the egg rafts or the larvae of Culex pipiens molestus and C. tritaeniorhynchus summorosus on their intraspecific oviposition preference were investigated. Preference was shown to the water on which egg rafts of the same species had been floated for one day at 20℃ over tap water in C. p. molestus, but not in C. tritaeniorhynchus. When the number of egg rafts was over ten in water conditioning, the oviposition females of C. p. molestus discriminated between the conditioned water and tap water. C. tritaeniorhynchus was reluctant to choose the water which had contained the 1st-instar larvae for only one hour at 25℃, but this effect was trivial with the water in which the 4th-instar larvae had been held. However, the oviposition females of C. p. molestus showed a significant preference to the water which had contained the over thirty 4th-instar larvae in 200ml for one hour at 25℃. Even if two 4th-instar larvae had been contained per pot for one day, but not one hour, the water was selected by C. p. molestus. However, no clear discrimination was made by C. p. molestus between tap water and the water which had contained the 1st-instar larvae for one hour at 25℃. The water in which larvae were reared from the 1st-instar to pupation at 25℃ was preferred for oviposition over tap water in both species. This difference in the experimental results for C. tritaeniorhynchus may be attributed to the food present in the microbiota rich, larvae-rearing water. The interpretation of these results was made in connection with the larval adaptability to the density and the ecological characteristics of larval habitat in each species.

N2  - The effects of temperature on the development of larval and pupal stages, the interspecies competition in larvae, and the effects of temperature on the fecundity of three species of fleshflies, B. peregrina, P. similis and P. crassipalpis, were studied under the laboratory conditions. The larvae were reared on minced beef, and adults were fed on milk and 2% sucrose solution. Minced beef was given as a larviposition medium. The results were obtained as follows : 1. The length of larval stage was shorter than that of pupal stage in all species. The length of development from the larva to adult emergence, was shortest in P. similis, followed by B. peregrina and P. crassipalpis. 2. The calculated developmental zero points and accumulated thermal constants of the larval and pupal stages in three species are shown in Table 2. 3. The notable differences of the body weight of these pupae were observed when the larvae were reared under 20℃. The pupal weight of P. crassipalpis was about two times as that of B. peregrina. 4. Two species were introduced into the breeding medium at different rates, and three combinations of flies were set up to interact. The competition was estimated from the difference of percents of adult emergence between two species. With the increased number of B. peregrina, the percent of adult emergence of P. similis decreased. Similarly, with the increased number of P. similis, the percent of adult emergence of P. crassipalpis decreased. 5. The favourable temperatures for fecundity lay at 25℃ in B. peregrina, between 20 and 30℃ in P. similis, and between 25 and 30℃ in P. crassipalpis, B. peregrina proved to be superior in the reproduction, capacity to the other two species.

N2  - The epidemiological study was made on the cases of black fly bites in the campus of a certain college of Kanagawa prefecture during the period from February 1976 to January 1977,where many students had been suffered from various skin lesions by black fly bites and six kinds of black flies including the dominant species of Simulium aokii were identified from the nearby stream. The patients of 85 individuals were recorded among 200 students in total during one year survey. Black fly bites were observed in all seasons, but most of the bites occurred in three months from May to July. Most of the bites were inflicted around sunrise or sunset, especially from 3 to 5 p.m. Most of the bites occurred in the fields such as the farm or the lawn around the campus but a few cases were recognized indoor such as the green house or the passage of the school building. The sites of bites were present mainly at the upper or lower extremities. Many lesions and accompanying manifestations produced by black fly bites were recognized. Redness as primary lesions was classified into four types : erythema, point-sharp erythema, erythema nodosum and urticarial rash. These reactions occurred within 15min in most cases but the occurrence of 24hrs later was also observed. While, erythema nodosum and urticarial rash developed into secondary lesions including eczematous purulence or necrosis. In this study, severe cases including fever, nausea, headache, lymphnode swelling or general malaise were recognized. Their manifestations may suggest the participation of allergic reaction for the toxin of black flies. The duration of the scar of black fly bites was common in 4 or 5 days, but also in one year or so.

N2  - Arachnidism caused by the genus Chiracanthium has been reported from subtropical or warm temperate zones in all over the world. So far in Japan, total 50 cases of arachnidism caused by C. japonicum, which is recognized to be most dangerous, were recorded and analized epidemiologically from the medical points of view up to 1976. The investigation was made on the function and the histology of the venom apparatus for the purpose of analysing the cause of arachnidism. The venom apparatus is associated with the chelicerae or first pair of appendages of the cephalothorax. Each consists of a large basal segment and a terminal claw-like fang piecerced by the duct from the venom gland. The fang of male is about two times longer than that of female, therefore, the fangs of male was found to be able to penetrate the palmar skin of volunteer more deeper than that of female. The muscularis was found to cover the whole gland beginning from the neck of the gland. This is the bundle of fibers of striated-muscle. The basement membrane from a continuous layer under the muscularis. The two kinds of epithelial cells were observed lining the basement membrane. The first layer is formed by small and low cells with an ovarial nucleus. The second layer is formed by high columnar cells attaching on the basement membrane. Both the nuclei of the first and the second cells show the same morphological structure by the optical microscopy.

N2  - Endoparasitic mites on anatid birds were investigated. The survey was carried out in Shinhama, Chiba prefecture and in Koshigaya, Saitama prefecture during the period from November, 1967 to February, 1968. The total of 489 anatid birds consisted of 6 species were examined. 1) Two species of nasal mites, which have not been reported in Japan, were collected from the anatid birds. These were Rhinonyssus rhinolethrum (Trouessart, 1895) and Trispeleognathus womersleyi (Fain, 1955). 2) The six species of host birds examined were pintail, Anas acuta acuta Linne, 1758; teal, Anas crecca crecca Linne, 1758; wigeon, Anas penelope Linne, 1758; shoveller, Anas clypeata Linne, 1758; spot-billed duck, Anas poecilorhyncha zonorhyncha Swinhoe, 1866 and mallard, Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos, Linne, 1758. In addition, domestic ducks were examined in the two different places of the survey. 3) Rhinonyssus rhinolethrum was collected from 169 birds of 489 examined (34.6% of infestation rate), which were distributed to all 6 species in the survey. The infestation rate of wigeon by this mite was highest (73.5%). These of pintail, teal, shoveller, spot-billed duck, and mallard were 40.5%, 20.6%, 17.6%, 11.1% and 2.2% respectively. Trispeleognathus womersleyi was collected only from pintail and mallard. Their infestation rates were 16.4% and 4.4% respectively. 4) Majority of pintail and wigeon were found to be infested by less than 5 mites of Rhinonyssus rhinolethrum or Trispeleognathus womersleyi if infested. 5) Of the 171 domestic ducks examined, 84 were used as decoy birds, among which 8 were found to be infested by nasal mites. The rest of the domestic ducks were found not to be infested by them.

N2  - Atylotus hasegawai, a new species, was described on the basis of adult and larval materials collected from Tohoku Province of Honshu Island, Japan. This species is quite allied to A. horvathi (Szilady) and A. bivittateinus Takahasi. Although it is very difficult to distinguish these three allied species by a single morphological character, the bilogy of the present species is quite different from the other two. Main morphological differences among them are discussed in this paper.

N2  - The mosquito fish, Cambusia affinis (Baird and Girard) was introduced into Tokushima city in 1968 to control mosquito larvae in the salt marsh and the drains. Thereafter the fish propagated and spread into the wide area of the city. In the present study, it was clarified how extent they were distributing in the city area after 8 years since the introduction. The distribution of G. affinis in the winter season were limited. During several years following the introduction, the fish were spread by the members of laboratory. However it was confirmed by the present study that the fish spread themselves from the focus of the distribution to the surrounding areas during the spring and summer time. In the autumn of 1975,G. affinis distributed approximate 70 percent of the water bodies, whereas, larvae of Culex pipiens pallens distributed in the limited places. The effectiveness of G. affinis on the control of mosquito larvae was studied by releasing the fish into the drains where only Culex pipiens pallens larvae were inhabiting. After average 250 individuals of G. affinis per drain of approximately 2m×80m were released, the number of mosquito larvae decreased at 7 drains out 9. The fish settled in the these places and could be observed till four months later when the experiment was ended. The effectiveness of G. affinis on the mosquito control was studied also by examining the number of adult mosquitoes. Light traps were set up at the G. affinis densely inhabited area and the no G. affinis area. Comparison of the number of mosquito between the two areas indicated no significant difference. Mosquitoes seemed to be not abundant even in the area where no G. affinis inhabited in the present study.

N2  - Preliminary studies on the interval between two successive blood meals of Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis, the main vector of subperiodic bancroftian filariasis in the South Pacific, were undertaken by two methods : one, by mark-and-release experiments in Fiji, and the other, by the size of developing filarial larvae in the mosquitos from Tuvalu. The results obtained by both methods were similar, and the average blood meal interval in the field was estimated to be three or four days under the temperature range 25-31℃. The latter method is considered to be useful for estimation of blood meal interval of vector mosquitos in endemic areas of filariasis.

N2  - Venom was extracted from venomous spicules of the Oriental tussock moth caterpillar, Euproctis subflava, and its pharmacological and biochemical properties were investigated. 1. Pharmacological activities such as positive skin reaction in man, increase in vascular permeability and contraction of smooth muscle of the isolated guinea pig ileum, and deformation of goat erythrocytes (EDA) were demonstrated in the venom extracted with PBS (pH 7.2). 2. The crude venom was separated into two, high molecular (HM) and low molecular (LM) fractions, by a single hollow fiber concentrator with a cut-off molecular weight of 15,000. Thin-layer and paper chromatographies revealed the presence of histamine in the LM fraction as identified by close agreement in Rf values and developed colors. 3. HM and LM fractions were further fractionated by column chromatography on Sephadex G-100 or G-50,respectively. HM fraction was separated into 4 (HM-I-IV) fractions : HM-I, which was eluted in the void volume, showed EDA. HM-II and III were proved to contain potent proteolytic (casein as substrate) and esterolytic (tosyl-arginine methylester, TAME as substrate) activities, respectively. Kinin-producing activity was also found in HM-III. Furthermore, ileum contraction activity was demonstrated in HM-II-III and IV, and all of the 4 fractions were positive in skin reaction and caused increase in vascular permeability. 4. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the local reactions caused by the venomous spicules in the human skin are due to toxic substance(s) and/or enzyme(s) contained in the spicules rather than to mechanical injury.

N2  - Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the spines of the slug moth caterpillar, Parasa consocia had no opening at the pointed ends, differing from the results reported by many investigators based on light microscopic observations. Fine structure of the spicules and their sockets on the 8th and 9th dorsal segments of the last instar larva was also described. PBS extracts from the spines and spicules were fractionated by a single hollow fiber concentrator (SHFC). The inner fluid in SHFC, containing substances with molecular weights higher than 15,000 (HM) was further fractionated through a Sephadex G-100 column, while the outer fluid containing lower molecular substances (LM) was fractionated through a Sephadex G-50 column. 1. Injection of crude venom from the spines and spicules into the tail vein of mice made them squeak and bite at the injected area due probably to local pains, followed by crouching posture and shiver for a few hours. Paralysis was observed at their hind legs when injected with the venom subcutaneously. 2. Thin-layer chromatography revealed the presence of histamine in both the venoms from the spines and spicules. 3. HMs and LMs separated from the crude venoms of the spines and spicules exhibited positive skin reactions in man by scratch method : Erythema and edema or wheal were the common symptoms produced by all of these fractions tested. Severe recurrent pains were produced by the HMs a few minutes after application. The pains were relieved within several hours, but contact stimuli to the applied area of the skin produced the recurrent pains for a few days. Though the LM from the spine venom also showed pain-producing activity, it differed from the HMs in its rapid action and shorter duration. 4. Each of the HMs from the spine and spicule venoms was separated into 3 fractions (HM-I-III), by column chromatography : HM-Is had a wheal producing activity in the skin test. HM-IIs had activities to produce severe pain and to contract smooth muscle of the isolated guinea pig ileum. The contraction induced by the two HM-IIs differed from that by histamine in that the former took longer time before the onset and showed longer duration of the contraction after several washes with Tyrode's solution; it also differed from the contraction caused by bradykinin in that the former showed tachyphylaxis. Moreover, self-movement of the ileum was increased during or after the contraction and it continued till the intra-ileac contents were thoroughly ejected. Contraction activity of the spine HM-II might be due to two substances, HM-IIa and HM-IIb. Stimulating effect of the spine HM-II on the polymodal receptor of dog testis was kept longer than that of bradykinin. Vascular permeability in guinea pig skin was also increased by the spine HM-I-III. 5. The LM from the spines was found to contain two active substances; one was histamine and the other was protein or polypeptide (LM-I) with a molecular weight of several thousands. LM-I possessed activities such as pain-producing, ileum-contracting without tachyphylaxis, and vascular permeability-increasing. From these results, it was suggested that LM-I might be a kinin-like substance.

N2  - It is known that tumor-like lesions of the alimentary canal have been experimentally induced in cockroaches and locusts by nerve severance, duct ligation, decapitation, etc. The similar lesions have been known to occur spontaneously in less than 10 percent of these insects in nature. We have recently found the same kind of lesion in more than 80 percent of our laboratory colony of Periplaneta fuliginosa (Serville). The roaches bearing the lesion were abnormally distended or swollen in their abdomens filled with whitish fat bodies. At autopsy, this lesion was easily recognized as a white opaque mass against the normal brownish tissue. Histologically, tracheation and pigmented necrotic foci were seen in the lesion, and around it hundreds of hemocytes aggregated to give an appearance of tumor. The nuclei of the peripheral cells were located near the inner bound-aries, but no mitosis was observed. These figures suggest that the lesion is not of neoplasmic nature but a sort of repairing process of injury; we now regard it as a kind of ulcer. Field surveys conducted around Nagoya City in 1975-1976 revealed that the overall mean incidence of the lesion among the natural populations of P. fuliginosa was about 17 percent. But it differed by the collection sites, ranging from 3 to 65 percent. It did not noticeably change by the seasons of the year. However, the morbidity in the female (ca. 34%) was significantly higher than those in the male (ca. 13%) or larva (ca. 12.5%). Laboratory rearing of the cockroaches collected in nature seemed to increase their morbidity up to 90 percent or more, and the high morbidity resulted in high mortality with little exceptions. This tendency was more definitely shown when the roach was reared individually.

N2  - Affected by successive use of fenthion and dichlorvos houseflies inhabiting the third "Yumenoshima, " a dumping-island in Tokyo Bay have developed high multiresistance to organophosphorus compounds. In 1975-1977 maximum resistance ratios, R/S at LD50,were : fenthion, 428; dichlorvos, 79; fenitrothion, 2,224; diazinon, 1,042; malathion, 982. However, the cross-resistance to prothiophos was low with R/S 2 at LD50. The high OP pressure given in the field likely did not involve resistance to pyrethroids.

The artificial substrates used were nylon scrubbing brushes, short and long polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets, PVC tubes, fire bricks, normal bricks, and ceramic tiles. The number of simuliids captured by the PVC tubes was largest and that by the nylon scrubbing brushes was smallest. The hand collection were carried out by two collectors for five minutes each. In order to collect the immature stages of simuliid quantitatively, use of two methods, PVC tubes and five-minute collection are recommended.

N2  - Eight sampling methods of adult black flies were compared at Shuzenji, Shizuoka Prefecture. Of these methods, those which could obtain a good number of flies were sweeping with nets, sticky ribbon hanging close to a stream and light traps set at a cowshed. Sweeping with nets and sticky traps were suitable for collecting males. However, light traps were more effective for mass collection of female Simulium aokii and S. bidentatum, both the blood-fed and unfed. S. aokii showed its maximum activity from just after sunset to midnight, S. bidentatum, on the other hand, showed its maximum activity after midnight until one or two hours before sunrise.

N2  - Investigations were carried out on the fauna and distributions of black-flies in Kyushu in 1971-1974. A total of 2,072 pupae and 2,759 larvae were collected from 144 sites in 12 districts. Eighteen species and 1 subspecies were found, of which Simulium (Eusimulium) aureohirtum, S. (E.) sasai, S. (E.) subcostatum koshikiense, S. (E.) sp., S. (Gomphostilbia) ogatai and S. (Gnus) daisense were recorded for the first time from Kyushu. This brought the total number of Simuliidae in Kyushu to 25. The most abundant and widely distributed species are : S. (G.) bidentatum, S. (Simulium) arakawae, S. (Odagmia) aokii, S. (E.) uchidai, making up about 70% of the total number of specimens collected. Notes on geographical and vertical distributions of 19 taxa of black-flies in Kyushu were given.

N2  - The effectiveness of a new acute rodenticide, Pyriminyl (RH-787) to rats and mice was investigated. As a result, the LD_<50> values of technical were 24.4-26mg/kg in male rats, 12.2-27.9mg/kg in female rats, 68.8-90mg/kg in male mice, and 56-68mg/kg in female mice. These values resemble closely that of thallium sulfate and zinc phosphide which are being used practically at present. In the experiments conducted using only 2% baits, all mice died in 1 day later and all rats died within 5 days. Secondly in the experiments of the choice test between 2% baits and rolled barley, no difference of acceptance was observed on mice, but rats showed a little low acceptance to poison baits. In the preliminary experiments using 1% powdered baits and powdered nonpoison baits, however, no avoidance to poison baits was observed on rats and ll died within 2 days. From the above described, Pyriminyl might be anticipated as a promising acute rodenticide in future by adding further more information concerning formulation and concentration.

N2  - Immunological reactions were performed on asthmatic children living in and around Tokyo with the extract of house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, as antigen. Mite fauna in house dusts of the patients was examined and relation between the mite fauna and immunological findings was studied. Higher than 70% or more positive rates were obtained in skin test and radioallergosorbent test (RAST) either to house dust or the mite antigens. On the other hand, passive hemagglutination test and double gel diffusion test against the mite extract were all negative. House dust was collected from the residences of 17 skin test and RAST positive patients and 10 negative asthmatic children. Pyroglyphid mites constituted 70-90% of the mite fauna and constitutional pattern of other mites did not differ in both groups. However, number of mites found in dusts per square meter for a week differed significantly (p<0.05). This study comfirms the importance of the house dust mite in children's asthma and shows that absolute number of mites in the dust plays an important role in the sensitization of children with substantial figure.

N2  - Despite a relatively high prevalence of pregnancy and numbers of embryos produced Rattus norvegicus has a very restricted distribution in the city of Rangoon. Significant changes in the distribution of this rat from that reported 30 years ago were not detected. It is suggested that R. norvegicus distribution and abundance are related to the presence of large numbers of Bandicota bengalensis. The majority (87.2%) of the R. norvegicus captured were infested with fleas. Three species of fleas were recovered : Xenopsylla cheopis, X. astia and Ctenocephalides felis. The possible importance of R. norvegicus with regard to rodent-borne diseases is discussed.

N2  - Some ecological investigations on biting midges, mainly Culicoides nipponensis, were carried out with the light trap or dry ice trap in the cowshed and the paddy area in Mie Prefecture from 1972 to 1975. Results obtained were summarized as follows; 1) Biting midges captured with light trap in the cowshed were C. nipponensis, C. arakawae, C. pulicaris, C. sigaensis, C. odibilis and unknown one, 99% of them were C. nipponensis from June to September. The number of C. nipponensis increased in June and decreased rapidly in October. 2) Two-hourly collection in the cowshed and the surrounding paddy fields were carried out with light traps. From the experiment it was found that there was the difference in the host preference between C. nipponensis and the other species. 3) Biting midges were captured by dry ice traps at 14 points on paddy area in 1974 and 1975. The composition of species was nearly similar to that by the light trap in the cowshed, and 96% of all were C. nipponensis. There were some points where C. nipponensis was captured in large numbers or in small numbers. It is likely, therefore, that C. nipponensis does not inhabit uniformly in all the census area.

N2  - Allied species of the subgenus Leptotrombidium are often very difficult to classify. The author attempts to describe a new species belonging to this subgenus with special emphasis on the morphological stability and the distributional character covering a northern broad area of Honshu, Japan. Leptotrombidium (Leptotrombidium) asanumai n. sp. Body reddish orange, the general appearance of typical Leptotrombidium. Gnathosoma : Palpal pilous formula N-N-BNN. Scutum : The posterior margin is gently curved. AM seta and PL setae (longer than AL setae, measuring 74 long in holotype) have minute and sparse spikes. Sensillae are placed slightly posterior to the level of PL setae, and the proximal half of them is naked. The scutal measurements are almost same in specimens from four different localities. Dorsal setae : Pilous formula is 2-8-6(7)-6-4(6)-4-2(32-35) with little variation. They have the similar spikes as PL setae. Humeral setae measure 69μ long in holotype. Ventral setae : Comprise about 20 anteroanal setae and about 10 posteroanal setae with the similar spikes as DS setae. Coxal setae : One seta is out of anterior margin of coxa III. Ecological data : Eighty-eight larvae ex Microtus montebelli, 1 larva ex Apodemus speciosus, 1 larva ex Rattus norvegicus in 7 localities of Aomori Pref., July 1967 to Nov. 1976; 457 larvae ex M. montebelli in Takanosu, Akita Pref., Aug. 1969. The peak of seasonal occurrence was found from July to November by the author (1976) in Hirosaki Park. Type specimens : Holotype and 7 paratypes preserved in the Department of Parasitology, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan. Remarks and specific diagnosis : This mite is identical with L. sp. No. 50 by Sasa (1956) and L. sp. by Ito and Obata (1961). Historically, Asanuma et al. first obtained it in Oze, Gunma Pref. in 1950,then, Obata et al. found it from a locality of upper valley of the river Shinano, Niigata Pref., but it remained unnamed until today. This mite differs definitely from two related species L. akamushi and L. scutellare, because the scutal size and situation of sensillae are dissimilar, PL setae are relatively longer, the bodies of AM, PL, DS and VSP setae are more stout (4.5-6μ wide vs. about 3.5μ wide in L. akamushi), the spikes are more minute than those of the latter, and also the number of DS setae are less. The author found no difference between the present materials and the specimens of L. sp. No. 50 taken from Oze which was kindly supplied by Dr. K. Asanuma. The species is dedicated to Dr. Kiyoshi Asanuma, The National Science Museum, Tokyo, for the memory of his continual contribution to medical acarology.

N2  - Surveys were conducted in order to clarify the mite fauna in the living environment of asthmatic children in Japan. Dust samples were collected from floor and beddings (Futon) of asthmatic children who were sensitized by the house dust mite (Dermatophagoides). Mites were collected by the method flotation and sedimentation using Darling's solution (glycerin and saturated NaCl) after sieving on 9 and 200 mesh sieves. Ten samples in summer and 13 samples in winter were examined. Average number of mites in 0.5g of fine dust on floor were 168 in summer and 54 in winter. Mite fauna did not differ much from previous reports : Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae were dominant constituting 79% in summer and 66% in winter of the total mite number. Average weight of Futon dust were 0.28g in summer and 0.71g in winter but number of mites contained in Futon dust did not differ much being 72 in summer and 76 in winter. Mite fauna as a whole in Futon dust was same to that of floor dust. Floor dust of a room for new-borns in a hospital and a well-kept patient's house contained relatively few mites however mites were detected in the air. Dusts of air cleaner revealed some mites including D. pteronyssinus. These findings suggest to encourage patients to keep clean of floor and Futon to avoid mite as much as possible.

N2  - Haematopota hikosanensis, a new species is described from Kyushu Island. This species is closely related to H. toyamaensis Watanabe, Kamimura and Takahasi, but can be distinguished from it by the clearly marked median spot and roughly rounded side-marks on frons, straight dorsal margins of antennal scape, a greyish patch on scutellum and dark brown abdomen without any pale marginal bands on each tergite.

N2  - A Japanese leech Hirudo nipponica was examined morphologically by means of the scanning electromicroscope. The most remarkable characteristics are as follows : The minute teeth or denticles had been described by many workers to arrange in " row" on each of the three jaws, but the present observation revealed that "the row" of teeth actually consisted of two rows of denticles and that there were occasionally observed leak, defect and deplacement of the denticles and disarray in the denticular arrangement. A great number of minute tubules are situated between the two rows of denticles, which seemed to be the openings of the salivary gland. The eyes are five pairs in number and concave on the surface, where a pore is observed in the center. Many minute pores are distributed on all the surface of jaw and body, especially abundantly near the annulus grooves and, further, on the inner surface of the anterior and posterior suckers. These minute pores are considered to be the orifice of the mucous gland or that of the excretory canal. The last annulus groove is wide and has a few folds. The penis has many small processes on the surface.

N2  - An investigation on the quantity and the sugar composition of sucked nectars, and the parous rates was conducted on the blackflies collected at Kohzu ranch in Gunma prefecture from June 22 to 24,1974. Five species of the blackflies were recognized. Female of Prosimulium yezoense exhibited the highest nectar-sucking rate of 91.8%, followed by female and males of Simulium arakawae, 90.2 and 87.0 respectively, females of P. jezonicum, 86.2%, the female of S. japonicu, , 81.7%. and females of S. iwatense, 70.0%. These rates were much higher than those observed in horse-flies or mosquitoes. The volume of fully-sucked nectar was 1.7-2.6 l in 3 species of Genus Simulium and 2.4-2.9μl in 2 species of Genus Prosimulium, the variation being dependent on the body size. The sugar contents per 1μl nectar recovered from diverticulums of fully-sucked individuals were 167 to 792 g or 16.7 to 79.2 percent, when analyzed by phenol sulfuric acid method. Paper chromatographic analysis revealed 6 different sugars; fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose, melibiose and raffinose, were in their sucked nectars, the composition of which varied individually. More than half of the fully sucked blackflies possessed 4 or 5 different sugars excluding either sucrose or sucrose and raffinose, although sucrose was always found in nectars sucked by horseflies at the same field. This indicates the species difference in nectar sources. The parous rate of 36.7% in S. iwatense was significantly low in contrast to the other 4 species which showed the value ranging from 65.0 to 71.3%. The rates of individuals having sac-like relics, however, relatively high in all 5 species, the lowest being 46.2% in S. japonicum. These high rates may be attributed to fact that the trapping station was located close to a stream (approximately 20m).

N2  - In order to know the most efficient density for rearing of German cockroaches Blattella germanica (L.) to obtain a number of favorable test insects as possible for insecticide test, dencity effect was examined. Cockroaches were reared in plastic containers (10×16×15.5cm), provided two boads (10×5cm) as a shelter, under laboratory conditions of 25±1℃, 50-60% R.H. and 15 hours illumination a day. 1,2,10,50,100,500 and 1,000 newly hatched nymphs were admitted to each container. The susceptibilities of the emerged adults to fenttrothion were examined by the topical application method. Results were as follows : Generally, the nymphal period was slightly prolonged and adult emergence decreased in accordance with increasing density. The body weight and the length of hide tibia showed the maximum values in the moderate density. The adult life span and the reproductivity were remarkably influenced by densityssize. The female adults, bred in 2 individuals during nymphal stage, survived for 226.0 days and produced 193.8 nymphs per female in average. On the other hand, the female bred in 1,000 individuals, was most inferior surviving only for 107.7 days and producing only 30.0 nymphs per female in average. Due to high density, individuals with damaged wings and antennae increased significantly. There was no significant difference on the susceptibility to fenitrothion among different densities. But insects which were reared under the high densities were slightly smaller in size, and slightly susceptible than others. The number of offsprings per rearing container was the biggest in the container contained 500 individuals, producing 15,737 offsprings. It seemed that taking account of insecticide susceptibility not depending on density, the most preferable rearing density for insecticide test, is 1-2 individuals per 1(cm)^2 of available space in container.

A. sinensis "E (Engaru)" which is a possibly new sibling species of A. sinensis was found only in Hokkaido especially in the northeastern parts. A. lesteri was collected in very low numbers in the southwestern parts of Japan, where this species used to be common, but was also obtained at Yomogita in Honshu, and in Hokkaido. A moderate number of A. sineroides were obtained in Karuizawa and a small number of them in Hokkaido.

N2  - Since 1972 the chironomid midges, prevalent at the near renovated urban worst rivers, have been becoming a serious nuisance in this country. By the light traps run at the infested sites of the river Kanda, Tokyo, 3 species of the midges referable to 2 genera were recognized. The dominant species was always Chironomus yoshimatsui Martin & Sublette. According to the results obtained in 1972-1973 C. yoshimatsui emerge out during a long period from late March to mid December showing definite peaks of emergence in every 2-3 weeks, the maximum population size reaching in late August-September. One adult emergence cycle is approximately in accord with that obtained in laboratory. In 1974 higher peak in prevalence showing in late June-early July and following peak appeared in September. On the other hand large numbers of the midges were prevalent successively from mid June through October and a curve of plateau has been showing in the trend of emergence since 1975. It was also confirmed experimentally that the range of infested area is within 100 meter distance along the river side.

N2  - The seasonal prevalence of flies was studied at a farmhouse located in the suburbs of the City of Daegu in Korea from April 1 through December 31,1964. Glass traps and sticky ribbons were used for collecting flies. The total number of flies collected was 100,961 of 24 species (41,287 males and 59,674 females). Predominant among the species collected were Musca domestica (39.5%), Phaenicia sericata+P. cuprina (17.7) and Boettcherisca peregrina (14.5). These three made up 72% of the total catch. Seasonal prevalences of flies show that the highest peaks of the fly abundance were observed to be in June or July at all sites for traps and other peaks in April, September or October. Three peaks were observed at the sites for ribbons. It was noted that the differences in species, collecting methods and their sites resulted in different patterns of seasonal prevalences. Breeding places and media of flies in Korea were discussed in view of the mode of life and the climate of the country. Known media of the 33 species were described.

N2  - A case of anaphylactic shock from the wasp, Vespa tropica, was recorded in Higashi-Yamanashi city, a typical agricultural area in Japan, on October 12,1976. This case was a 51-year-old female farmer who was stung on the nap by a wasp while working at her farm. Approximately ten minutes later, dyspnea and cloudiness of consciousness developed. When she was brought to hospital at twenty minutes after the wasp sting, blood pressure was unable to obtain and moist rales was audible all over the chest. At approximately 15 minutes on I. V. drip including predoning, nor-epinephrine, aminophyllin and histamics as well as on oxygen, initial symptoms were stabilized and consciousness became clear. The review of hospital charts revealed that ten patients had been treated for wasp or bee stings in the hospital of the present case during the period of October, 1975 to September, 1976. further epidemiological studies on wasp or bee stings need to be carried out. Desensitization therapy may be useful for those known to be hypersensitive to stings. It is also advisable that those especially in close contact with these insects be educated on the danger of their sting.

N2  - A strong cross resistance among organophosphorus insecticides has evolved in the house fly, Musca domestica L., in various places of Japan. Insecticidal activity of prothiophos against these resistant house flies was determined by a topical application method in 1975 and 1976. The average (LD)_<50> value against these 37 resistant strains collected from 24 prefectures was 0.72μg/♀ fly, and the range of it's resistance ratios was 0.8 to 2.7. These results proved that prothiophos, although it belongs to the same organophosphorus group, has a good activity against the resistant populations.

N2  - The schistosomiasis is widely scattered in the world and various control measures have been undertaken to reduce the population of intermediate snail hosts. In the present study, the killing efficiency of 9 kinds of tropical fishes were examined against the intermediate hosts of schistosomes. Fishes examined were Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, C. biocellatum, C. elisalium, C. festivum, Tilapia galilaea, Anoptichthys jordani, Barbus tetrazona tetrazona and B. semifasciolatus. A fish was released into a polystyrene aquarium (23×17×21cm) along with 20 snails, and a sheet of Salan net was inserted horizontally into water at a level of 10cm from the bottom to prevent snails crowling out of the aquarium. Among 9 tropical fishes listed above, Cichlidae was more effective than Characidae or Cyprinidae to kill the snail, Biomphalaria glabrata. Besides, C. nigrofasciatum or convict cichlid was found to be most efficient. The number of B. glabrata killed by a C. nigrofasciatum increased with the increase of snail population from 20 to 60. However, it decreased when the water plant, Hydrilla verticillata, was placed into the aquarium with snails. For example, among 100 snails exposed to 5 fishes in a large aquarium (70×40×22cm), 45 were killed with plant while against 59 without plant. Oncomelania nosophora and Lymnea (Galba) ollura were killed by C. nigrofasciatum effectively as B. glabrata were. The youngs of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata were killed by all the tropical fishes tested within 48 hours.

N2  - A study of mosquitoes was made in each season of 1972-1974,in Chushin District, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. Eleven species were caught in light-traps around human dwellings, includings a pig pen. Anopheles sinensis group predominated among the blood-sucking mosquitoes, and were followed by Culex pipiens pallens and Aedes vexans. The population density of Culex tritaeniorhynchus was assessed to be very low (Table 1). The peak activity occurred in August in A. sinensis group, and slightly earlier in C. p. pallens. The density of C. tritaeniorhynchus decreased after the middle of July in the pig pen. Nine species of mosquito larvae were collected from rice fields by a dipping method. Larvae of A. sinensis group and Culex orientalis predominated, while those of blood-sucking Culex were sparse (Table 2). The intermittent irrigation management, which is widely adopted for the rice fields in this district, evidently depopulates mosquito larvae and influences the species composition of larvae.

N2  - The effects of an insect growth regulator, Dimilin : PH 60-40 (1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl)urea), on early 4th instar larvae of four species of mosquitoes, Culex pipiens pallens, C. p. molestus, Aedes albopictus and Armigeres subalbatus, were studied in a laboratory, under 25℃, 70-80% RH, and the daily 16hr light and 8hr dark cycle. Serial dilutions were tested against group of 20 larvae which were placed in a 400ml plastic vessels containing 200ml of tap water and daily provision 10-20mg of the dry beer yeast. PH 60-40 inhibited adult emergence at concentrations around 0.75 to 1.5ppb almost completely. The EC-50 dosages were 0.72ppb in C. p. molestus, 0.47 in Ar. subalbatus, 0.30 in Ae. albopictus, and 0.18 in C. p. pallens respectively. The mortality at larval stage increased as the concentration of PH 60-40 increased and that the death occurred at the molting period of larvae, pupae and adults.

N2  - In order to analyze the mechanism of ovarian development in the housefly, Musca domestica vicina Macquart, the functional role of fat body was investigated with special reference to nutrient supply to the developing ovary. 1. Histological study on the abdominal fat body of female fly showed that newly emerged one possesses two types of fat body; pupal fat body in a large quantity and adult fat body in a small quantity. The former contains much more amount of lipid and protein, whereas the latter abundantly encloses nucleic acid and lipid. And pupal fat body disappears shortly after emergence as a result of cell-lysis, while adult fat body exhibits vigorous development with aging of adults. Further, a correlationship was observed between the cell-lysis of pupal fat body and the growth of first-follicle. Such a tendency suggests us a close relationship between the function of fat body and the ovarian development. 2. To clarify the function of pupal fat body, the effect of protein or sugar diet on the egg production was next examined. The female fly given only a sugar diet is capable of producing the number of mature eggs which corresponds to about 70% of the milk-fed fly. When females were hemicastrated immediately after emergence, little difference was ascertained in the egg number of remaining ovary between the milk-fed and the sugar-fed ones. From these findings it was suggested that pupal fat body reserves so much quantity of vitellogenic substance to mature the follicles of unilateral ovary. 3. Effects of operation and starvation on the retention of pupal fat body were also investigated. Ovariectomy resulted in retardation of celllysis in pupal fat body, implying an influence of ovarian growth upon cell-lysis. Cell-lysis was also suppressed conspicuously in the starved-, decapitated- and allatectomized flies. With treatment of a juvenile hormone analogue, methoprene, cell-lysis of pupal fat body was accelerated remarkably in all females. From these facts it can be concluded that juvenile hormone stimulates cell-lysis of pupal fat body.

N2  - Trombiculid mites were collected directly from rodents (Black rat, Rattus rattus and Amami Spinous Country-rat, Tokudaia oshimensis oshimensis) and Amami-rabbit, Pentalagus furnessi from February 1975 to October 1975 in Amami Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan (Fig. 1). 1. In results, 6.435 trombiculid mites consisting of 8 genera and 14 species were collected from 183 Amami Spinous Country-rat, 84 Black rats, and of 4,467 consisting of 7 genera 10 species from 6 Amami-rabbits (Tables 1 and 2). 2. L. kawamurai was the most dominant species in rodents. D. zentokii, which was not detected in the collection of unengorged larvae from soils, was collected from the rodents. 3. W. pentalagi was the most dominant species in Amami-rabbit but that was never found in rodents (Table 4). In fact W. pentalagi was specific to the Amami-rabbit, and it was possible to discover this mites infesting the nest of the Amami-rabbit (Suzuki, 1975), this fact has not been known hitherto. 4. Most of trombiculid mites collected are peculiar species to Amami Island, only 3 genera 7 species out of 9 genera 18 species are common to those found in the main islands of Japan. 5. Variation of the trombiculid mites fauna found on host animals is considered to be strongly related to the differences of the natural environments in which they inhabit. This corresponds with the facts of collections of unengorged larval trombiculid mites (Suzuki, 1973) from the nest hole of the rabbit.

N2  - The insecticidal activity of 2-methyl-5-(2-propynyl)-3-furylmethyl 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate (Y-4042) was tested against Musca domestica vicina, Culex pipiens pallens and Blattella germanica by various bioassay methods. The topical application tests showed that Y-4042 is about 7 times as toxic as allethrin against mosquitoes. The KT_<50> of Y-4042 by dryfilm assay and the mortality in 24hr after the application against the other insects were superior to those of allethrin. As formulated in mosquito coils and electric evaporizer mats, Y-4042 proved its particular utility as the fumigants because of its high volatility : against mosquitoes, the Y-4042 coil showed KT_<50>=17min and mortality=100% at 0.4% concentration, whereas the allethrin mosquito coil showed 6.6min and 22.5%, respectively. Y-4042 was also so characteristic that very few mosquitoes recovered from paralysis caused by the application, in contrast to the heretofore known pyrethroids which often permit their revival.

N2  - Tabanus hyugaensis, a new species was recorded based upon materials collected as larvae or pupae from Kyushu Island in 1976. This species is quite allied to T. otsurui Ogawa and T. masamitsui Hayakawa, but differs from both in its almost linear, lanceolate middle callus on frons, more darkened wings, and especially whitish tibiae of mid and hind legs in female.

N2  - Feeding preference of manure-inhabiting mesostigmatid mites, i.e., Macrocheles muscaedomesticae, Parasitus gregarius, and Uroobovella marginata, was determined when they were given a choice between the house fly eggs and first-instar larvae, Musca domestica, in a test container. Under the same condition, these mite species were given, further, a choice of fly eggs (or larvae) and the rhabditid nematode, Rhabditis elongata, as an alternative prey. Finally, predatory efficiency of the three mite species for house fly eggs was examined using fresh pig manure, to which nematodes were added. Both fly eggs and larvae were preferred coordinately by female adults of M. muscaedomesticae. The adults fed preferentially on fly eggs, even when they were given together with nematodes. On the contrary, proto- and deutonymphs of this species preferred to feed on nematodes over fly eggs. Adults and deutonymphal stages of P. gregarius preferred to feed on fly larvae over eggs. Moreover, deutonymphs of this species showed a preference for nematodes over fly larvae and also over fly eggs. Deutonymphs as well as adults of U. marginata destroyed more fly larvae than eggs, when they were given a choice between these two preys. Adults of both sexes of this species showed a preference for nematodes, when they were given a choice between nematodes and fly larvae or between nematodes and fly eggs. Deutonymphs of this species also aggregated and fed on nematodes much more than fly eggs. The rate of predation by female M. muscaedomesticae adults on house fly eggs was kept so high in the fresh pig manure, to which nematodes were added as in the media without nematodes. On the other hand, predatory efficiency of P. gregarius and U. marginata deutonymphs on house fly eggs was much suppressed by the presence of nematodes which were added into the media.

N2  - A study was made on the predatory responses of spiders to te house fly, Musca domestica vicina, which is an important household pest. In this experiment, 123 spider species belonging to 28 families were used in total. The prey flies were captured by 91 species belonging to 20 families. Among them, 41 species (14 families, 26 genera) were recognized as the useful natural enemies because of their efficiency in capturing flies and abundance in nature. The main families capturing the flies were found to be the following three; Argiopidae, Salticidae and Agelenidae. A series of experiments was conducted to observe the feeding behaviour of the following four species; Heteropoda venatoria, Tegenaria domestica, Plexippus paykulli and Theridion tepidariorum. P. paykulli captured all 20 flies put in a cage for a seven day period. However, H. venatoria captured 15 flies out of 20 for only three day period and showed no feeding behavior after. The mean number of daily capture was 4 or 5 flies for both T. tepidariorum and P. paykulli regardless of the prey density. Whereas, the others showed the increased number of capture according to the increase of prey density. H. venatoria prefered to catch cockroaches rather than flies but P. paykulli captured only flies.

N2  - In the present study, we examine three aspects of anautogenous reproduction in Culex pipiens molestus : first, the occurrence of blood-feeding by the nulliparous population, second, what is the status of ovarian development of these engorged mosquitoes, and finally what make use of the blood meal when they take it before the initial egg-laying. Approximately 100-200 laboratory-propagated male and female mosquitoes of the same age, were kept in cage of 20×20×20cm at 25℃ or 20℃. Sugar solution was provided at all times and a mouse as a blood source was exposed for 15 hours only once. Blood-feeding activity of the nulliparous population was observed in 194 mosquitoes or 1.55% out of 12,456 exposed on mice and one out of 3,638 at 25℃ and 20℃ respectively. In contrast, parous mosquitoes had fed on blood 76.19% at 25℃ and 22.76% at 20℃. After the exposure a part of mosquiotes either engorged or unengorged were examined with the ovaries. At approximately six hours after the feeding 13 of the 70 engorged, or 18% only, had the ovaries developed as much as most of the unengorged autogenous females did. However, the ovaries of 9 females were not deposited with the yolk granules at all, 43 females or 61.4% obviously delayed the development, though yolk granules were visible, compared with most of the unfed population, and the other five females were with incomplete ovaries. Among the 36 females that had fed on blood on the 6th day after emergence and were dissected 7 days later, 32 had stage V follicles. The mean number of the follicles was 103.5. On the contrary, unfed females developed only 48.1 follicles at stage V. When the engorged females were dissected two days later, the pattern of ovarian development revealed in most individuals is similar in numbers of stage V follicles and a more numerous sets of secondary follicles at stage III, as already reported in Culex tarsalis by Bellamy and Corbet (1973). Thus the engorged females greatly increased their fecundity by developing the first and second follicular sets at the same time.

By the application with the rate of 1ppm of active ingredients of each insecticide to the fertilizer pots, the larvae and pupae of these mosquitoes disappeared completely in one or three days after treatment. The reappearance date of larvae in the fertilizer pot was the 3rd day after application with fenitrothion EC, the 9th day with fenthion EC, the 15th day with diazinon EC, and the 21st day with diazinon AIC and G. Number of the fertilizer pots of which restoration of larvae population was observed at the 43rd day after application was 7 pots among 8 tested pots with fenitrothion EC, (7/8), 6/8 with fenthion EC, 6/8 with diazinon EC, 3/7 with diazinon AIC and 4/7 with diazinon G.

N2  - The house dust mite has been incriminated as a major allergen of house dust in respiratory allergic diseases. Surveys were undertaken to study the mite fauna in house dusts collected from the residence of asthmatic as well as of non-asthmatic children living in and around Tokyo. House dusts were collected by electric sweeper for a week and stored in a deepfreezer until the observation. Mites were isolated from the fine dust caught on a 200 mesh sieve by flotation and centrifugation method with Darling's solution (equal volume of glycerin and saturated sodium chloride solution). Of 24 samples collected in summer, number of mites varied greatly and the average number was 499 in 0.5g of fine dust or 133 per square meter of floor. As to the mite fauna, Pyroglyphidae constituted 85%, Tyroglyphinae 3.1%, Glycyphaginae 1.3%, Cheyletidae 2.8%, Tarsonemidae 0.7%, Mesostigmata 1.3%, and Oribatei 4.4%. Among Pyroglyphid mites, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus constituted 36% and D. farinae 39% but no significant difference was noted statistically as to the dominancy between the two. Of 9 cases, seasonal change of mite fauna was studied. The number of mites decreased in winter but no statistical difference was found among seasons. Neither the changes in dominant species were noted. Eleven control dust samples were collected from houses without asthmatic patients but no significant difference was noted in number of mites or density per square meter from those observed in the residences of asthmatic children. Mite fauna was also similar to that in the asthmatic houses.

N2  - After a strain of A. sinensis from Kanoya, Kyushu (Japan) was established by induced copulation with a human blood source for its first 26 generations, it has been further colonized for 19 generations in a small cage (30×30×30cm) by free mating at 25±1℃, 70-80% R. H. Larval stages were mass reared on the pulverized food consistng of equal weights of wheat germ, dry yeast and oatmeal. The mating ability of males during induced copulation was investigated; 3 day-old males were completely successful at mating but the quantity of sperm in the spermathecae was very low. The insemination rates were about 16% in the 31st generation, 41% in the 41st generation. A. lesteri has also been maintained mainly with a mouse blood source in a small cage for 15 generations without induced copulation. The insemination rate of this species was about 8% at the 11th generation. The tolerance of the eggs of A. sinensis to desiccation was tested and it was found that the eggs hatched normally after 2 days of desiccation but the hatchability decreased down to 29% after 4 days.

N2  - The subcostal pale spot (Sc p) and fringe pale spot (F p) which are the distinguishing features between Anopheles sinensis and A. lesteri have been found to have a wide variability. The F p (+) of A. sinensis was lacking in 0.3% to 20.5% of individuals examined while the Sc p (+) was a comparatively more stable character, lacking in 0.8% to 6.4%. In A. lesteri, the F p (+) occurred in 1.6% and Sc p (+) 24.9% of the mosquitoes studied. The F p (-) is considered to be stable in A. lesteri. A new kind of wing spot (H p : humeral pale spot) that had never been reported in A. sinensis was found in the Tomakomai and Engaru strains; the rates of appearance of the spots were 23.3% and 23.7% respectively. The frequency of clasper movements in the males of the Tomakomai and Engaru strains during induced copulation was 14.3 and 14.6 respectively, whereas it was about 8 in the males of the other three strains of A. sinensis; this difference was significant at the 1% level. Moreover, these two strains showed a significant difference in the frequency against all the other 5 species or strains tested. From these results it is suggested that there have occurred genetic divergence in the Tomakomai and Engaru strains from the ancestral A. sinensis.

N2  - Comparative rodenticidal effectiveness of five anticoagulants were examined in single and multiple dose administrations. The acute toxicities obtained in this study were rather low in mice for both the coumarin derivatives and the indandiones, whereas those shown in rats were remarkably high. In the subacute testing, the indandiones were shown to be the more potent rodenticides of the chemicals tested. Also, coumatetralyl given to mice was least effective of the five chemicals tested, however, when given to rats, it showed nearly the same effectiveness as the indandiones did. The coumarin derivatives failed to attain 50% mortality at lower dosages in the subacute test, which may indicate a threshould concentration for these chemicals. When the rodenticides were given to rats and mice as the baits, high mortalities were obtained for all of these studied, but the differences among the chemicals were not observed in contrast to the results obtained in the oral administration tests.

N2  - In order to analyze the endocrine system involved in control of oogenesis in the housefly, Musca domestica vicina Macquart, the function of corpus allatum was investigated with special reference to the action of juvenile hormone. After emergence of female fly, the size of corpus allatum increased and attained to the maximum size at the vitellogenic stage. When newly emerged flies were decapitated or starved, both corpus allatum enlargement and follicle growth were inhibited conspicuously. Follicle growth was also inhibited in allatectomized one. These results imply the function of corpus allatum involved in control of housefly oogenesis (Fig. 1). Allatectomized flies were topically applied with juvenile hormone analogue, methoprene (ALTOSID, ZR-515) and the effect on follicle growth was examined. Ovarian development of allatectomized one was stimulated distinctly with methoprene, and all the individuals treated showed ovarian maturation at the dose of 0.25μg (Table 1). Consequently it was proved out that juvenile hormone was a primary stimulus to regulate housefly oogenesis. As a next step of the experiment, influence of juvenile hormone on both processes of oogenesis-initiation and vitellogenesis was investigated. Growth of juvenile follicles in starved- and decapitated-flies was remarkably stimulated with methoprene (Fig. 2). Furthermore, methoprene stimulated markedly the vitellogenesis of normal-, allatectomized- and decapitated-flies which were fed on 10% sugar solution (Fig. 3). Thus juvenile hormone was shown to possess gonadotrophic as well as vitellogenic activity in the housefly.

N2  - We have evaluated lethal effects of the insect growth regulator, PH 60-40 [N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N'-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl) urea], against the larvae of Culex pipiens pallens and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. A 25% wettable powder formulation of PH 60-40 was used for the tests. All test were conducted in 300ml glass vessels each containing 200ml of distilled and deionized water. A certain amount of PH 60-40 was added into each vessel to make suspensions with desired concentration of the active ingredient. Twenty 3rd or 4th instar larvae were introduced in each vessel and about 10mg of dry beer yeast were added as food every 2 days. The temperature of water in these glass vessels remined at 23°±1℃. Since mortality occurs during larval molts, in the pupal stage, and at the unsuccessful emergence of adults, all of these forms were checked every day until all survived larvae became adults to determine total or cumulative mortality. The calculated mortality, determined from the number of adult emergence, was corrected by Abbot's formula. The LC-50 dosage were obtained from eyefitted curves of the corrected percent mortality obtained at each dose. Larval emergence was not inhibited in the egg rafts of Culex pipiens pallens laid 12-18hr prior, but development of the newly hatched young larvae was. At the rate of 0.2 and 0.1 ppb PH 60-40 inhibited adult emergence almost completely. LC-50 dosages of PH 60-40 against larvae of Culex pipiens pallens were 0.035 ppb at the 3rd instar, 0.062 ppb at the 4th instar, and those against Culex tritaeniorhyncus were 0.042 ppb at 3rd instar, 0.060 ppb at the 4th instar, respectively. At the rate of 0.5 ppb, adult emergence from the 4th instar larvae of Culex pipiens pallens was completely inhibited, even larvae tested were introduced 7 days after the treated medium prepared. However, at the rate of 0.125 ppb concentration the lethal effects were decreased after 7 days definitely. In conclusion, PH 60-40 possess a significant lethal activity against the larvae of Culex pipiens pallens and Culex tritaeniorhynchus and appears to be a promissing candidate for mosquito controlling agent.

N2  - Hatching of Aedes albopictus eggs were investigated to clarify their hatching stimuli and manner of their adaptation to environment. Eggs hatched at a higher rate in water containing Chlorella or at a low concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) than in distilled water or water containing high DO. However, the eggs laid by adults, which had been exposed to shorter photoperiod (8 hours light) and/or delyed their blood-feeding, hatched at a lower rate in the same hatching media. Most of eggs kept wet for shorter than six hours after deposition, were killed with subsequent seven day egg-drying. Whereas eggs kept wet for longer than 24 hours, were not malformed but entered to quiescence by egg-drying. When those eggs were submerged in tap water or water containing a high DO, they hatched at a lower rate of no more than 20 percent, but the majority hatched after subsequent submergence in water containing Chlorella or a low DO. Thus, egg hatching response is determined by mainly concentration of DO, and by photoperiod and duration from emergence to blood-feeding at adult stage before egg-laying. Egg-drying after completion of embryonic development lowers the egg-hatching rates. We consider, the hatching response to DO concentration enables eggs to adjust their hatching to food quantity, and the lowered hatching response of eggs laid by delyed blood-feeding mosquitoes may imply their adaptation for avoiding increase of futile adult population when animal hosts are very few. The lowering effect of shorter photoperiod and egg-drying on egg-hatching response are considered their adaptation to overwinter at egg stage and that to prevent most of eggs from hatching just after a passing recovery of water level in their habitat according to a temporary rainfall, respectively.

N2  - 1. In order to investigate the feeding behaviour of the simuliid larvae, they were collected with polyvinyl-tape traps at a branch of Sagamigawa River, the northern part of Kanagawa prefecture, from August 1974 to May 1975 and the compositions of diatom flora in their digestive tracts were compared with those in the stream water, on the rock surface and on the polyvinyl-tape traps in the stream. 2. A great similarity of the diatom flora was found among the simuliid larvae of different species collected at the same location and time. 3. A great similarity was found between the samples collected from the rock surface and those from the stream water. 4. A great similarity of the diatom flora was also found among the digestive tracts, the rock surface and the stream water. Whereas, little similarity was found between the floras of the digestive tracts and polyvinyl-tape traps on which the simuliid larvae attached eventually. 5. It is concluded that the simuliid larvae feed on materials drifting (suspending) in the stream rather than those attaching on rocks.

N2  - Culex pipiens fatigans rarely supports larval development to the infective stage of Brugia pahangi. But it might be noted that if the microfilaria can leave the blood mass and have migrated out of the stomach of mosquito it has a chance to be able to develop to the infective stage in the mosquito. Most microfilariae were trapped in the blood clot and destroyed within 36 hours after feeding on the infected cat. Different developments of filariae were found in the thorax of mosquitoes and only the same stage in each mosquito. Only few microfilariae reached the third stage and the susceptibility rate of C. p. fatigans to B. pahangi was 0.92 per cent.

N2  - Some ecological considerations were made on the distribution pattern of egg, larval (pupal) and imaginal populations of Aedes albopictus in a cemetery area of Nagoya City, central Japan in 1972. The mean crowding (m^^^*)-mean density (m) relation, or m^^^*=α+βm, was applied to the observed individual counts in order to analyze the distribution pattern of the mosquitoes of each stage. The results indicate that the basic components of the spatial distribution seem to be groups of several individuals, and that such small groups of each stage mosquito distribute aggregatively in the area. Two transformation formulae, y=log(x+1) and z=sin h^<-1>√<(β-1)/(α+1)x>, were compared in their efficiencies of stabilizing variance and normalizing variate frequency distribution, with a result that the former transformation was as useful as the latter.

N2  - The changes of concentrations of Na and Cl in the haemolymph of fourth instar larvae of Culex pipiens pallens Coquillet, Culex pipiens molestus Forskal, Aedes albopictus Skuse and Aedes togoi Theobald, which were caused by treatment with artificial sea waters of various concentrations, were measured by radioactivation analysis. C. p. pallens showed no salt regulation (Fig. 1), but those reared in 20% sea water from first to fourth instar acquired a little ability of the salt regulation (Fig. 6). C. p. molestus was superior a little to C. p. pallens in salt regulation (Fig. 2), and A. albopictus was much more superior than the formers (Fig. 3). A. togoi reared in fresh water has an excellent ability of salt regulation (Fig. 4). In the highly concentrated 140% sea water, Na and Cl increased to the maximum values in about 10 hours. After 22 hours they decreased to ordinary concentrations (Fig. 5). This phenomenon shows that the additional strong function of salt regulation is prepared in 10 hours by their acclimation to the highly concentrated sea water. Water temperature renders much influence for the larvae to aquire this function. The concentrations of Na and Cl changed at different rates, and Cl always changed faster than Na.

N2  - German cockroaches Blattella germanica Linne have been known to inhabit regularly definite types of properties such as office buildings, restaurants, hotels, shops and so on, but quite few also inhabit Japanese style wooden houses in Japan. In order to clarify the reason for this behavior, experiments and observations were made on the populations bred in several different environments. 1. Experiments of adaptability to three different structural materials In order to evaluate the adaptability of cockroaches to different structural materials which they inhabit, cockroaches were bred on the surfaces of wood, metal and plastic, at an insectarium kept at 25°±1℃. The periods of larval development were 51.9,56.1 and 59.9 days in male and 53.1,58.8 and 60.1 days in female, on wood, metal and plastic, respectively. It seems that wood is more favorable to German cockroaches than metal and plastic. 2. Comparison of developmental periods of larvae in seven different enviroments The larval periods of breeding groups bred in four different types of properties and under three different constant temperatures were compared during the periods from June to August, 1972. The larval periods were 52.4 days in a concrete office building, 63.6 days in a wooden apartment, 68.9 days in a concrete apartment, 70.0 days in a wooden house and 59.0 days under a constant 25℃, respectively. First instar larvae failed to develop into adults when kept constantly at 15℃ or at 10℃. 3. Comparison of life spans in three different environments Successive breedings were conducted in three different environments, in a concrete office building in Kawasaki, a wooden house in Yokohama and in the insectarium kept at 25°±1℃, and the pattern of life span under natural conditions throughout two years were observed. At the insectarium, six generations were passed successively during the two years without any change of characteristics. For instance, the average of developmental characteristics were as follows : embryonic period 21-28 days, larval period 59.0 days, the period prior to oviposition 9.8 days, frequency of oviposition 7 times in max. and 4.6 times in average, number of hatched larvae per ootheca of the first oviposition 36.8,and longevity of the male 90.0 days and the female 164.6 days. In summer, the cockroaches developed in a concrete building, as well as at the insectarium kept at 25℃. Of four successive generations observed for two years, two failed to survive the winter due to low temperature, because of lack of central heating. On the other hand, when there was central heating a generation was successful in overwintering and reproduced again beyond the winter. And in another one, some individuals overwintered successfully, but no reproduction occurred beyond then. Although they were able to breed normally in Japanese style wooden houses in summer, it seemed unlikely that they could establish themselves regularly there, because of severe low prevailing temperature as compared with concrete building centrally heated, in where room temperature was kept above ca. 15℃ even at midnight of winter. It was concluded, finally, that establishment of German cockroaches to definite types of properties depends principally upon the temperature conditions. Generally speaking, in Japan, they are able to inhabit concrete buildings regularly that there is central heating, on the other hand it seems to be very difficult to establish themselves in Japanese style wooden houses. But, if there are any continuously heated places such as refrigerator or boiler, it might be possible to do so.

N2  - Argas japonicus Yamaguti, Clifford & Tipton were allowed to feed on citrated, heparinized or defibrinated whole bloods of various animals through a chicken skin. The age or sex of the ticks, blood temperatures, 37° and 42℃, fresh or stored chicken bloods and skins did not have any influence on the feeding rate of the tick. Optimal blood temperature lied between 35°&40℃, though the tick fed on blood at a wide range of temperature, 24.5°-44.3℃. The temperature gradient between blood and atmosphere did not have any influence on the feeding of the tick. Ticks fed on mammalian bloods indiscriminately, but some bloods seemed not to be suitable as the food of the tick. Protonymphs were reared up to adults by serial feedings on various bloods through the chicken skin. With the fresh, defibrinated chicken blood, 92.5% of the protonymphs gave rise to adults; 75% of individuals were reared up to adults with the defibrinated chicken and rabbit bloods stored in the deep freezer; only 42.5% gave rise to adults with the citrated chicken blood; all individuals died after feeding once or twice on the defibrinated sheep blood stored in the deep freezer. The AT-31 strain of Japanese encephalitis virus imbibed by the tick through the chicken skin was detectable in the tick for 5 days. It was proved that the orally infected virus did not multiply in the tick, though the virus introduced into the hemocoel could propagate.

N2  - Examinations were carried out on the influence of the quality of larval food substances on the duration of aquatic stage, wing length and autogenous reproduction of Culex pipiens molestus and hybrids of C. p. molestus and C. p. pallens, using the laboratory colonies. Three kinds of larval diets, (A) 3 parts of laboratory chow for insect and 1 part of powdered yeast, (B) powdered yeast aloned and (C) 3 parts of potato starch and 1 part of powdered yeast were used. Fifty larvae of each strain or hybrid just hatched out were put into a glass jar containing 25mg of one of the three diets suspended in 300ml tap water. The larvae were transported everyday to a newly prepared jar with the diet of 50mg, 75mg, and 100mg on the 2nd, 3rd, 4thdday and after, respectively. Females were dissected on the 4th day after emergence. Developmental rate and mean of wing length of each strain or hybrid were maximum in diet A and minimum in diet C. In molestus, the percentages of females with mature eggs were 95.6 to 100,78.3 to 88.9 and 39.2 to 70.9 and the mean numbers of mature eggs in the females were 86.1 to 112.1,59.6 to 70.5 and 24.9 to 45.7 in diet A, B, and C respectively. In hybrids, the percentages of females with mature eggs were a little lower than those of molestus in each diet, while the mean number of the eggs were nearly the same as in molestus.

N2  - Owing to the outbreak of the stink bug (ground bug), Aethus indicus, and its invasion into houses, a large number of the inhabitant in the Amami Islands was afflicted, during the summer season 1974. Thus, ecology of the bug has been investigated at Okinoerabu Island, one of the outbreak areas, since 1975. The census of the bugs on ground surface were carried out at various topographical and biological environments. As a result, the bug was collected only at the areas flourishing with foxtailgrass, Setaria viridis (L.), fingergrass, Digitaria sanguinalis (L.), but not at othertareas. The population density of the adults was as high as 500 per square meter at the suitable habitats. We observed frequently the bugs sucking from the seeds of foxtailgrass on the ground. Rearing in the laboratory giving the seeds as food, it took them 54 days in average to develope from egg to adult emergence during the summer. In the field, the female adults having mated and containing mature eggs were not found in October and thereafter. Since they mate and deposit eggs in the spring, we presume that the field population complete its life cycle twice a year.

N2  - The active flight of the stink bug (ground bug), Aethus indicus, to an electric lamp was observed for several nights during July and August in 1975. The flight activity was in a unimodal type which commenced at after sunset and ended at midnight. The number of adults landed on the pan trap, which was 30co in diameter and placed just under the lamp, exceeded 100 per 5min in maximum. However, such an mass flight was suppressed by wind in over 3.3m per sec. We consider that their flight is activated by such a faint light intensity in the twilight. Dissection of the ovaries of the females, which were attracted to the light, showed the different degrees of maturation. These individuals were, it seemed, not stimulated with their particular reproductive requirement. On the other hand, we could observe that the adults rearing in the laboratory without food had a tendency to crawl out to the surface at sunset time. This phenomenon was extremely less when enough food was given. Therefore, it was expected that the flight activity was initiated for their food finding.

N2  - Surveys of house dust mites were carried out during a period from December 1974 to January 1976 in two households in the suburbs of Tokyo, one in a newly buit concrete apartment house, and another in a nine year old wooden Japanese style house. Both had the rice straw mats (tatami) as the floor material. The mites were isolated from dust collected with a vacuum sweeper at monthly intervals. The dust samples were sieved first with a 9 mesh and a 200 mesh sieve, and fine dust on the 200 mesh was collected and weighed; 0.5g of the fine dust was transferred to a 100ml beaker, sstirred in 50ml of Darling's solution (mixture of equal amount of glycerine and saturated sodium chloride solution in water) for 10min, and was centrifuged for 5 min at 300 r.p.m. The supernatant containing mites were filtered with a Buchner filter, and the mites on the filter papers were collected with a needle under a stereomicroscope. The recovery rate of mites from house dust with this centrifugation and floatation method was estimated to be about 80% of the total mites contained in the original materials. The house dust collected from the new straw mat surface in December 1974 before the apartment house was inhabited contained large numbers of Tyrophagus putrescentiae and Glycyphagus destructor and also small numbers of Tydeus sp. and Tarsonemts sp. These mite species are considered to be breeding in the straw materials. On the other hand, mites of the family Pyroglyphidae, especially Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus began to appear from about one month after the family moved in the house, reached a peak in July at the end of the rainy season and in the beginning of summer. The increase in the predatory mites of the family Cheyletidae and of Mesostigmata occurred after this in September or October. The total number of mites isolated from 14 dust samples collected at monthly intervals from the old Japanese style house was 17,142 and more than twice larger than that of the new apartment house. The most abundant was Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (48.0%), followed by D. farinae (33.8%) : The seasonal density of the seven groups of mites was shown in a table; the peak density of Dermatophagoides was seen also in July.

One ppm of PH 60-40 in the fly breeding medium gave almost complete inhibition of the cuticle formation of the flies during pupal metamorphosis. PH 60-40 also satisfactorily suppressed adult emergence from chicken manure at the same concentrations. Thus, PH 60-40 seems to be efficient for control of the stable fly.

N2  - The interference of the larval populations of Culex pipiens molestus was studied in the successive cultures by introducing groups of 200 or 500 1st-instar larvae in several day intervals. The pupation rates (survival rates of larvae) varied from 88.5% to 4.3% depending on the absence or presence of the interstadial interference. The alternative decreases and increases of the pupation rates in the successive populations demonstrated the self-regulation of mosquito larvae by means of short-living interference chemicals. The percentages of emergence and oviposition, and the day intervals required for larvae to pupate showed no significant interference effects. The mean numbers of eggs in a raft, however, showed slight decreases as the introduction of new populations was repeated. The reproduction capacity (numbers of eggs produced per larva), which are the multiple products of the above figures, also showed the pronounced ups and downs depending on the size of the preceding surviving larval population. The reproduction capacity, 14.9 of the 200 larva populations in the beginning decreased to 1.2 in the 8th population, and 6.9 of the 500 of larva populations ended at 0.9 in the 7th population. The interstadial as well as intrastadial interference of mosquito larvae therefore not only regulates their own population but governs the sizes of the following generations. The importance of larval density in the population dynamics of mosquitos was stressed.

N2  - The nectar feeding activities of Aedes albopictus, which was captured from the field by biting-collection method, were investigated in 1975. The anthrone reaction by Van Handel (1972) was used to detect fructose in the mosquitoes. The nectar feeding rates of 752 males and 1179 females were 62.6% vs 57.0% respectively during the period from late-June to mid-October. Chisquare analysis showed no significant difference between the sexes except late-June female collection and the average feeding rate was 59.1% in the total 1931 mosquitoes. Sugar detection in the mosquitoes collected in the morning (06 : 00-08 : 00) and in the evening (16 : 30-17 : 30) resulted that the five cases were significantly high in the feeding rates in the morning but other six cases showed no significant difference between the both collections. The mosquitoes collected after typhoon were anthrone-positive at the rate of only 18.3%. This suggests that many nectar sources were temporarily damageable by heavy rain and wind.

N2  - The concentrations of Na and Cl in the haemolymph of larvae of Culex pipiens pallens (Cpp), Culex pipiens molestus (Cpm), Aedes albopictus (Aalb) and Aedes togoi (At) were measured by the radioactivation analysis. The haemolymph was extracted from the thoraxes of 4th-instar larvae reared in fresh water at 23℃ for over 150 generations. One μl of haemolymph was put on a 1×1cm piece of filter paper with a capillary pipet. About 60 pieces were irradiated for 15 min in the pneumatic tube (thermal neutron flux 2.34×(10)^<13>n/(cm)^2・sec) of Kyoto University Reactor with suitable number of blank pieces and of pieces spotted by the standard NaCl solutions. Gamma rays of ^<38>Cl was measured by a pulse hight analyser soon after irradiation. About a half day later ^<24>Na was measured. No pretreatment was necessary, the measurement required less than 2min for each sample. The Na content was approximately 100mM for all species and higher than the Cl content. At had the highest Cl concentration (65mM), whereas Cpp had the lowest (40mM) (Fig.1). The changes of Na and Cl concentrations in the larval haemolymph were also studied by the treatment with artificial sea waters (Barnes' process). The Cl concentration increased faster than the Na concentration. Being in the 60% sea water for 2.5 hr Cpp had about 5.1 times of the initial Cl concentration, but Cpm had less 3.2 times. The resistance to salinity seems to be a distinctive feature between these two related species. In the 60% sea water Aalb could live after 5hr. At showed an extremely superior ability of ionic regulation. The 100% seawater caused no effect on At.

N2  - Summer assemblage of simuliid immatures in the River Kaunnai was studied. Five species comprising 3,625 specimens were collected with the following relative abundance : Prosimulium (Distosimulium) daisetsense (64.3%), Simulium (Simulium) japonicum (30.7%), Simulium (Eusimulium) konoi (3.1%), Simulium (Eusimulium) sp. 3 (1.2%) and Prosimulium (Prosimulium) yezoense (0.7%). Relative abundance and distribution of the body size were changing gradually from down- to upstream in the main river (MR) while without such change in the tributary streams (TS). Distribution of the five species was : P. daisetsense at most sites of MR and TS, P. yezoense chiefly at the lower section of MR and sporadically in TS, S. konoionly from TS, S. sp. 3 chiefly in TS, S. japonicum in MR and TS below the altitude of 1,040m. There found two size groups in P. daisetsense and S. japonicum. In P. daisetsense the small sized group was collected at the lower section of MR and the narrower TS while the large one at the upper section of MR and TS as wide as MR. Both groups were mingling at the middle section of MR. In S. japonicum two groups were found at the lower section of MR and at a site of TS but large one alone at the middle section of MR and other several sites of TS. The difference of size appeared resulting in the different growth rate affected by the water temperature.

N2  - On June 24,1962,Dr. Goiti Nakata captured an unfamiliar male cockroach in his home in the midst of Kyoto City. Subsequent inquiry yielded one broken male specimen without any locality indication being preserved in the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, and a female specimen taken in 1943 at Fukuoka by the late Prof. Teiso Esaki and preserved in Kyushu University. Additional specimens discovered from the fleld were : 3 broken males from Awashima Island in the Japan Sea taken by Mr. H. Higuma; one fine female from Ogi, Ishikawa Prefecture, taken by Dr. H. Sasaji; one female taken at Ajinomoto Manufacturing Factory, in Kawasaki near Tokyo. However, a series of living material was fortunately found at the Zoological Garden in Okazaki Park, Kyoto. Last year two female specimens were sent from Dr. Y. H. Sin taken at Mt. Keryongsan, Chungcheongnam-Do, Republic of Korea, for identification. This cockroach is an entirely unknown insect from Japan and its generic affinity was here finally attributed to a North American genus Parcoblatta, a genus never known from East Asia. Through an exchange of opinion with Dr. A. B. Gurney, U. S. National Museum, I am now naming this cockroach as belonging to this particular genus. My thanks are due to Dr. Gurney for his very helpful suggestion.

N2  - Larvae of the moth fly, Telmatoscopus albipunctatus, were most active at about midnight and moderately active during the light period in the laboratory. Adult flies in captivity showed similar activity rhythm to that of the larvae. An observation in the field revealed that catch size of adult flies escaping a septic tank was maximum around sunset; the percentage of female flies decreased and the gravid rate increased in phase with the active time of the escaping flies. Eight species of moth flies were collected in a hen-house in a residential area of Nagoya City, among which Psychoda alternata and T. albipunctatus were most abundant (99.3%). The prevailing periods of these two moth flies were fairly segregated from each other : T. albipunctatus prevailed in the warmer months of August and September, while P. alternata from May to July. Both the percentage of female and the gravid rate were higher in P. alternata during the studing period. The adult flies in the septic tank were observed to die out in the winter months and the aquatic population seemed to overwinter mainly as the fourth instar larvae.

N2  - From 1968 to 1971,mosquitoes were collected on the top of Mt. Ikoma, 642m above sea level by using a dry ice light trap, for one hour after sunset once a week during the period from June to September. The unfed females of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus collected in 1970 were dissected to determine the physiological age composition and to observe the developmental stage of follicles. For comparison, similar surveys were conducted in paddy fields at three sites on the Osaka plain. 1) On the top of Mt. Ikoma, 9 species of mosquitoes were found. C. tritaeniorhynchus summorosus was the dominant species throughout the four years, followed by Anopheles sinensis and Aedes vexans nipponii. 2) Although the pattern of seasonal prevalence of C. tritaeniorhynchus summorosus females at the top of Mt. Ikoma is similar to that on the Osaka plain, the number in the former site generally tends to increase later and decrease earlier than in the latter site. 3) Even at the top of Mt. Ikoma, many parous females of C. tritaeniorhynchus summorosus were found. They were, for the most part, uniparous, with a few biparous. The greater the number of mosquitoes collected, the lower the parous rates. 4) The percentages of females with follicles at IIb or more advanced stages were generally higher both in nulliparous and uniparous females on Mt. Ikoma being apart from paddy fields than on the Osaka plain.

N2  - Efficiency of a method, using a static quadrat device (25×25cm, 25cm high, square steel chamber, open at both ends) and a small suction pump (air cleaner), in sampling of mosquito larvae and pupae was examined experimentally in the laboratory and in a rice field. A known number of individuals were released in the quadrat device and after a while they were collected into the trap bottle with the pump. The accumulated capture rate in the laboratory test was nearly 100% when the water removal treatment was repeated 3 times in the quadrat device for each larval instar of both Anopheles sinensis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Till the second removal treatment, the rate was more than 75% for all tests and was not influenced by the larval density in the quadrat device. In the field test, the rate till the second removal treatment was more than 80% for each larval instar and species in spite of the inconvenient condition of dense vegetation in capturing the larvae and pupae. By using this method it is possible to estimate the absolute density of individuals with some accuracy for practical survey in rice fields.

N2  - Tetrastichus hagenowii (Ratzeburg) is a small wasp parasitic to the eggs of the cockroaches. The parasitism by T. hagenowii on oothecae of the smoky brown cockroach was investigated in Shizuoka city during 1972 and 1973. Oothecae collected mainly in pigpens and laboratory animal-houses and the cultured ones set in Asabata pigpen for a few weeks were investigated. The results were summarized as follows : 1) The parasitic rate was 48.5-62.3% in the oothecae collected from natural population. The parasitic rates of oothecae collected in pigpens and animal-house were significantly higher than that observed in the other collecting sites. 2) On an average, 35.0% of the oothecae which were set in a pigpen at Asabata was parasitised by T. hagenowii. However this rate was markedly lower than those of the oothecae collected in natural population. The investigation on parasitism by setting cultured oothecae is very useful to study the population dynamics of T. hagenowii in the field. 3) The parasitism of T. hagenowii is gregarious; 59.3 and 2.6 wasps emerged from an ootheca and an embryo, respectively. The average sex ratio was 5 females to 1 male (83.7%).

N2  - Chiracanthium japonicum is well known as a poisonous spider. The geographical distribution of the spider was studied in various localities in Japan during the period from 1959 to 1975. This spider was recognized to distribute widely in Japan. From the study on the vertical distribution at Mt. Kyoga located on the Nagasaki-Saga prefectural border, Kyushu, South Japan, they were found widely over various heights, though they were most abundant in the zone from 200 to 300m in height. Ecological field study was made on the seasonal change and habitats at the mountain of Shironokoshi in Nagasaki Prefecture during the period from March to September in 1967. The total number of 1331 spiders, which consisted of 577 male and 754 female spiders, was recorded from the survey areas. They were distributed mostly in bush, especially in Gramineae groups during the period from May to July. The laboratory observation was made on their behavior, especially on mating, breeding and hatching. Among them, it was the most dramatic behavior that the spiderlings caught and killed their mother after the second molting. The parasitic insect which was observed on the back of this spider was identified as Homonotusiwatai Yasumatsu (Hymenoptera; Pompilidae). The best method for eliminating this species to prevent arachnidism is by means of the weeding of the grass belonging to the family Gramineae at areas close to houses in April before the final molting of male spiders. Children must be taught that this spider is dangerous, because they are more often bitten than adults.

From 239 rodents consisting of five species, a total of 41,961 trombiculid larvae was collected, of which 91.6% were Leptotrombidium (Leptotrombidium) intermedium, 7.7% were Neotrombicula tamiyai, 0.3% were N. japonica, and 0.4% were Gahrliepia (Gahrliepia) saduski. Among them, N. tamiyai is new record for the central Hokkaido. Seasonal fluctuations of larvae of trombiculid mites are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2. The difference in the average number of the mites was observed among the hosts. In a descending scale, as follows; Clethrionomys rufocanus>C. rutilus>Rattus norvegicus>Apodemus giliacus and A. argenteus. And also, the difference of the modes for attachment to a host was observed among the species of the mites; L. intermedium and N. tamiyai were mainly found in the ear conch of the rodents, and, G. saduski and N. japonica, which presented the elevated volcano-shaped wheals at the attached sites, on the hind body region. Making reference to the previous reports in Hokkaido, the present study revealed that L. intermedium, N. japonica and G. saduski are found in all vegetations (Table 3). Generally, according as vegetation is simplified, species number of the mites is decreased and, to the contrary, the average number per host is increased.

N2  - Some considerations were made about the minimal number of samples for obtaining population fluctuation curves of mosquitoes on the basis of light trap collections in a given area and in a week. (1) In dealing with these subjects, the mosquito counts were transformed into y=log(x+1) values to normalize the data, and seasonal fluctuation curves were expressed by the Williams' means (Mω=antilog y^^^--1) obtained from the data thus transformed. Two kinds of the fluctuation curves were obtained from the periodical sampling data : one kind of the curves was derived from each of the mean values Xi (i=1,2,…, 15,16) of log-transformed mosquito counts in the randomly and successively accumulated samples, and the other from the mean values Y (=X_<17>) calculated using the total sample. The similarity between the two kinds of fluctuation curves was compared by γ^2 values (coefficients of determination) between the two means, Xi and Y. The degree of agreement between Xi and Y was expressed by a and b values of the regression line, Y=a+bXi; and the precision of Y estimation by Xi was evaluated in terms of the ratio, σY・X_i/Y^^^- (%) (σY・X_i=standard error in Y estimation by Xi) (Figs. 1,2). As a result, about 8 sampling sites among the total of 17 were sufficient to obtain about 90% closeness of the two kinds of the fluctuation curves expressed by the Williams' means (Fig. 2). (2) The same procedure was applied to obtain the minimal number of samples in a week in a given sampling site. As a result, the light trap collections in three nights a week gave 90% closeness to the every-day sampling in the seasonal fluctuation pattern, when the trap was operated at about the same intervals (Figs. 3,4) (3) Discussions were given of the differences between the results in this paper and those reported so far with respect to the operation schedules of light trap in a week, from the view points of variability and convergency of each accumulated samples to the total ones.

N2  - The nectar-feeding activities of Aedes and Culex mosquitoes were investigated in the laboratory and field in 1974-75. The anthrone reaction by Van Handel (1972) was used to detect fructose in the mosquitoes. The feeding tests of three species of mosquitoes on the flowers of 11 nectar plants showed that Aedes albopictus was heavier feeder than other two species, Aedes togoi and Culex pipiens molestus, and the last was lowest in the feeding rate. The rate of nectar feeding, however, varied depending on the flower species offered. C. p. molestus appeared to feed heavily on some nectar flowers such as snowbell and sumac. The nectar-feeding activities of the mosquitoes increased gradually with the days after emergence; A. togoi fed on the flowers of chestnut tree reached a peak of 97.9% on the 9th feeding day. Both male and female A. albopictus which had been fed on the flower nectaries showed 80-90% feeding rate during 8hr after the feeding, but only 31% after 24hr, while the percentages of individuals reacted heavily with the fructose reagent decreased rapidly with the time elapsed. An investigation on natural nectar feeding of the wild-caught A. albopictus indicated that the feeding rate of males was significantly higher than that of females, 65.1% vs 53.6%, during the period from late-September to mid-October. The females of C. p. pallens, C. orientalis and C. hayashii collected from the caves during the winter months, from November to February, were anthrone-positive at the rates of 10.9%, 3.2% and 3.7% respectively. A small number of other species such as C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. bitaeniorhynchus were negative. When 13 females of the overwintering C. p. pallens fed on the loquat flowers in a laboratory cage in mid-December, 46.2% were fed heavily in 24hr. This proves some of the mosquitoes to re-feed on plant nectar during the early overwintering period.

N2  - A survey on the thelazian parasites and their intermediate hosts was made in the farm of Miyazaki Livestock Breeding Station in Kobayashi City, Miyazaki Prefecture in July and October of 1973. Of five genera and 8 species, totaling 3,392 flies were collected from cow bodies and Musca hervei was dominant. M. hervei occupied 73.6% of total flies in July and 54.2% in October. Four flies of M. hervei (0.2%) in July and 6 flies of M. hervei (1.2%) in October were infected with thelazian parasites and no parasite was found from the other fly species. The infected rate of flies in Kobayashi City was much lower than that in Kanto district, especially than that in Chiba City which showed 18% in October of 1973. Totaling 83 thelazian parasites belonging to Thelazia rhodesi and T. skrjabini were obtained from cows, and T. rhodesi was dominant (93%). A survey in Okinawa Prefecture was made in Ishigaki City and Kunigami-Son, Okinawa main island in 1974. No parasites and infected flies were found in this area. It is supposed that no intermediate hosts are distributed in this district.

N2  - Argas japonicus Yamaguti, Clifford and Tipton wintering in 2 Delichon urbica nests were collected at Agematsu, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, on November 17,1967. All the nymphs other than protonymphs were reared individually on chickens up to adults in the laboratory. Using the informations on the sex, retrospectively, following data were obtained. 1. The wintering population comprized 48 larvae (8.9%), 146 protonymphs (27.0%), 215 deutonymphs (39.7%), 10 tritonymphs (1.8%) and 122 adults (22.6%). 2. The sex ratios for the deuto- and tritonymphs and for the adult did not deviate significantly from half-and-half. 3. There was a very high regression of the idiosomal width toward the indiosomal length in the nymphal and adult stages. 4. The idiosomal lengths of the protonymph, deutonymph and adult were normally distributed, respectively. 5. Smaller sized deutonymphs oftener gave rise to tritonymphs in the laboratory. The difference by potential sex in the ratio of deutonymphs that passed through the 3rd instar nymphs was nonsignificant. 6. The idiosomal length of newly emerged ticks that were fed on chickens in the laboratory was described by the regression of the length of the preceeding stages. The regression coefficient was significantly larger in the female than in the male.

N2  - The acaroid mite, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, is a household insect and commonly seen in Japan. This mite can be controlled using paper sheets which were sewed up to the entire upper and lower surfaces in Tatami-mat impregnated with fenthion. We conducted the safty evaluation on the paper sheets. Animals were maintained on the Tatami-mat or on the paper sheets during period of one, two and three months. The amounts of fenthion applied were 0 (untreated), 0.25,0.7,2.0 and 6.0g per m^2. In the practical amounts of 0.7g per m^2,the result indicated that there was no adverse effect on the general condition and appearance in the mice and rats as compared with untreated group. On the indirect contact test to the Tatami-mat, the inhibition of plasma and erythrocytes cholinesterase activities were observed in the mice after two to three months period. On the other hand, when animals were directly contacted on the paper sheets, the cholinesterase activity of plasma and body weight gain were reduced in the mice, and also, the inhibition of cholinesterase activity was observed in the brain of rats after one month period.

N2  - The spider, Chiracanthium japonicum, has been well recognized as poisonous by common people in Japan. Especially in Tohoku, North Japan, this species has been most feared of toxic spiders and named "Kuchiguro" because of having black jaws for killing or paralyzing their prey. Eleven cases of arachnidism caused by this species were recorded during the periods from 1973 to July 1975. In the present paper, an analysis was made on total nineteen cases of arachnidism including the eight cases which had already been reported since 1956 in Japan. Results were as follows : 1. Arachnidism caused by Chiracanthium japonicum occurred from May to August with a marked peak in June. 2. Arachnidism in males was more frequent than in females and most frequent bites occurred in teenagers. 3. It was remarkable that many cases of arachnidism occurred during sleep at night by male spiders which were infesting houses. 4. The site of bites was most frequently observed in upper extremities. 5. The symptoms of arachnidism were characterized by local skin legion as continuous sharp pain, erythema, swelling, petechiae and pigmentation, and frequently combined with generalized signs of nausea, vomiting, loss of appettite, headache and shock. 6. In treating the arachnidism, it was a serious problem to relieve continuous sharp pain of biting area. The use of central analgesic such as narcotic drugs seemed to be effective.

N2  - Under an assumption that the age of the population of female mosquito, Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus Dyar, captured in the pig baited traps will be older than that in the dry ice baited traps, the dimensional difference of the Ib follicular stage was compared between two populations. The follicular size of nulliparous and monoparous sac-like females, in the dilatation stages of a population in a pig baited trap was significantly larger than that of a population in a dry ice baited trap. However, the Ib follicular stage in each physiological age of the population in the pig baited trap was not significantly different in size between the specimens collected in the earlier and the latter half of the night, and such tendency was also recognized in the case of the population in the dry ice baited trap.

N2  - The efficacy of the two JHAs, methoprene and hydroprene, to inhibit embryonic development of the human body louse, Pediculus humanus corporis and the bed bug, Cimex lectularius was evaluated. The LD 50's values of hydroprene against the body lice was 4.25μg per (cm)^2. Methoprene appears to be less effective than hydroprene. Contrary, methoprene was remarkably effective on the bed bug embryos, its LD 50's being about 7.25μg per (cm)^2,but hydroprene was not. Distinct differences in ovicidal activity between the 2 species were observed for these compounds.

N2  - Field surveys of the distribution of domiciliary cockroaches were conducted in Tokyo and Kawasaki during the period between 1972 to 1974. In Tokyo, dead cockroaches collected from various types of buildings following insecticide treatment by pest control operators were brought to the laboratory and identified. Among a total of 286 buildings surveyed, 172 (60.1%) were restaurants and snacks, 25 (8.7%) offices, 14 (5.0%) food factories, 12 (4.2%) residences and 12 (4.2%) supermarkets. A total of 2,802 cockroaches was collected including Blattella germanica (93.7%), Periplaneta fuliginosa (4.8%), P. japonica (0.5%), P. americana (0.8%) and P. australasiae (0.2%). However, the findings cannot be taken to represent the general tendency of cockroach infestation in Tokyo since a disproportionately high number of restaurants and offices, which are the principal clients of pest control services, were surveyed. A correlation between the type of structural property and established cockroach species was examined and a dominance of B. germanica was shown in all cases. This was especially striking in the case of structures constructed within the past 5 years. In Kawasaki, a total of 145 cockroach adhesive traps were set in offices, restaurants, stores, apartments, residences and farm houses on two occasions in both summer and winter. Species compositon of trapped 1,755 individuals was B. germanica (78.6%), P. fuliginosa (20.7%) and P. japonica (0.7%). B. germanica was dominant over P. fuliginosa in offices, apartments, restaurants and stores, while the opposite was true for residences. In farm houses, P. fuliginosa was most abundant followed by P. japonica. A distinct tendency for the abundance of B. germanica in urban buildings, P. fuliginosa in residences and P. japonica in farm houses was observed. Furthemore, P. japonica has never been trapped during winter, suggesting that they had entered diapause.

N2  - Some investigations on the chemical control of the larvae of chironomid midges were carried out in the Suimon river which runs through the center of Ohgaki City, Gifu Prefecture. The river was so heavily polluted due to drainage from the factories that no midge larvae could bread there before the Water Pollution Control Law was enforced in 1971. The midge-swarm problems arose in Autum 1973,because of the enforcement of regulation of the drainage from the factories which improved the biological oxygen demand in the water from 85ppm in 1970 to 12ppm in 1974. The density of the larvae per 40(cm)^3 (20(cm)^2×2cm in depth) of the bottom mud was estimated from 126 to 186 before the river was treated with temephos. In the laboratory test, 45% of the tested larvae was killed and the survivals were intoxicated at 12 hours after the treatment when they were dipped into 0.8ppm (AI) of temephos WP for 60 minutes. In the field test, the river was treated with the temephos WP for 60 minutes at 1ppm of the flowing water volume. At 9 days after the treatment, no midge larvae were found at about 1.6km downstream from the application spot. The temephos showed no poisonous effects on a loach up to 10ppm in the laboratory test. A loach, carp, crucion and top minnow habitating in the river were not affected by the temephos treatment.

N2  - The spider, Heteropoda venatoria, has been known to be an effective natural enemy of pest insects like cockroaches and flies. The field study on the geographical distribution of this spider was made during the periods from 1963 to 1966 and from 1972 to 1973. It covered 174 points in 42 prefectures. Results were as follows : 1. This spider was recorded at 137 points in 35 prefectures. 2. This spider was found more abundant in the southern parts of Japan, as Kyushu and Chugoku districts and in the Pacific side of Honshu Islands including many southern remote islands. 3. The northern boundary of habitats of this spider was found to lie on the area of six different prefectures, namely Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gumma, Nagano, Toyama and Ishikawa Prefecture. Those prefectures lie at 36°-38°North Latitude and in the zone of the annual mean temperature of 12°-14℃.

N2  - The development of resistance of houseflies to organophosphorus compounds at the dumping-islands in the Tokyo Bay has been reported by the present author since 1966. In the 3rd "Yumenoshima" where full coverage of OP spray is being performed daily, an enormous number of single fly species, Musca domestica vicina, has been established. The LD 50 values of flies collected from the 3rd "Yumenoshima" in June, 1974 were correlated to those of the 15th dumping-island colony in 1973. In September, 1974,a remarkably increased OP resistance was found, with the LD 50 values of 5.21 microgram for diazinon, 54.9 microgam for fenitrothion, 9.62 microgram for fenthion and 0.581 microgram for dichlorvos. On the other hand, they were still susceptible to pyrethroids.

N2  - Some considerations were made on the conventional interpretation of results of mosquito sampling with light traps, on the basis of the statistical analysis of the distributional patterns of adult populations. 1) The statistical analyses were made on the relationship between means and variances calculated from field data of three dominant species sampled at 17 sites in Nagoya City (Fig. 1) during the period from June to September 1972. It was revealed that spatial distribution of individuals of each species seemed to be an aggregated type and to fit well to the negative binomial distributions with a common parameter k (Fig. 2 and Table 1). 2) Comparison was made among three methods of transformation, log(x+1), log(x+k/2) and √<k>sin h^<-1> √<kx>, in their efficiencies of stabilizing variance and normalizing variate distribution (Fig. 3). The three transformation methods were compared also in their practical usefulness. As a result, the log(x+1) transformation was adopted because of its facility in practical use and its adequate efficacy in normalizing data. 3) The log(x+1) transformation was applied to the field collection data of Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett, and several advantages were discussed from the viewpoints of normality of observed values and effectiveness in the significance test of means. Williams' mean (Williams, 1937; Bidlingmayer, 1969) was proved to be more suitable than arithmetic mean in interpreting fluctuation of population size in an area as a whole and in comparing abundance of mosquitoes between sampling sites (Figs. 4,5,6 and 7). 4) The relationship was analyzed between seasonal fluctuation pattern of C. p. pallens in all the sites and that in each of these sampling sites (Fig. 8). As a result, it seemed very difficult to estimate fluctuation pattern in the whole area from a result in a certain sampling site; so that it will be necessary to take sufficient samples for the consistent estimation of population fluctuation in the whole area.

N2  - Spider bite cases hitherto reported in various districts in Japan during the period from 1954 to 1974 were sixteen. Spiders of medical importance were nine spcies; Araneus ventricosus, Theridion tepidariorum, Latrodectus hasseltii, Oedothorax insecticeps, Coelotes modestus, Coelotes sp., Clubiona sp., Chiracanthium japonicum and Heteropoda venatoria. The largest spider among them is Heteropoda venatoria and bites were most frequently caused by Chiracanthium japonicum. Of sixteen bite cases, seven were caused by male, six by female and the rest by unidentified spiders. The most frequent bites occurred at a moment of catching spiders directly by hands during the warm season from May through August. The spider bites occurred most frequently in upper extremities, especially on right fingers. These cases were classified by the severity of clinical manifestations into four types, symptomless, mild, moderate and severe. There were four bite cases caused by four spider species in symptomless, two cases by two species in mild type, five cases by four species in moderate type and five cases by two species, Latrodectus hasseltii and Chiracanthium japonicum, in severe type. Latrodectus hasseltii has been found from Ishigaki and Iriomote islands in Ryukyu islands, south Japan. The clinical manifestation by L. hasseltii reported was characterized by burning pain at bite lesion, discomfortness over chest, anxiety for death and dyspnea. The clinical couse by Chiracanthium japonicum among cases in the present study was severe in four cases and the rest three were moderate, mild and symptomless. Severe cases were caused by all male spiders. This clinical picture in severe cases was characterized by headache, nausea, anorexia, general malaise and disturbance in gait due to sharp pain over the lesion. The problem in the treatment was difficulty in relieving continuous sharp pain and generalized symptoms by any anodynes or sedatives.

N2  - Surveys on spider fauna have been carried out to know the seasonal change, breeding season, habitats and role as predators of pest insects in a cattle barn and surroundings in Saga Prefecture during a period from April to October in 1968. In total, spiders observed were 53 species belonging to 46 genera of 22 families among which seven species were dominant, namely Oecobius annulipes, Theridion tepidariorum, Neoscona nautica, Nephilia clavata, Agelena limbata, Pardosa T-insignata and Oxyopes sertatus. The maximum number of spider species was recorded in June; 47 species. The preys by web-spiders were shown to be mainly the species of Diptera. The total number of preys recorded were 283 Nematoceras, 411 Bracyceras and 306 of other insects. Especially, the preys of spiders were the species of Suborder Tipulidae, Chironomidae and Muscidae (Diptera). The species of the order Nematocera were trapped by the viscid lines of the webspider, Argiopidae, especially the genus Aranea, and the species of the order Brachycera were killed mostly by web-spiders and some by hunting spiders.

N2  - The insect growth regulator, methoprene, was evaluated against mosquito larvae in the laboratory. Methoprene, which contains more than 90% of the active ingredient, was diluted with ethyl alcohol, and applied to 20 larvae kept in 250ml of distilled water in a 85×100mm container at 25℃. Granulated larval food was added as required. The individuals which failed to moult into normal pupae or adults were counted every day until all surviving larvae became adults. The following results were obtained. 1. The sensitivity of larvae of Culex pipiens pallens to methoprene varied with the developmental stages (IC)_<50> values were 0.028ppm at the late 3rd-instar and 0.00037ppm at the very late 4th-instar stage. 2. The effects of methoprene to seven species of mosquito larvae, Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus, C. orientalis, C. infantulus, Aedes togoi, A. albopictus, A. aegypti and Armigeres subalbatus, were compared. This compound exhibited only moderate activity against six species, but less activity against Armigeres subalbatus. 3. The emergence-inhibiting effects of methoprene (technical ZR-515^<[○!R]>), and its slow-release formulations, SR-10^<[○!R]> and SR-10F^<[○!R]>, persisted for several days to the larvae of C. p. pallens. The field tests were conducted against the natural populations of C. p. pallens breeding in the lotus ponds in the summer of 1974. The larvae in all stages and pupae were numerous at the time of application. The slow-release formulations, SR-10 and SR-10F, were applied by a spray mobile at the rate of 1.0 or 10g of the active ingredient per 100m^2 of the pond surface. Daily pupal collections and bioassay of the treated water were conducted. The treatments at the higher dosage prevented the mosquito emergence from the ponds for 11 days and at the lower dosage for 7 days.

N2  - In the previous paper, the authors reported that fat in the diet might be important elements among the nutritional requirement of Dermatophagoides farinae. An experiment was made to observe the relation between the population growth of D. farinae and 21 kinds of fat in the diet. Each diet was made from fishmeal and dried yeast powder from which fat was reduced and added one of 21 kinds of fat at the ratio of 5%. About 1,000 mites were inoculated onto 20g of the diet and kept at 25℃ and 60% R. H. The mites in 0.5g of the culture medium were counted once in two weeks by the saturated saline floatation method. 1) Four to 6% was an optimum rate for peanut oil. When peanut oil were added to the non-defatted diet, the population density was found to decrease in proportion to the oil content increased. 2) Higher reproduction of D. farinae was observed in the diet to which one of following fats was added : plant fat : linseed oil, soybean oil, cotton oil, sesame oil, peanut oil and olive oil. animal fat : cod-liver oil, butter, lanorin, and lard. others : lecithin, monoolein, tripalmitin and tristearin. 3) No reproduction of the mites was occured in the diet with following fats : castor oil, coconut oil, lavender oil, triacetin, tributyrin, monolaurin and monostearin. 4) Remarkable reproduction of the mites was occurred in the diet with lecithin. The highest count of the mites was 16,600 in 0.5g of the lecithin medium at 16 weeks. 5) Higher reproduction of the mite was observed in the diet with fats which contained either oleic acid, linolic acid or palmitic acid.

N2  - Using small model water-courses formed with a tin gutter (depth : 0.07m, width : 0.1m, length : 1.8m, water velocity : 15m per min) suspended in a stream, larvicidal effects of some organophoshorus insecticides were evaluated against the last instar larvae of Chironomus yoshimatui Martin & Sublette which are serious nuisance at some urban river sides in Tokyo, Gifu and Ogaki. The larvae used in the test were collected from the river of Kanda in 1972 and had been reared in succesive generations in our laboratory. Four emulsifiable concentrates of insecticides; temefos 5%, fenitrothion 10%, fenthion 5% and malathion 20%; were used. In glass tube contact method which was performed by exposing naked larvae closed in a bottomless glass tube to the stream treated with a certain concentration of the insecticides, temefos among insecticides tested was most effective and the others were insufficient when the insecticides were introduced into the stream at the concentration of 1-2ppm as active ingredient to the volume of the stream flow for a period of 10min. Because Chironomid larva is usually inhabiting in their nest among the bottom mud, another contact test with the nested larvae was performed by introducing the condition of their natural habitat into the water-course. It was confirmed also that the effectiveness is strongly fluctuated due to the above mentioned circumstances, whether or no the nest case is existent. Therefore, the practical application should be made with consideration concerning the matter. A range of concentrations of insecticide must be decided in relation to a length of time for treatment.

N2  - The antigenic structure of the adults of Culex pipiens pallens (Cpp), C. p. molestus (Cpm) and C. p. fatigans (Cpf) were studied with each rabbit anti-sera by immunoelectrophoresis. The results obtained were summarized as follows : 1. In the cases of immunization with these 3 species, 24-26 precipitin bands were observed between the antigens and its homologous antisera, and 16-24 bands were also showed in the heterologous reactions. 2. The common antigenicity between Cpm and Cpp was proved to be more than that between Cpm and Cpf. The common antigenicity between Cpf and Cpp was stronger than that between Cpf and Cpm. 3. Two to 6 residual bands after absorption procedure were recognized between Cpm and Cpf, and 2 bands each between Cpm and Cpp, and vice-versa. 4. Two special bands were demonstrated in Cpm and 1 band each in Cpp and Cpf by absorption procedure. These special bands appeared to be relatively different on each species. From the relations of antigenic affinity among these 3 species, the closest species-relation was observed between Cpm and Cpp, followed between Cpp and Cpf, and between Cpm and Cpf.

N2  - Pyridaphenthion, a new organophosphorus insecticide, was evaluated against three species of insect pests of public health importance. Pyridaphenthion was proved to be as effective as other common organophosphates against house flies, common mosquitoes and German cockroaches, showing somewhat slow-acting but fairly long residual effect. The half effective life of Pyridaphenthion was 100 days on a filter paper, 20 days in an artificial sewage water, and 35 days in diionized water. When the chemical in air was collected and analized by gaschromatography in the progressing time after the residual spraying to the wall in a greenhouse, the concentration showed 146μg/m^3,highest, just after spraying, but rapidly decreased to 13μg/m^3 at 24 hours.

N2  - The mite, C. malaccensis, originally isolated from rice and kept for several generations, was examined as to its morphological charcteristics in each stage of growth, partly by means of scanning electron microscope. The consecutive observation on the evolving variations of the teeth of the inner palpal comb and the basal process of the palpal claw of the female confirmed that a variation which was once identified as C. fortis, did belong to C. malaccensis. An inverse correlation (r : -0.72) was noted between the two ratios : ratio of the length to the width of the palpal femur, and that of the distance between the pair of posterior central setae to the distance between a posterior central seta and a nearby posterior marginal seta on the anterior dorsal plate of the male. A comparative study of characteristics in each stage discloses that there are two prominent basal teeth present on the palpal claw during immature stages. The number of setae of the palpal femur, palpal genu and idiosoma during immature stages was generally less than that during adult stage. The chaetotaxy of legs of deutonymph becomes equal to that of adult, while it remains immature in protonymph and larval stages. The morphological properties common through all the stages (from larva up to adult) are large palpal claw, palpal comb, segmental number of peritreme, feather-like setae on idiosoma, scapular setae, solenidia of leg I, II and setal number of femur I, II, tibia II, III. A comparison of C. malaccensis with Cheyletid mites of Volgin (1966,1969) on each stage suggests that the following morphological characteristics should be regarded as supra-generic and supra-specific features : ventral seta of gnathosoma, ala of rostrum of male, numbers of dorsal and ventral setae of idiosoma and numbers of setae of legs except femur IV and tarsus I.

N2  - A preliminary exposure of more than 28 days to 15°±1℃ and short day length could induce final instar nymyhs of P. fuliginosa to tolerate a chilling temperature of 5.5°±0.5℃ for 90 days. The nymphs seem to enhance their resistance to cold without entering "true diapause". Second instar nymphs reared at 15°±1℃ seem to be more resistant to cold than those reared at 20°±1℃.

N2  - The present investigation was carried out to see relation between longevity of the overwintering house mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, and their wing length. The long-lived mosquito survived about 60 days after capture when fed with no diet except water and survivorship curve of all the mosquitoes proved to fit well to an equation, R=100-99.63×(0.01517)^<(0.8952)^t>, where R is survival rate (%) on the t'th day after capture. This overwintering population was found to include two different component groups : one was a long-winged group which accounted for about 92% and the other was a short-winged group making up 8% of the population. The rate of mortality increases with age in such a manner that its logarithm is proportional to age in every wing-length category. On the basis of this mortality-age relationship, Gompertz equation, M=kp^<q^t>, was applied to the survival data of each wing-length category, where M is cumulative mortality (%) on the t'th day after capture and k, p, q parameters constant for each category. From this equation the "half-life period" of each wing-length category can be estimated. It follows from this estimation that the longer wings the mosquitoes have, the longer period they survive on the whole with only a few exceptions. Discussions were given of a possibility that the blood-fed mosquitoes belonging to the short-winged group might be capable of taking in Japanese encephalitis virus in late summer, of carrying the virus through the winter and of transmitting to vertebrate hosts in the next spring.

N2  - A study was made on the distribution and population density of the spider, Theridion tepidariorum, which is well known as one of the natural enemies of pest insects, in various localities in Nagasaki Prefecture in 1966. The number of T. tepidariorum was observed over eight different kinds of environment : forests, paddy field, farms, caves, sewers, houses (urban and suburban) and cattle barns. Their population density was highest at the inside of animal sheds and houses, in which this spider was found abandantly in the barn, kitchen and latrine. The seasonal prevalene in the house and the breeding season in three stations were also surveyed throughout a year. The peak of the population density in the house was observed in June and July. Many egg-sacs were layed in the warm season from May to August with a marked peak in June and a few in the rest seasons. The mean frequency of oviposition per female in a whole life was 3.08 and the mean number of eggs per egg-sac was 347.1. The preys of this species were insect species belonging to the orders Blattaria, Dermaptera, Isoptera, Hemiptera, Mecoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, Among them, many of the flies, chironomids (Diptera) and Blattaria were trapped by the web more frequently than any other insects.

N2  - An observation was made on the nectarsucking behavior of the blood-sucking horseflies, Tabanus iyoensis, which were captured by nets at 7 different stations in Toyama Prefecture in 1972 and 1973. 1. Fifty-nine to 97 per cent horseflies of the total population captured were found to have taken nectar before coming for blood-sucking. although the nectar volume in the abdomen differed in individuals, and by captured date, time and station, approximately 14 per cent individuals retained 7μl or more (fully-sucked), 30 per cent from 3 to 6μl (medium-sucked), and 38 per cent only from 1 to 2μl (a little-sucked). The sugar contents of 5μl nectar in the abdoment of the fully-sucked individual, when analyzed either by phenol sulfuric acid- or anthrone-method, were 1.0 to 2.8mg or 20 to 60 per cent in concentration. 2. Six different sugars from mono- to trisuccharide, i.e. fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose, mellibiose and raffinose, were detected by the paper chromatography. Although the combination of sugars differed in individuals, approximately 60 per cent fully-sucked individuals contained either all 6 sugars or 5 sugars without raffinose or mellibiose. 3. Two peaks of nectar-sucking activity were observed daily. This daily cycle seemed to occur regularly. Nevertheless, a slight change was caused by weather and by the physiological conditions of the horseflies themselves. 4. Comparison of the nectar-sucking behavior between autogenic Tabanus iyoensis and anautogenic Tabanus chrysurus revealed that the former showed 12 per cent fewer individuals in nectarsucking but 3- to 5-fold concentration of sugar in the abdominal contents. Approximately 27 per cent fully-sucked individuals of the former species preserved sugars both in the diverticulum and the midgut, whereas the latter species (also in T. trigeminus) did only in the diverticulum.

N2  - The fauna and distributions of the black flies in Yamanashi Prefecture were investigated by collecting the early stages of flies from the streams. The survey was conducted with 32 streams in February and March of 1971. The water temperature of the streams ranged from 5°to 8℃ during the period of the observation. On 33 spots out of 57 investigated the aquatic stages of the black flies were collected. They were 14 species belonging to two genera as shown in the following; 1) Prosimulium kiotoense 2) Simulium uchidai 3) S. subcostatun 4) S. mie 5) S. kobayashii 6) S. aokii 7) S. iwatense 8) S. bidentatum 9) S. japonicum 10) S. arakawae 11) S. suzukii 12) S. rufibasis 13) S. kawamurae 14) S. sp. A Among these the six species, that is P. kiotoense, S. subcostatum, S. mie, S. kobayashii, S. aokii and S. sp. A. were collected for the first time in the Prefecture. So far 12 species had been recorded in the district, therefore the fauna come to include 18 species of three genera. The hitherto unkown larvae of S. kobayashii were collected by the authors at one spot in a concrete ditch running to the River Fuji. The distribution characteristics of several species were discussed.

N2  - Presumably attracted by the light a large number of Cydnid bug, Aethus indicus, invaded into the houses in a town on Okinoerabu Island (37°30″N. 128°35″E) at about 8 pm. on July 18,1974. The invasion lasted for four nigths and occurred again August for five nights. The inhabitants were being afflicted with offensive smell emitted by the bugs and suffered from the contamination of food and drink with their stink fluid. In addition, 76 cases of earache caused by the entry of the bug should been treated by local clinics. Similar outbreak of cydnid bug and earache cases were recorded simultaneously from two adjacent islands, Tokunoshima and Yoron. The cases of the earache were 35 as reported from these two islands.

N2  - One new species of genus Fannia is described from Japan (Honshu and Amami-Oshima Is.) and Taiwan. It is difficult to determine the status of the species-group. Regarded from the genitalic structure the present species seems to belong to the pretiosa group, and to be closely allied to Fannia horii Kurahashi and F. tunisiae Chillcott. Fannia coracula Collin, F. mollissima (Haliday), F. nigra Malloch and F. vesparia (Meade) are newly recorded from Japan. European F. nigra has not hairs on posterior inner margin of hind coxa, but some of the Japanese specimens have setulae on hind coxae. Although this character is very important in the identification of the genus Fannia, it is not so substantial in F. nigra.

N2  - The 3rd stage larvae of 4 species belonging to the genus Morellia R.-D. from Japan are described and figured. Those are M. saishuensis Ouchi, M. hortensia (Wiedemann), M. hortorum (Fallen), and M. aenescens R.-D. External characters of those species are similar each other, however, posterior spiracles of saishuensis, and shape and size of anterodorsol spines in each species are characteristic. Those are most useful characters for identification of Morellia-larvae. The larva of M. saishuensis is newly described in this paper.

N2  - Topical application tests were made to compare the susceptibility of Musca domestica against diazinon and malathion. These flies were taken from Osawa area in Chiba Prefecture, where organophosphorus compounds had been applied since 1960. The test insects, F_1 subcolonies of the flies, were reared from eggs laid individually by female flies caught in piggeries. The susceptibility to diazinon was very variable among 20 subcolonies obtained from the same breeding habitat, with the LD_<50> values falling between 1.4 and 19.6μg for "piggery A", and between 7.4 and 27.8μg for "piggery B". When 10μg of malathion were applied to 10 subcolonies the 24 hour mortalities fell between 0 and 43.3%.

N2  - Some analyses were made on the overwintering populations of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, collected during the period from October 1969 to March 1970,and on the field populations sampled in a hen house and a pigsty from May to November 1970. 1) Wing length distributions of parous females were compared with those of all the overwintering females. The wing length of the parous females distributed in shorter ranges of the overwintering population, and a general trend was observed that the shorter the wing, the higher the parous rate (Fig. 1). This seemed likely that many of the female mosquitoes belonging to the overwintering short-winged group joined to the long-winged group after blood feeding and oviposition in the prevalent season. 2) Parous rate of the population decreased from about 8% at the beginning to 4% at the end of overwintering period (Fig. 2). This seemed to imply that mortality of the parous females was slightly higher than that of the nulliparous ones in the overwintering population. 3) In early summer, average wing length of the field populations collected in a hen house and a pigsty, was at a level of the overwintering population, and decreased to the minimum at August. It remained at the average level of the overwintering short-winged group from around September to early October, but in early November appeared a small number of individuals with average length near to that of long-winged group (Fig. 3). Both in the hen house and in the pigsty populations, the parous rate increased remarkably in autumn and reached to the maximum in early October, when the average wing length remained at the level of the overwintering short-winged group (Fig. 3).

N2  - Weekly investigations on oviposition activity of mosquitoes were carried out by an ovitrap method in four study areas in Kamakura City from May to December in 1971. The percentages of ovitraps found positive showed a sharp increase at week 27. A high level of ovitrap positivity was observed during weeks 31 through 35. Oviposition activity decreased significantly by week 36. The late-season peak appeared in these areas during weeks 38 and 39. A total number of the eggs deposited in ovitraps was recorded as 10,841 for C area, 8,653 for B area, 7,813 for D area and 6,680 for A area respectively. The sensitivity of the ovitrap was closely related with its placement. The total numbers of the eggs of one trap which was placed on the same site ranged from 14 to 1,074 (average 340) during 28 weeks. The following 8 species were found : Acdes albopictus, Tripteroides bambusa, Uranotaenia bimaculata, Aedes japonicus, Aedes nipponicus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Armigeres subalbatus and Aedes flavopictus. Aedes albopictus was the dominant species (73.9 percent) followed by Tripteroides bambusa (13.1 percent) and Uranotaenia bimaculata (9.1 percent). The collections of the four study areas indicated that the species compositions were resembled each other but the relative abundances were different. In A area the percentage of Aedes albopictus was greater than in B area. It appeared that suitable oviposition sites by Aedes albopictus increased with enlargement of the housing area. Ovitraps proved to be a better method for detecting of Aedes albopictus and other small-container breeders.

N2  - Studies on the biting activities and seasonal prevalence on Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) samoanus, two main vectors of subperiodic bancroftian filariasis in Western Samoa, were carried out by human bait collection method. The results are summarized as follows : There are two peaks in the biting activities of Ae. polynesiensis. The afternoon density is higher than the morning one, and the outdoor biting density is higher than the indoor one. A considerable number of this species also bites man at night, particularly on bright moonlit nights. Ae. samoanus has the highest peak of biting activity during the third quarter of the night. No difference was observed between the outdoor and indoor biting density of any mosquito species collected at night. There is no clear relationship between biting activities, temperature and relative humidity. The seasonal prevalence of these two mosquito species correlates mainly with the rainfall.

N2  - A series of surveys have been carried out on the spider species as natural enemies of pest insects in a garden of Sakurababa-machi, Nagasaki city over a period from 1955 to 1959,and from 1963 to 1966. A total of 87 species (61 genera and 26 families) including 40 common species were recorded in the garden through the observation years. The number of spider species was found abundantly from May through August particularly. The predominant species were the spiders belong the families of Argiopidae, Salticidae and Theridiidae. Most of the spiders were distributed in the bush and on the outer walls of the house but few on the ground. The insect species which destroyed by the spiders were also recorded; the preys confirmed were insects belong to the orders of Collenbola, Odonata, Blattaria, Orthoptera, Dermaptera, Isoptera, Hemiptera, Mecoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera. Especially great numbers of houseflies and chironomids (Diptera) were captured by almost all the spider species in the garden. The chironomids were trapped by the viscid lines of webs.

N2  - Glycyphagus destructor (Schrank, 1781) is commonly found in stored food and house dust in Japan, but relatively little is known about its biology. The author observed the effects of temperature to the growth and reproduction of this species by individual rearing method. The colony used was started from hypopi collected from house dust at a house near Tokyo and had been bred for generations in the laboratory. The containers used for keeping the mites were glass tubes, 1cm long and 1cm in a diameter, which were covered with a transparent plastic sheet on one side and with 200 mesh size of wire screen on the other. A few eggs of the mite were placed into a container, and were exposed to seven different levels of temperature ranged from 2℃ to 37℃. All the containers were kept at relative humidity of about 85% R.H., and a mixture of equal amount of dried yiest and laboratory animal food powder was provided as the food for the mites. Each container was examined every day under a stereomicroscope. The mite passes four stages in a life cycle, egg, larva, protonymph, tritonymph and adult. No hypopal stage was observed so far as the present observations concern. The days required for a life cycle from newly deposited eggs to the first oviposition of the females were 72.8 days in average at 10℃, 27.8 days at 15℃, 21.5 days at 20℃, 10.0 days at 25℃ and 9.6 days at 30℃. The eggs did not hatch at 2℃ as well as at 37℃. The survival rate of mites which completed the development from larva to adult was usually more than 95% at the temperature levels 15-25℃. The life span of the females as well as their oviposition period was the longest at 10℃, and the period became shorter as the temperature was raised, but the average number of eggs produced per day per female increased as the temperature became higher, with the maximum figure of 6.8 eggs per day per female in the average at 25℃. The sex ratio of adult which emerged at 25℃ was ♀ : ♂=1 : 0.8,and their 50% survival period of the adult at 25℃ was 15 days in females and 11 days in males. The average survival period was 16.1 days in females and 13.3 days in males.

N2  - During a period from Oct. 1971 to Sept. 1973,a monthly survey of blackfly larvae and pupae was made at 8 stations on the Kobotokegawa river systems in the suburbs of Tokyo. 1. The number of individuals collected in this survey totalled 11,216,containing 11 spp., among which Simulium japonicum, S. bidentatum and S. suzukii were most numerous, whereas, S. subcostatum, S. uchidai, S. rufibasis, S. kawamurae, S. shogakii, S. arakawae, S. aokii and Prosimulim kiotoense were few in number. 2. Larvae of S. japonicum and S. suzukii were collected throughout the four seasons. 3. Many larvae of S. japonicum, 76%, were infected with nematodes, but the larvae parasitized were restricted during the period between February and April. 4. The infected larvae possessed from one to six nematodes. Among the 216 infected larvae 165 larvae contained 1 Nematode, 39 larvae 2,6 larvae 3,2 larvae 4,3 larvae 5,and 1 larva 6.

N2  - In recent years the availability of compounds with juvenile hormone (JH)-like activity has led to extensive efforts to evaluate their potential as insect-control agents. In the present paper, the emergence inhibitory activity of methoprene, and its slow-release formulation (SR-10[○!R]) was evaluated against house fly larvae, Musca domestica vicina, using 4 testing methods in the laboratory. Methoprene was remarkably effective when 6 day-old larvae were placed on water film containing 0.156ppm or more of the test compound for 2-3 days. Adult emergence of fly larvae, which had been kept continuously in the larval media containing 0.625ppm or more of methoprene, was mostly inhibited, even when they had been introduced to the media at 3 day-old stage. Furthermore, methoprene was showed to be effective when it was applied topically to the larvae. The ID-50 value was calculated as approximately 0.3μg/larva on the 6 day-old larvae. This fact suggests that methoprene may have a high ability of penetration through the cuticle comparable to the efficiency of fenitrothion. Distinct differences of the lethal pattern were observed between methoprene and fenitrothion, for example, the former killed at pupal stage and the latter did at larval stage. It might be due to an essential difference on the mode of action. Thus, we concluded that methoprene had a high inhibitory activity on adult emergence and its practical application was expected as a fly larvicide.

N2  - A survey was made on the distribution in the Tokyo Metropolitan area (Kanto Plain) of the two mosquito-larvivorous fishes, Gambusia affinis (top minnow or mosquito fish) and Oryzias latipes (medaka) by our direct inspection as well as from the information responding to the questionnaires from 859 middle schools in the Prefectures of Gunma, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa and Tokyo. Gambusia affinis is a poeciliid ovoviviporous fish introduced into Japan in 1916 from southern United States via Hawaii and Taiwan for the purpose of malaria control, and has been noted recently to be distributed in rather polluted waters in and around the city of Tokyo, whereas, Oryzias latipes is a native fish widely distributed in streams and ditches containing cleaner water. Gambusia affinis was found in ditches and swamps in the more urbanized areas near the coast of the Bay of Tokyo, especially in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Chiba, and also in the areas north of Tokyo lined by the Rivers Arakawa and Furutonegawa, where the waters were more or less polluted by sewage. Sporadic distributions of this species were noted in the ponds in Tokyo, Utsunomiya and Tsuchiura where the fish had been introduced artificially. Oryzias latipes was found in the rural areas surrounding these large cities, particularly in rice paddies and streams in Kanagawa, Saitama, Gunma, Tochigi, Ibaraki and Chiba Prefectures. Large numbers of Gambusia have been observed to be inhabiting in the water of the Bay of Tokyo near the wharf of Tokyo Harbour, and thus we assume that it has established in a number of canals along the Bay shore by them selves.

N2  - A series of field investigations was made on the imaginal mosquito populations occurring in a suburban area of Nagoya City, central Japan. 1) During the period from May 1972 to May 1973,an investigation was made on the seasonal fluctuation of the imaginal masquitoes. As a result, most (99.6%) of the adult mosquitoes collected with light traps were Culex pipiens group. 2) Discriminant function was applied to the identification of the two house mosquito biotypes, or autogenous Culex pipiens molestus and anautogenous C. p. pallens. As a result, 66.4% of the males and 75.4% of the females in the collections were regarded as C. p. molestus. 3) A breeding place of C. p. molestus was found to be the final settling tank in sewage treatment plant adjacent to the area. Female mosquitoes reared from larvae and pupae collected at the tank were tested for the presence of autogenecity, and 96% of them proved autogenous.

N2  - An ecological study was made on the overwintering populations of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, in 6 caves of 3 localities in Aichi Prefecture (Fig. 1), central Japan, during the period from October 1969 to March 1970. Female mosquitoes captured were C. p. pallens (Cpp), C. hayashii, C. orientalis, C. vorax and Anopheles sinensis in order of decreasing numbers (Table 1). Overwintering females of Cpp appeared on the inside walls of the caves in October, became most abundant in January of the following year and decreased toward March. Monthly fluctuation patterns in catch size of the mosquitoes were similar to those obtained separately by counting without removal (Fig. 2). Wing length distribution of the overwintering Cpp females did not show the normal distribution, whereas that of field-collected summer populations proved to be the normal one (Fig. 3). Using probability paper analysis, the overwintering populations were found to be composed of two different groups with regard to wing length; one was a long-winged group which accounted for about 90% of the populations and the other was a short-winged group (Figs. 4,5 and Table 2). Similar phenomenon had been observed in the same localities in the previous year (Makiya et al., 1971). In order to know closely whether autogenous C. p. molestus (Cpm) were intermixed with the overwintering anautogenous Cpp populations, discriminant function derived from 5 characters was applied to differentiate the two biotypes. As a result, most of the ovewintering females were identified as Cpp, but a few individuals (8&acd;10%) were morphologically regarded as Cpm. The overwintering short-winged group, however, seemed not be Cpm, because wing length of most of the individuals regarded as Cpm fell within the range of the long-winged group (Table 3 and Figs. 4,5).

N2  - A laboratory colony of adult mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), was experimentally fed with royal jelly, a glandular secretion of the honey bee Apis mellifera L. Results indicated that mosquitoes, deprived of a blood meal, showed an increased tendency to develop mature ovaries and oviposit viable eggs as a result of feedings of increasing concentrations of royal jelly. This experiment was divided into two stages of observations as outlined below. The initial stage of this experiment was concerned with observations of accelerated follicular development as a result of royal jelly feedings at various concentrations. A total of 720 females and 360 males, which emerged within a 24 hour period, were maintained in equal numbers in 12 separate cages (25×25×25cm). Ten cages of mosquitoes were fed graded concentrations of royal jelly (0.5% to 20.0%). The remaining two cages of mosquitoes each received daily feedings of a 5% sugar solution, however, the mosquitoes in one of these cages were given a blood meal from a mouse on their first day after emergence. On the 8th day after emergence all of the female mosquitoes were dissected and stages of follicular development were recorded based upon the criterion of Christophers (1911). It was found that the percentage of mosquitoes which attained stage V of follicular development increased as a result of feedings of increasing concentrations of royal jelly. The second stage of this experiment was an attempt to determine the viability of mosquito eggs which had been oviposited following royal jelly feeding. A total of 600 female and 600 male mosquitoes were divided equally into 5 separate cages. Mosquitoes in three cages received royal jelly feedings in concentrations of 5,10,and 20% for three days, and the remaining two cages served as controls and received feedings of other diets for three days. After this initial three day period, approximately 40 females from each cage were placed in separate tubes containing water to facilitate oviposition. Royal jelly feeding was maintained for nine more days and on the 9th day the number of oviposited eggs was observed. Also, the degree of follicular development was examined by observing the number of follicles in each stage of develoment. It was found that mosquitoes were able to oviposit viable eggs as a result of royal jelly feeding.

N2  - The bait tablets containing 0.1 or 1% propoxur, carbary, dieldrin, DDT, BHC, lindane, naled, fenthion, malathion, fenitrothion, diazinon, or trichlorfon showed repellency more or less against German cockroaches, when tested with the similar tablets containing no insecticide. Propoxur, naled, and BHC were highly repellent, whereas trichlorfon was little. The consumption of the trichlorfon-bait by an alive cockroach per day was much greater than that of the propoxur-bait on the first day of the experiment, whereas the consumption of the nonpoison bait kept as the control increased later on. Many cockroaches (more than 10%) could survive on the bait containing 0.5% propoxur and 20% boric acid, although the bait containing only the latter would have given the complete mortality. The strong initial repellency of propoxur in the bait would be responsible for the decreased mortality of the cockroaches. The consumption by the living cockroaches of both poison (propoxur and trichlorfon) and nonpoison baits decreased as the tests progressed. The similar trend was observed when we treated the cockroaches with the sublethal doses of the poisons. Satisfaction of their appetite or loss of their appetite by the intoxication, or both are the possible causes for the decreased bait consumption.

N2  - A series of surveys have been carried out on the spider fauna of houses in various districts of Nagasaki Prefecture, and on the role played by various spider species as predators of house-infesting insects. In total, 45 species belonging to 37 genera and 22 families were collected, among which 29 species (24 genera and 13 families) were the weavers, and 16 species (13 genera and 9 families) were the hunters. Oecobius annulipes and Theridion tepidariorum were the most common species encounter in the houses surveys, and their seasonal changes in population density and the indoor distribution were investigated in detail. The behavior of the two common wandering spiders in houses, Heteropoda venatoria and Selenops bursarius, was specially investigated. They were found most abundantly in barns, but were also common in living rooms with straw mat floor (tatami), in corridor, in latriums and in kitchins. A variety of insect species were shown to be killed by the spiders; the preys confirmed in the present survey were the members of the orders Collembola, Blattaria, Orthoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera. The cockroaches (Blattaria) were found to be caught mainly by the wandering spiders, such as H. venatoria, H. focipata and S. bursarius. Mosquitos and chironomids (Diptera) were captured by the wandering spiders such as S. bursarius, Hasarius adansoni and Plexippus paykulli, and trapped by the viscid lines of weavers. Houseflies (Diptera) were observed to be killed by most of the house spider species, especially by the wandering ones. In an observation on the predation of a wandering spider, S. bursarius, a total of 42 winged ants, 22 chironomids, 6 houseflies and 2 cockroaches were found to be sacrificed while the author had watched it for 4.5 hours every night for 11 consecutive days.

N2  - In 1907 Shelford described "Phyllodromia japonica" from "Riou-Kiou, Oshima, Japan." He soon transferred it to the genus Liosilpha, but it had remained neglected until Princis included it in the genus Shelfordina in his Blattariae Catalogus (1969). In 1973 I had an opportunity to examine the type specimens (2 ♀♀) in the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, and found them to be a Symploce species which was the same with "Ischnoptera testacea (Shiraki, 1908)" known from Kyushu, Japan. In the present paper, the synonymies were clarified and a description was given for both the sexes, as the male insect has never been described. I took this opportunity to designate the Lectotype specimen to be one of the females in the Paris Museum, the right side one in Fig. 1. For the Allotype specimen I selected a male individual taken by Mr. S. Tachikawa at Yuwandake, Amami-oshima in the Ryukyus. (Fig. 2) The distributional range of this species hitherto known covers Amami-oshima, Takarajima, Tenagashima and Kyushu (Kumamoto, Unzen, Amakusa, Nagasaki). Specimens from Takarajima have a more rounded supra-anal plate in the male insect (Fig. 14). It is interesting to note that this species is most closely allied to Symploce okinoerabuensis Asahina (1974), a cavernicolous species found from Okinoerabu Island situated to the south of A-mami Island.

N2  - By topical application, we studied diazinon and malathion susceptibility of 30 F_1 subcolony of houseflies, Musca domestica L., which were established from 30 females collected from a farm in Hokota. The LD_<50>'s of diazinon against the most susceptible and resistant subcolonies were 0.095 and 2.6μg per female fly respectively. When malathion applied at the dose of 10μg per female fly, the mortality of subcolony varied from 0 to 100%. We concluded that susceptibility of houseflies to insecticide varied widely even when they were collected from the same breeding habitat.

N2  - In order to clarify the actual situation of insects of medical importance carried into Japan by aircrafts, the survey was conducted by checking the inside of the international aircrafts just after arriving at Tokyo International Airport, during the period from July 1972 to August 1973. Of 42 aircrafts surveyed, 10 species of the pest insects, excluding several unidentified species, were captured in 24 aircrafts. Musca domestica Linne and Culex fatigans Wiedemann were collected most abundantly, 59 and 24,respectively. Of 10 species identified, 5 species were exotic ones and the other 3 were either the exceptional or rare ones around Tokyo. It is worth to note that an engorged female of Aedes aegypti (Linne), an important vector of yellow fever, and Anopheles subpictus Grassi, a malaria vector, were caught. It must be emphasized that important mosquito species were carried mainly by the flights via Bangkok, Hongkong or Manila, whilst the house flies were abundantly carried by Seoul and Khavarovsk lines. In order to know the possible place where the mosquitoes embarked on the aircrafts, a discussion was made considering the actual time schedules of the flights. As for the house flies the levels of the insecticide susceptibility between the captured insects and Japanese colonies were compared.

N2  - Lethal effects of a juvenile hormone analogue, methoprene (ZR-515[○!R]), and its slow-release formulation A (SR-10[○!R]), were tested on larvae and pupae of Culex pipiens pallens and Culex tritaeniorhynchus at different developmental stages. Methoprene, which contains more than 90% of the active component, was emulsified with 0.03% (w/w) Tween 80 and 5% alcohol solution. Certain amount of the diluted emulsion or slowrelease formulation A, was stirred into glass jars containing 200ml of distilled water and 30 mosquito larvae or pupae at the particular developmental stage. Minute amount of brewered yeast was added as a food. The temperature was maintained at 25℃. The individuals which failed to moult into normal pupae or adults were counted every day until all survived larvae became adults. EC_<50> values of methoprene against Culex pipiens pallens were 0.03ppm at late 3rd instar, 0.02ppm at late 4th instar, 0.0006ppm at pharate pupal stage and 1.0ppm at one-day-old pupae, respectively. The lethal effect of slow-release formulation A to C. pipiens pallens larvae proved to be more potent than methoprene perse, but not to pupae. Almost the same figure was found in the experiments on Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The phenomenon that the susceptibility to the compound increases gradually toward the pupation and decreases drastically after the pupation was in accord with the theory on the secretion and action of juvenile hormone in the physiological and endocrinological studies.

N2  - 1. This is a report on the investigation of the seasonal and diurnal activities of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus leaving a pig shed. This work was carried out at Natori City, Miyagi Prefecture in 1965. 2. Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus was abundantly collected with the pig baited trap and showed a high rate (73.3%) of engorgement. 3. The percent engorgement of the mosquito population were maintained at higher than 80 percent from late June to mid August and decreased abruptly after late August. While the partial engorged females appeared after late August. 4. The diurnal activity of the engorged females which leave a pig shed showed a pronounced peak at 04 : 00-05 : 00,but that of the unengorged females was not clear. And the diurnal changes of the percent engorgement were very similar at every season. The high rate of engorgement at dusk falls immediately in the range of 20-30% and after two or three hours increased steeply.

N2  - Duration of larval growth in Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus was studied under various photoperiods and temperatures. The growth was delayed by the short photoperiod (10 hours per day) (Table 1). In 14 hours of light, which is longer than critical day-length for induction of diapause at 25℃ (Ito et al., 1968), the wing length of the females lengthened remarkably. But, the duration of the larval stage did not change notably, though it lengthened when the larvae were reared at day-length shorter than 12 hours of light (Fig. 1). Under the long day condition the relation between water temperature and developmental velocity in the larval stage was linear between 16.6 and 34.0℃. The developmental zero temperature and the thermal constant of the larval stage was calculated as 8.3℃, and 110.6 day degrees, respectively (Fig. 2). In water temperature of 37.5℃ only 0.5 per cent of the hatched larvae pupated and all larvae died at the first instar at 44.0℃ (Fig. 3).

N2  - While the authors were engaged in studies on mosquitoes in relation to epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis in Okayama Prefecture, western Honshu, a large number of mosquito species belonging to the subgenus Barraudius, genus Culex were collected. By comparative studies with the known species of the subgenus, the present species has been recognized most closely related to Culex (Barraudius) modestus Ficalbi, 1889; however, it differs in several morphological characters from those described by previous authors for the nominate form, especially in the structure of appendages on the subapical lobe of male genitalia. A new subspecies, Culex (Barraudius) modestus inatomii, is created, and its male, female, pupa and larva are described in this paper. The females of the present subspecies are voracious human biters. The immature stages were found in brackish water.

Yuwan-dake : Amblyomma geoemydae, A. nitidum, A. testudinarium, Boophilus microplus, Dermacentor taiwanensis, Haemaphysalis campanulata, H. flava, H. formosensis, H. hystricis, H. megaspinosa, H. pentalagi, Ixodes granulatus, I. asanumai, and Ornithodoros sawaii. The prevalences of the predominant four species, A. testudinarium, H. formosensis, H. hystricis and D. taiwanensis, might primarily depend on the existence of the wild boar, Sus riukiuanus.

N2  - The annual life cycle, and the seasonal and spatial changes in numbers and the age structure were investigated in a natural population of the smoky brown cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa S. Results obtained by the live trapping in a shed with regular intervals were as follows : 1. The largest number of cockroaches were captured in June. It seems to be due to the hatching of a vast number of nymphs and the high activity of cockroaches due to hot and humid weather in this month. 2. The seasonal change of the age structure indicated that the 'two-year life cycle' was normal in a natural population of the smoky brown cockroach, as Tsuji and Mizuno (1972) pointed out. The age structure in a overwintering population changes year to year partly because of this 'two-year life cycle', and the seasonal incidence of hatching, adult emergence etc. during successive active seasons may be roughly predictable from the age structure in the previous overwintering population. 3. The density and/or the instar composition were different from room to room and trap to trap, and these differences were clearer in young instar nymphs than old nymphs or adults. Assuming that the spatial differences in the number of insects being trapped reflects the spatial distribution in the shed, the distribution pattern was analysed by using the m^^^*-m^^^- relatioship method (Iwao, 1968). It was found that the distribution pattern was highly aggregative in all development stages. But this tendency was weakened in the following order : 1st-3rd instar nymph (β=8.0)>over 4th instar nymph (β=5.3-6.2)>adult (β=3.7). The degree of aggregation also changed seasonally. It was low in active seasons and high in inactive ones.

N2  - 1. The field survey on the tick had been made from May 1967 to the end of October 1972,at 33 points in 3 different Prefectures, Aomori, Iwate and Akita. In total of 1,005 mammals, 11 species belonging to 10 genera, were captured as the host of the tick (Table 1). A total of 584 specimens of ticks were collected from the above mammalian hosts. Ten species belonging to 2 genera and their hosts are shown in Table 2. 2. Two specimens of Ixodes sp. N1 obtained from Japanese shrew-mole were found as a new species. They have the similar features with I. persulcatus and I. sp. NB Ono, 1965. For comparison of morphological characters of these Ixodes species, I. sp. N1 may be easily distinguished from other 2 species in the shape of hypostome and scutum (Fig. 1). 3. Five human cases of tick biting were recorded from Aomori and Akita Prefectures in 1972 to 1973. In all cases, the removed ticks were identified as the adult female of Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899,which is widely and commonly parasitic on wild mammals in Tohoku (Fig. 2). Although there has been no record of this tick biting to man in Japan, and it is thought that there will be rather frequent opportunities to bite man in Tohoku area.

N2  - An ecological study was made on the larval and imaginal population of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in a cemetery of Nagoya City, central Japan, from April to November 1968. The present paper reports the larval and imaginal population dynamics from the view point of seasonal change of larval population size, larval age structure, imaginal population size and parous rate. 1) The number of mosquito larvae and pupae sampled from 3 stone basins by a bottom-screened dipper totalled, 2,182,of which 93.6% were Aedes albopictus (Skuse), 5.9% Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett and 0.5% Culex vorax Edwards. The number of adult mosquitoes captured with an aspirator was 532,of which 99.4% were A. albopictus and 0.6% Armigeres subalbatus (Coquillett). 2) Total number of A. albopictus larvae (pupae) in each stone basin was estimated by the application of the removal method (Fig. 1). To make a nearer approach to an understanding of population dynamics in the cemetery as a whole, the data of mosquito counts (x) were treated after being transformed into log (x+1), and the Williams' means were used for interpreting the seasonal changes of larval and imaginal population size. 3) The larval population occurred continuously from middle April to early November, and the population size reached its peaks three times (late April, middle July-early August, late August-middle September), of which the second peak was the largest. The imaginal population occurred from middle May to early November, and the population peaks were observed twice (late June-middle July, early to late September), the first peak being larger (Table 1 and Fig. 2). 4) It was indicated from the consecutive analysis of larval age structure that burst of adult emergence at population level seemed to occur five times (middle April-late May, middle June-early July, early July-late July, late July-late August, early Septmber-middle October) (Fig. 2). This estimation was certified by the mark-release-recapture method using Giemsa or carmine 1/1,000 solutions as marking dye (Fig. 4). 5) Each of imaginal population peaks were accompanied by the prominent increase of parous rate in early July to middle August and late September to middle October. Younger larvae appeared continuously and larval population size increased markedly around the first increase period of parous rate, but neither of such changes was observed in the second increase period (Fig. 2). This seems to indicate that eggs deposited in the second increase period of parous rate go through the winter and that the first larval generation of next year is derived from these overwintered eggs. 6) Discussion was given of the number of eggs hatching during a year in stone basins, remarkable effect given by grave-visitors on the mosquito population, and habitat segregation between A. albopictus and the allied species A. flavopictus.

N2  - Extent of pale spots on the wings of Culex mimeticus and C. orientalis from Japan, and of C. neomimulus from Taiwan, together with their wing venation was studied to determine the diagnostic value of these morphological characters. It was found that some particular pale spots in the humeral and sectoral areas are definitely good characters for diagnosis of each species. The use of wing venation for the same purpose appears to be of limited value.

N2  - Sterilizing effect of hempa was studied in relation to the ovarian development of the housefly, Musca domestica vicina Macquart. Continual treatment with low concentration of hempa below 0.02% to both sexes of the flies induced decline of hatchability of eggs laid during the treatment; decrease of egg production and complete sterility were observed by the treatment of high concentration above 0.1%. Flesh weight and follicle size of the ovary at 4 days after emergence decreased intensely by the treatment with the high concentration of hempa. Histological observations demonstrated that treatment with low concentration of hempa induced vacuolization of the ooplasm of the mature follicle, and that the high concentrations induced pycnosis and degradation of the nuclei of the nurse and follicular epithelial cells, collapse of the germarium and lack of the enlargement of the 2nd-follicles. Conspicuous vacuolization was also observed in the fat body of females. Histological changes described above indicate that the effect of hempa is, in addition to its known effect of inducing male sterility, concerned to induce sterility in female housefly.

N2  - The survival and longevity of the male and female mosquitoes of Aedes togoi were observed by feeding on the flowers of 8 woody plants and the ripe persimmons in the same manner as described in previous reports (Harada et al., 1971,1972). The flowers of an oak (Lithocarpus edulis, Fagaceae) were most effective for survival of the mosquitoes among the tested, showing 98% survivals for both sexes on the 14th feeding day. Those of snowbell (Styrax japonica, Stryaceae) and spindletree (Euonymus sieboldianus, Celastraceae) were secondarily effective, showing 70% and 75% survivals for the males, and 80% and 60% for the females on the 19th day, respectively. Other woody plants, such as eldertree (Sambucus sieboldiana, Caprifoliaceae), bush honeysuckle (Weigela coraeensis, Caprifoliaceae), sumac (Rhus javanica, Anacardiaceae), dockmackie (Viburnum dilatatum, Caprifoliaceae) and azalea (Rhododendron indicum, Ericaceae) were also fairly effective for survival of mosquitoes. Whereas, the mosquitoes fed on the ripe persimmon, which contained 11.2% sugar, had the mean life spans of 12 days in the males and 18 days in the females. Especially, about 20% of the latter group survived over 40 days. These observations show that the nectar sources of the woody plants are very useful for mosquitoes to maintain their life. The nectar imbibed by the mosquitoes was detected on the 5th and 10th feeding days by the anthrone reaction according to Van Handel (1972). More than 90% of mosquitoes were positive in both sexes when they were kept for 10 days on the flowers of snowbell, chestnut tree, oak and sumac, and more than 50% were positive on milk vetch, rape, Japanese snowflower and sorrel vine. It is said from the results that the mosquitoes were active in nectar feeding than generally being thought. The blood-engorged females which had continuously been fed on various nectar flowers laid less numbers of eggs than those fed on 10% sugar solution did, 70.8 vs 182.6,in spite of the normal development of the ovarian follicles. The high sugar contents in the nectar flowers was possibly responsible for this.

N2  - A common molecular size and shape was found among the attractive compounds when 124 alkyl carbonyl and few other types of compounds were studied for ovipositional attractancy of mosquitoes, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say. The attractive compounds were mostly in 9-atom-length and branched. A methyl branch on α carbon or an ethyl branch on γ carbon from the functional group furnished attractancy, but those on β or δ carbons did inactivity with no exception. A methyl branch on ω-1 carbon furnished the best attractancy. Regardless the types of compounds; acids, ketones or esters, those in the similar contour showed the similar levels of attractancy. The 11-or more-atom-long compounds tended to be extremely repellent. All alcohols were inactive with one exception. The compounds in beyond 24-atom-length were inactive because of the involatility.

N2  - Experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of different temperatures (27℃ and 15℃) on the behavioural interaction between two harbouring final instars and/or adults in each of four species of cockroaches, Periplaneta fuliginosa. P. americana, P. japonica, and Blattella germanica. Rectangular paper-pipes of 12cm×14cm×different heights (2cm, 1cm) or those of 3cm×2cm×different heights (1cm, 0.5cm) were used as harbourage shelters. These shelters were placed side by side in a test container and two insects of the same stage were released into the container. Each test was replicated eight or ten times. The results of the experiments can be summarized as follows. I. Periplaneta species : When tested at 27℃ with 1cm and 2cm shelters, adults, as well as final instar nymphs, tended to enter into separate shelters. At 15℃, however, they were usually found in couples in one of the two shelters, mostly in 1cm one. This suggests that the rejecting behaviour of Periplaneta species is suppressed through some mechanism under cooler conditions. II. Blattella germanica : More than 50% of adults were found in separate shelters or out of them irrespective of temperature conditions, suggesting that the harbouring behaviour of this species is different from that of the Periplaneta species.

N2  - Chironomid larvae produced the growth-retarding and toxic factors when they were kept under an extreme overcrowded condition in the laboratory. These factors were isolated with the TLC of silica gel and identified as calcium nitrite by means of IR spectroscopy. Accumulation of calcium nitrite in the ovecrowded breeding water was detrimental particularly to the younger instar larvae. Bioassay of the authentic nitrites, nitrates and the related compounds showed that ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine were also toxic to the same extent. The possible oxygen-deficient condition created by the reduction and decomposition of the accumulated nitrites and nitrates, and the methemoglobinemia caused by calcium nitrite would be responsible to the toxic and growth-retarding actions against Chironomid larvae.

N2  - The toxicity of diphacinone (2-diphenylacetyl-1,3-indandione) to rats and mice was determined for its possible use as an indirect anticoagulant rodenticide. The values of oral acute LD_<50> against the males and females of albino rat were 43.3 and 22.7mg/kg, and those against the males and females of laboratory mice were 30.0 and 28.3mg/kg, respectively. The death usually occurred in 1 to 5 days and the increased dose shortened the survival period. In the case of subacute toxicity of diphacinone against mice, 60 to 100% mortalities were obtained after the successive administrations of diphacinone baits ranging from 0.0005 to 0.02% for six days. No appreciable relationship between the mortality and the total intake dose was found in the range from 0.6 to 200mg/kg. Whereas, the subacute toxicity of diphacinone baits against the albino rats was approximately the same as that of coumatetralyl. Majorities of the mice and rats in these subacute toxicity tests died in 4 to 6 days and 4 to 7 days, respectively. The acceptance of the diphacinone baits was good in mice and rats. The oral acute and subacute toxicities of several indirect anticoagulant rodenticides were discussed in comparison.

N2  - Insecticide susceptibility of 4th instar larvae and adults of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus was studied using dipping method and topical application method. The mosquitoes of OK7 strain were reared and maintained from eggs laid by wild-caught adults in Osaka district, 1967. The following results were obtained. 1. LC_<50> of 13 insecticides were determined and may be divided into four groups as follows in descending order : 1) dursban, karphos, abate, Dowco 214 and methyl-parathion 2) fenthion, pp'-DDT and trichlorfon 3) fenitrothion, fenchlorfos, diazinon and malathion 4) γ-BHC. Gamma BHC was most inferior to above chemicals. 2. The larvae of OK7 strain were highly resistant to DDT and BHC. The LC_<50> of pp'-DDT in OK7 strain was ten times more than that of Okayama colony, and that of γ-BHC 250 times more than that of Jindaiji colony. From the data of insecticide susceptibility of C. tritaeniorhynchus summorosus larvae reported by several workers from various localities in Japan, this mosquito seems to have developed more and more resistance to DDT and BHC with years. 3. Refering to the degree of susceptibility to the organophosphorous compounds, the OK7 strain seems to stand at the medium position among the strains reported. 4. The effect of temperature on the toxicity of insecticides was tested with larvae. The toxicity of pp'-DDT and γ-BHC was showed to increase with lower temperature and that of fenitrothion and fenthion to behave reversely.

N2  - Injuries by stings of unknown agents have been reported to occur among the swimmers in the rocky seaweed-growing seashore areas of Niigata Prefecture. The stings were seen among the bathers and the seaweed-collecting divers in summer season and caused the local initial skin lesions in most cases. Usually a variety of general symptoms followed. In order to investigate the causative agent of this sting, the clinical, epidemiological studies and the toxicological experiments have been carried out since July, 1970. The results obtained so far are as follows : 1) The stings took place during the period from the middle of June to the end of August with the greatest number of cases occurring in the second and last decades of July. Most victims were under twenty years of age but the cases of the woman seaweed collectors were older. The severe cases were observed especially in these woman divers. 2) The stings occurred mainly on the skin of the trunk covered by the swimming suit. At the site of sting, usually the initial pain was present and the localized erythematous patch up to several cm in diameter followed. 3) The general symptoms consisted of severe pains in the various groups of muscles, oppression of chest, coughing, lacrimation, serous rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever etc., and in general the recovery occurred in 1 or 2 days. In severe cases the victims were sent to hospital because of severe pains and dysbasia, and had to receive approximately one week's medical attention. The same symptoms were occasionally seen by eating a kind of seaweed Nemacystus decipiens (Suringar) in raw condition. 4) The etiological investigations have been made to find out a small poisonous jellyfish in the rocky seaweed-growing locality where the victims were stung, since such clinical and epidemiological aspects seemed to refer to the sting by it. Consequently, a small jellyfish measuring 5&acd;15mm in diameter Gonionemus oshoro Uchida has been discovered in accordance with the seasonal occurrence of victims. 5) Some victims have told us to see a small jellyfish-like agent at the sting site under the swimming suit. It is also possible that such a jellyfish got between the swimming suit and the skin of trunk may result in simultaneously discharging the venom of numerous nematocysts into the skin of victims. 6) The assaying of the venom of nematocyst extracted from G. oshoro showed that some signs similar to human cases were produced when the extract was intraperitoneally inoculated into mice and guinea pigs. 7) Two Japanese monkeys showed some symptoms similar to human cases when three G. oshoro were applied to the skin of both superior palpebral regions and one side of buccal region, respectively. 8) Finally a G. oshoro was applied to the skin of the anterior cubital or medial brachial region of five volunteers, respectively, and three persons exposed produced the local and general symptoms corresponding to those mentioned above, while two remaining persons showed only a slight local symptom. 9) Other epidemiological date also have suggested that G. oshoro must be responsible for this injurious effect. The severity of the victims may be modified by sensitivity of the individual to venom, and a hypersensitivity phenomenon encountered occasionally in the woman divers could be an anaphylactic reaction produced by the recurrent stings. On the other hand, the similar symptoms observed in people who ate N. decipiens in raw condition are probably due to swallowing of G. oshoro with such a seaweed. 10) G. oshoro appears to harbor mainly in a seaweed Sargassum confusum Agardh, and it is indicated that these stings may occur widely along the rocky seaweed-growing seashore areas in northern Japan.

N2  - The harbouring behaviour of three species of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, P. japonica, and Blattella germanica, was studied experimentally using rectangular paper-pipe shelters of 12cm×4cm×different heights (2cm, 1cm, 0.5cm) or those 3cm×2cm×different heights (1cm, 0.5cm). These shelters were placed side by side in a test container. The results of the experiments can be summarized as follows. I. Periplaneta americana and P. japonica : Single adults of these species preferred the height of shelters in a descending order of 1cm>2cm>>0.5cm, but the preference of single nymphs was 0.5cm>1cm. When tested at the same time, two adults, as well as two nymphs of the 3rd to 5th instar stage, tended to enter into separate shelters. The preference of 1st instar nymphs between 1cm and 0.5cm shelters was not so clear, but 1st instar nymphs were usually found in couples in either of the two shelters. These results indicate that the harbouring behaviour of the two species is similar to that of P. fuliginosa reported before (Tsuji and Mizuno, 1972 and 1973). II. Blattella germanica : The preference of single and two insects of this species may be expressed as 0.5cm>1cm in height of the shelters. However, considerable number of tested insects were found out of the shelters, suggesting that the harbouring behaviour of this species is somewhat different from that of the other two species. When three shelters of 2cm, 1cm, and 0.5cm heights were exposed to single adults, 90% of them were out of the shelters. While 75% congregated in 0.5cm shelter when 16 adults were tested at the same time. This density-dependent harbouring and congregating behaviour of adults may not be due to interattraction between two individuals, but to conditioning effect produced density-dependently in the suitable (0.5cm height) shelter, because two adults, when tested in the same container, were usually found in separate shelters or out of them. Two 3rd to 5th instar nymphs were usually found in separate shelters or out of them too. Two 1st instar nymphs, however, tended to coexist in one of the shelters.

N2  - The investigation on the mosquito populations collected with the pig baited trap and the dry ice baited trap was carried out on the paddy field area of Natori City, Miyagi Prefecture during the three years, 1965-1967. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1. Of all the trapped specimens, more than 99 percent belonged to the unengorged females of the following five species-Culex tritaenior-hynchus summorosus, Anopheles sinensis, Culex pipiens pallens, Aedes vexans nipponii and Armigeres subalbatus. 2. The species compositions show remarkable difference between the pig baited trap and the dry ice baited trap in relative abundance of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus, Anopheles sinensis and Culex pipiens pallens. 3. After the peak of seasonal abundance the numbers of mosquitoes decrease abruptly in all the mosquito populations when sampled by the dry ice baited trap. This might be caused by the difference of the age structure of the mosquito population attracted by different kinds of baits. 4. The seasonal succession of the mosquito population structure is almost identical between both traps. However, Anopheles sinensis as dominant species in the population appears in the pig baited trap later than in the other. 5. Moreover, annually the seasonal prevalence of each species and the seasonal succession of the mosquito population structure changed considerably in the both traps.

N2  - By topical application, Hokota strains was 63 times as resistant as susceptible NAIDM strain to diazinon, and 38 times to diazoxon. Resistance of Hokota strain to diazinon, on the other hand, was about 54 times, when the insecticide was injected. Acetylcholinesterase preparations from both Hokota and NAIDM strain were affected similarly by diazinon or diazoxon, in vitro. (In)_<50> values for acetylcholiesterase of both strains were respectively 8×(10)^<-7> M to diazinon and 4×(10)^<-10> M to diazoxon. By topical application of ^<32>P-diazinon, it was revealed that diazinon penetrated the integument of NAIDM strain more rapidly than that of Hokota strain. Consequently, greater quantities of chloroform extractables were found in the susceptible flies than in the resistant flies. Diazoxon contents in chloroform extractables in Hokota and NAIDM strain were 0.3 and 6.4%, respectively, which were equivalent to 0.20 and 8.77mμg/fly, 1 hr after topical application of 1μg/fly diazinon. The higher diazoxon level in susceptible strain, which was immediate cause of death in susceptible flies, seems to depend partly on rapid diazinon penetration through the integument, but mainly on the other mechanisms, such as lower rate of degradation of the insecticide.

N2  - We have evaluated lethal activity of 19 synthetic juvenile hormone analogues against of Culex pipiens pallens. All tests were conducted in 300ml glass vessels containing 200ml of water provided with a small amount of food. Thirty of 3rd or 4th instar larvae were introduced into each vessles. Tested juvenile hormone analogues were mixed with 30% of a emulsifier, and certain amount of the mixture was added into the vessels to make emulsions with known concentration of JH analogues. The number of dead larvae and pupae were recorded daily until all test insects have emerged out. All compounds tested were characterized by their inhibition of pupation and adult development, but not by toxicological kill. With many compound tested at 10ppm a high percentage of the larvae gave rise to abnormal pupae resulting in their death. Compounds No. 17 and 19 were most effective in blocking adult development of the 4th instar larvae, giving (LC)_<50>'s as 0.04 and 0.03ppm respectively. The results are of special interest to control the mosquito larvae which has become resistant to all conventional insecticides, and as the alternative control agent of the conventional insecticides in respect of enviromental pollution.

N2  - The insecticidal activity of Dowco[○!R] 214,O, O-dimethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2 pyridyl) phosphorothioate, against the common house fly, Musca domestica vicina Macq., was compared to certain public health insecticides under laboratory conditions of 25±1℃ and 60±5% R.H. The effectiveness of Dowco 214 from topical application, dry film contact and exposure to vapour was superior to that of fenitrothion. Excellent results were also obtained in the knockdown effectiveness using a settling mist apparatus, and on persistency with plywood panel tests. Dowco 214 is one of the most promising insecticides for controlling insects of public health importance because of its higher insecticidal activity, longer residual effectiveness and lower toxicity to mammals compared to other compounds being used.

N2  - Evaluation tests of the insecticidal activity of a new organophosphorus insecticide, Dowco[○!R] 214,O, O-dimethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphorothioate, against the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, Culex pipiens pallens and Anopheles sinensis were carried out under the laboratory condition of 25±1℃ and 60±5% R. H. The effectiveness of Dowco 214 to larvae and pupae evaluated by dipping test was superior to that of fenitrothion. By the settling mist method, the knockdown effect of Dowco 214 to adults of A. aegypti was excellent. Dowco 214 showed long residual effect to pupae in tap and filthy water. It is presumed that Dowco 214 is one of the promising insecticides for mosquito control.

N2  - An experiment was carried out to observe the nutritional requirements of Dermatophagoides farinae for efficient breeding. The breeding mode of D. farinae with 27 kinds of diet was compared with the control, composed of equal amout of dried yeast and powdered fish, which has been used for maintaining the mites in our laboratory. Approximately 800 mites were inoculated on 20g of the above series of diet, and they were kept at 25℃ and 60% R.H. The mites in 0.5g of the culture media were counted every two weeks by the saturated saline floatation method. Higher reproduction was observed in four kinds of diet than control : (1) 5% of lard plus fatless control (the fats being extracted thereof, and 5% of lard being added) produced the highest count 9,930 in 18 weeks; (2) 5% salad-oil plus fatless control, 8,085 in 18 weeks; (3) dried yeast and bean-flour (1 : 1), 4,110 in 22 weeks : (4) driedyeast and egg-albumin (1 : 1), 2,935 in 22 weeks; while the control, 2,595 in 18 weeks. It is assumed that fats, especially animal fats in the diet, might contain some substance to meet nutritional requirement for this species. As source of protein any of powered fish, bean-flour, and egg-albumin was satisfactory to breed this species.

N2  - It seems worth to record newly introduced cockroach species from faunal as well as pestcontrol point of view. During recent years the following three Blattellid species were found in our faunal limits. 1. Supella longipalpa (Fab.)(=spellectilium Serville) This well-known tropical pest was found in 1969 in the houses of Chichijima of the Bonin Islands. 2. Lobopterella dimidiatipes (Bolivar) This soil-surface cockroach has been known from many Pacific Islands. In Japanese territory it was first discovered by Prof. R. Kano in 1955 in Iriomote Island, the Yayeyama-group of the Ryukyus. Then, from the other Ryukyu Islands, i.e., Okinawa, Miyako, Ishigaki by my colleagues and myself. There are also specimens from Yang-ming-shan, near Taipei and Kuraru, southern Taiwan, the latter taken by Dr. Chu. 3. Imblattella panamae (Hebard) This is an indigenous Panamanian species. In recent years many individuals were detected from the pots of tropical orchids. In Tokyo area this cockroach is said to be not uncommon in the greenhouses where tropical orchids are cultivated, probably imported directly from Central America, or indirectly, from nurseries of orchids or tropical plants in the other part of the world. A brief description for each species were given together with illustrations of taxonomic characters.

N2  - Aedes (Finlaya) savoryi Bohart, 1956 was described by the original author from eight females. In 1969 and in 1971,the present authors discovered its larvae and pupae in seaside rock-pools in Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands. The present paper deals with the descriptions of the male, pupa and larva of Aedes savoryi which heretofore were unknown. As pointed out by Bohart, females possessed characters of subgroup III, group H of subgenus Finlaya proposed by Knight & Marks (1952). But male genitalia of this species lacked the "tuft" of specialized scales, which was the key character of subgroup III. The pupa and larva of this species were similar in structure to those of Aedes togoi. The pupa of the former could be distinguished from that of the latter in that the paddle without spicules was provided with two apical hairs. In larva, the number of teeth on mental plate was from 21 to 25 in A. savcryi and from 29 to 37 in A. togoi. This species is indigenous to the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands and breeds in the brackish water rock-pools only. The blood sucking activity was highest at sunset and sunrise, but attacked man during the day as well.

N2  - Investigation of the fauna of medically important animals in the southern Amami-Island was done from September 1971,mainly around Mt. Yuwan, and the results of the (annual) investigation on trombiculid mites are presented here. 1. Unengorged larvae were mainly collected from the soil. 12 genera and 27 species were identified, among which 13 species have been known, while the others are considered to be new species. Descriptions of the new species are to be reported in another paper. 2. Genus Schoengastia which has not previously been reported from Japan, and many other species which destributed in South East Asia were found. 3. Existence of Leptotrombidium scutellare, the main vector species of Tsutsugamushi-disease on the Izu seven islands and in some parts of the main land of Japan, was found. 4. 7 genera, 18 species were found from the nest hole of Amami-hare, Pentalagus furnessi (Stone, 1900), the most important host of trombiculid mites. 5. Several species of trombiculid mites are considered to be specific parasites of Amami-hare. Most of the species of trombiculid mites were found at Mt. Yuwan, where primeval forests and the conservation of the natural environment protect Amami-hare and other small animals, which are hosts of these mites. 6. Four species of trombiculid mites, which had usually been found from birds, were collected from soil in the breeding habitats of sea birds.

N2  - In this paper was reported the results of my survey on the medical insects, excluding flies, made chiefly in the Chichi-jima in the Ogasawara Islands (Bonin Islands) from August 1968 to October 1969. 1. Seven species of the mosquitoes were found to be distributed in Ogasawara Islands : Aedes savoryi, Aedes togoi, Aedes albopictus, Ades sp. I, Culex boninensis, Culex pipiens fatigans and Culex vorax. 2. Larvae and pupae of Aedes savoryi were collected from rock pool of sea coast at southern edge of Chichi-jima. Since the rearing of them in the laboratory were succeeded, the morphology of this species in immature stage and in male adult, which had been unknown, were observed. The blood sucking activity of females against men was also found to be very intensive outdoors in the day light. 3. Females of Aedes sp. I were caught by biting collections. But these in adult male or in immature stage were not found. 4. Among these seven species collected in this work three species of Aedes savoryi, Aedes sp. I and Culex boninensis which seemed to be peculiar to this Islands were quite unknown in epidemiologic significance. 5. In Chichi-jima Aedes albopictus were predominant in the thick forests and Culex pipiens fatigans in the proximity to human habitations. Both species, however, were not active in winter (January and February). 6. Aedes aegypti, known to have been distributed in large number in Ogasawara Islands, were not found at all during this work. 7. In Chichi-jima six species of the Cockroach were found. Blattella germanica, Blattella lituricollis, Onychostylus vilis, Periplaneta americana, Periplaneta australasiae and Supella supellectillium were collected in human houses, and two species of Blattella lituricollis and Pycnoscelus surinamensis in the field. In Iwo-jima Pycnoscelus surinamensis was collected in the field. 8. Blattella lituricollis were said to be found on the grass land around the human habitations. Only one specimens was collected coming to the light of a room at night. 9. Onychostylus vilis was the most abundant species as well as Periplaneta americana in the human houses of Chichi-jima. 10. Supella supellectillium was found first in our country. 11. In Chichi-jima Polyplax spinulosa was collected from Rattus rattus caught with alive-rattrap, and Ctenocephalides felis from dogs and cats. 12. Culicoides claggi Tokunaga, (1959) had already been recorded in the Island, but no specimen was found during the present work.

N2  - The overcrowding factors of Chironomid larvae were proved in the cultures by breeding them in various numbers in a constant bottom area and in a constant number in various area. The factors delayed the midge emergence and decreased the emergence-rates significantly in both the factor-producing water and the conditioned water. The higher the larval density in the factor-producing phase, the more the midge emergence was delayed and dispersed. There were the linear regression between the logs of larval densities and the probits of emergence-rates in both factor-producing and bioassay phases. The production of growth-retarding and toxic factors was dependent on the larval density rather than the number of larvae in the culture.

N2  - An ecological study was made on the larval population of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in a cemetery of Nagoya City, central Japan, during a period from June to December, 1967. The present paper reports the larval population dynamics in natural habitat from the view point of seasonal change of population size and age structure. 1) The number of mosquito larvae and pupae sampled from 10 stone basins by a dipper totalled 2,090 during the study period. Most of them (97%) were A. albopictus, and the rest were Culex pipiens pallens, C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. orientalis in decreasing order. 2) Statistical analyses were made of the relationship between mean and variance of A. albopictus larval (pupal) counts in the 10 stations, and it was revealed that distribution of individuals seemed to be contagious and to fit well to the negative binomial distributions with a common k except a few cases (Figs. 3,4 and Table 2). The log(x+1) transformation was adopted in order to normalize the data (x : individual counts per stone basin) according to Bartlett (1947), and the Williams' means (Williams, 1937) were used to represent the seasonal change of population size and age structure of the larval population in the cemetery as a whole. 3) The larval population was observed from late June to late November, and the population size reached its peaks three time (early July, early August and early September), of which the peak in early August being the largest (Fig. 5). 4) Consecutive analysis of larval age structure indicated that adult emergence at population level seemed to occur about three times (late June-mid July, late July-early September, mid Septembermid October) roughly in parallel with the above-mentioned population peaks. Judging from the largest population size and continuous adult productivity in larval population, emerging adults were estimated to be most abundant at the second emergence period (Fig. 5). 5) There were appreciable differences in seasonal fluctuation pattern of the larval population size between the two representations : one was expressed by arithmetic mean of actual individual counts and the other by the Williams' mean (Fig. 5). So, a comparison was made between the arithmetic mean of actual individual numbers and that of log-transformed ones in regard to frequency distribution and variability of the observed counts. As a result, the log-transformed numbers seemed to be more suitable for analyzing dynamics of mosquito population in a habitat area as a whole, because the arithmetic means of the log-transformed numbers were more centrally located and the coefficients of variation of them were more minimized (Figs. 6,7).

N2  - It has been reported in our previous studies that a fresh water fish of the family Poeciliidae, the guppy or Poecilia reticulata (Peters), has established in a number of areas in Asia after being introduced from South America as a pet fish, and served as an efficient predator of mosquito larvae in sewage waters. The fish was found also to be highly adapted for breeding in polluted waters and effective in cleaning organic matters and microoganisms. In this connection, studies were made on the tolerance of the guppies to the septic pollution of water and for identification of the cause of the toxicity. When 5g of the powder of laboratory animal food is added to 10 liters of water and kept at 23℃, the dissolved oxygen in water becomes undetectable within several hours; the guppies, however, released in such water can survive many days apparently by taking oxygen from the water surface. The absence of dissolved oxygen is therefore not the direct cause of the death of the guppies, though it may be fatal to other fish species. When larger amounts of the septic substance is added to water, such as over 10g of the animal food into 10 liters of water, the water becomes toxic to the guppies after about 4 days, and the toxicity lasts for about a week. However, the guppies exposed to the water before and after such a toxic period stays apparently healthy, though the dissolved oxygen may be undetectable. Interestingly enough, the guppies which survive keep on eating the fouling substances and the microorganisms, and eventually the water recovers its oxygen content after most of the organic matter is consumed by the guppies. The toxicity of septic waters to the guppies was found to be highly correlated with the concentration of H_2S in water. The water becomes fatal to the fishes from about the fourth day when the H_2S concentration increases to over 1ppm, and remains so for about a week until the concentration drops again to below 2ppm. The pH level during this period is usually below 6,but it gradually changes to near neutral in connection with the increase of NH_3 in the water. The septic water also becomes non-toxic to the fishes after providing aeration for a few hours. Under experimental conditions, H_2S dissolved in distilled water exhibits toxicity to the fishes at concentrations higher than 1ppm, while the toxicity of ammonia in water is seen at concentrations above 11ppm. It was also observed that the toxicity of H_2S and NH_3 is remarkably reduced by mixing the two solutions at adecuate ratios. The solution of (NH_4)_2S is safe to the fishes even at 63ppm, and becomes toxic only at concentrations 125ppm and higher. It is presumed that the accumulation of H_2S produced by microorganisms under anaerobic condition is the principal cause of the toxicity, and subsequent increase of ammonia in water acts as a neutralizing agent. It was further observed that the toxicity to the fishes could be easily minimized by providing aeration into the septic waters in connection with the recovery of dissolved oxygen. The D.O. concentration of the septic water rapidly increases after commencement of the aeration, but in most cases the concentration starts to drop after several hours, probably the result of the reproduction of aerobic microorganisms which consume oxygen for oxidizing the fouling substances. The secondary increase of D.O. concentration occurs some time later, after most of the septic substances are saturated with oxygen.

N2  - The onchocerciasis is one of the most important diseases of human in Ethiopia. From the epidemiological point of view there is apparently much remained to be investigated on the ecology of the vector, the black flies. In this study the biting habit of the black fly, Simulium damnosum, against man was observed particularly on the diurnal fluctuation of the biting activity. The biting collections were carried out in two types of places, namely the sunny places and the shady places. It was noticed that in the sunny places the flies began to come attacking man with the rise in temperature and illumination intensity in the morning but then the number of flies decreased according to the sudden increase in the intensity of illumination. So there appeared a peak in the activity around 9 : 00 hours a.m. There was also a peak observed in the afternoon at about 5 : 00p.m. It can be concluded that the biting activity of this fly has a bipeaked fluctuation picture in the daytime, one peak in the morning and another in the afternoon. However in the shady places where no remarkable fluctuation in the illumination intensity occurred no obvious peaks in the activity could be observed.

N2  - The survey on the thelazian parasites and their intermediate hosts was made in the farm of National Institute of Animal Industry in Chiba city from January 1972 to May 1973. Four genera and 6 species, totalling 9,097 flies were obtained from cattle bodies and Musca hervei was dominant (63%). Among the collected flies, some of Musca hervei and Musca bezzii were infected with thelazian larvae, and 93% of them were females of M. hervei. Interest result of this survey was a discovery of thelazian larvae in males of M. hervei. Krastin (1950) supposed that the larvae invade into the follicle of ovary and develope therein. However, Vilagiova (1962) found larvae of T. gulosa in fat tissue of male and ovarian follicle of female in M. autumnalis and supposed the similar relationship also in T. rhodesi and T. skrjabini. The authors could not observe the larvae in the follicles, but found tunicate larvae adhering to the wall of body cavity in both sexes of M. hervei. On the origin of this tunica is a problem in future. Month of maximum infected rate both in the flies and cattle eyes was October. The transmission of thelazian larvae to the eyes of cows by flies was continued from spring until late fall. Adult parasites are kept in the eyes of cows during the winter and new infection of larvae to the flies begins at the same time with emerging of the overwintered flies. New infection of infectious larvae to the eyes of cows begins in the middle of May, because newly infected larvae from cows to flies in early spring take more than 50 days to develope to the infectious larvae.

N2  - In previous paper, the author reported that 30℃ and 85% R.H. were most suitable condition for the formation of hypopus as well as the reproduction of Lardoglyphus konoi observed as total counts of the whole mites in each stage. The present study was made to observe the mode of breeding and hypopus formation of L. konoi in various kinds of diet from which supposed nutrient substances were reduced. These substances were obtained from fish meal and dried yeast powder which were treated respectively with water (at 5℃ for 24hr), boiling water (at 100℃ for 24hr), ethanol or acetone (at 5℃ for 7 days). Two groups of diet were prepared with the above residue as follows : (1) mixture of dried yeast powder and residue of fish meal treated with various kinds of solvent at ratio of 6 : 4,(2) mixture of fish meal and residue of dried yeast powder treated with various kinds of solvent at ratio of 4 : 6. Initially 300 mites were inoculated on 10g of the diet. They were kept at 30℃ and 85% R.H. regulated with saturated KCl solution. On any kinds of diet with the residue of fish meal, total count of mites in each stages was low while the ratio of the hypopus formation was higher in general. Total count of the mites was low on the diet, mixture of untreated fish meal and residue of dried yeast powder extracted with boiling water, while the ratio of the hypopus formation was the highest. Number of the mites was high on the diet, mixture of untreated fish meal and residue of dried yeast powder extracted with water at 5℃, whereas hypopus ratio showed next to the above. The highest count of the mites was observed on the diet; untreated fish meal and yeast powder which was dried and reground after soaking in to boiling water for 24hr, but the hypopus ratio was low.

N2  - Insecticidal activities of Dowco-214,O, O-dimethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl) phosphorothioate, against the German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana L., and the smoky brown cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa L., were evaluated under a laboratory condition of 25±1℃ and 60±5% R.H. The (LD)_<50>'s for male adults of the German cockroach determined by topical application decreased in order of dichlorvos, Dowco-214,fenitrothion, Dursban, fenthion, diazinon, dieldrin and malathion. At the level of (LD)_<90>, Dowco-214 was most effective. For male adults of the American cockroach, the (LD)_<50>'s decreased in order of dichlorvos, Dursban, Dowco-214,fenitrothion, diazinon and fenthion. In the test using male adults of the smoky brown cockroach, Dursban was most effective and the (LD)_<50>'s decreased in order of fenitrothion, diazinon and Dowco-214. However, the differences of toxicities between Dowco-214,fenthion and fenitrothion were not significant. Residual effectiveness of Dowco-214 on plywood panel tested by the limited time contact method was longer than that of several insecticides. In the test by the succesive time contact method, effective persistence of Dowco-214 on plywood panel was longer than that of Dursban and diazinon. It is presumed that Dowco-214 is one of the most promising insecticides for controlling insects of public health importance because of its higher insecticidal activity, longer residual effectiveness and lower toxicity to mammals.

N2  - A simplified technique was devised for the analysis of various sugars in adult mosquitoes. The sugar meal in the diverticulum of mosquitoes was applied directly on a filter (Toyo No. 51 A) and the ordinary one-dimensional paper-partition chromatography was carried out with standard sugar solutions. The results obtained by this simplified method were as acurate as that obtained by the previously reported and more complicated ones, by homogenizing the samples, concentrating it and developing on the filter paper. Moreover, the procedure is very simple and many samples can be tested within a short period of time, and thus it can probably be used to the field experiments. Employing this procedure, sugar preference tests were carried out with Culex pipiens pallens and C.p. molestus. Lactose was least preferred among the sugars examined and there was no significant difference in preference among fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltose. It was also observed that the hydrolysis of sugars began 3 hours after the intake. Detection of disaccharide become almost impossible 4 hours after the intake and sugars disappeared after 8 hours indicating the complete digestion and absorption of these sugars.

N2  - In order to ascertain the feeding preferences of the Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, on some unexperienced baits, the breeding and feeding tests were conducted under laboratory conditions. The animals used were a laboratory colony of Norway rats which had been reared with a particular simple bait from childhood to maturity. The bait adopted were commercially available wheat flour, ground peanut fish meal, crushed sweet potato, and powdered rat food (bait for rearing experimental animals). In the test, the criterion of preference was based on comparing the amount of consumption of different kinds of baits set at the same time in each test cage. As shown in the results, there were significant differences in the amount of consumption among the test baits. Raw sweet potato and ground peanut were marked by more preferable than the other baits. It is of interest that raw sweet potato was highly preferred by the rats whether the rat had experience in eating it or not. The growth of test animals in various tests were also observed. The rats reared with a rat food, a ground peanut, or a fish meal were in very good health, whereas the rats reared with a sweet potato were so poor health that a few rats could hardly survive. From the result obtained, it may be considered that the preferences of Norway rats for a particular bait depends upon its flavour more than its nutritional content or the previous dietary experience.

After making procise examinations of the specimens belonging to the P. hirtipes-group of all stages collected from several localities of Japan, it was ascertained that the all of specimens, which have been regarded as P. hirtipes (Fries, 1824) since 1954,were distinctly separable from those of P. hirtipes s. str. from Northern Europe. The names P. kiotoense Shiraki 1935 and P. jezonicum (Matsumura, 1931), which had been adopted for Japanese specimens, were both resurrected basing on significant differences observed between specimens collected from Kyoto and those from Hokkaido.

Their shape, size and chorionic fine sculpturings were illustrated and described. The description of the eggs of Aedes nobukonis is new. The results show that the shape, size and chorionic sculpturings provide specific characteristics for identification except for three species belonging to subgenus Stegomyia, Aedes aegypti, albopictus and flavopictus, which have striking similarities in their appearances and fine structures on the surface.

N2  - It has been reported that the guppy Poecilia reticulata is an effective predator of mosquito larva. This paper describes the results of studies particularly with respect to predation efficiency under laboratory conditions. Observations were made on the predatory activity of guppies on pupae, as well as on larvae. These studies were carried out in order to develop more effective utilization of the guppy for Culex pipiens control. Two guppies were placed in each aquarium containing two liters of water and maintained at constant laboratory temperature of 26℃ and 600 lux illumination. Known numbers of larvae were introduced into each aquarium at 10 : 00 am every morning. The number of larvae eaten within a two-hour period increased when the prey population increased from 50 to 100. However, the number of larvae eaten was more or less constant when the prey population was more than 100. For example, when 50 larvae were given, the number consumed was about 17.7; when 100 larvae were given, about 23.1 larvae were eaten; when 300,or more, larvae were given, about 23-24 larvae were also consumed. Similar results were obtained when 0.7g of powdered laboratory animal food was introduced into each container along with the mosquito larvae. The number of larvae eaten by the guppies under condition of high larvae population plus the powdered food did not show any significant difference as compared with the number of larvae consumed at high larval density and without the powdered laboratory food. It was observed that when the guppy population was increased and the larvae supplied were at the ratio of 50 larvae/guppy, there were more larvae consumed per guppy under high guppy population than under lower guppy population. The relationship between the number eaten per guppy (y) and the population of guppy (x) is shown by the formula y=0.432x+10.683. When prey density of each container is constant the relationship does not follow as shown in the above formula, since the number of larvae eaten per guppy decreases when the guppy population is high. Guppy attacks mosquito pupae actively when the guppy population is high. Many pupae were killed during a 24-hour period when both guppies and pupae were contact in a container, although any external injury was not found on pupal skin.

N2  - Experiments were carried out with two guppies in each of 200 liter tanks placed outdoors under natural summer condition of Tokyo; water temperature was around 25-27℃. There was a control tank for each of the above experimental tanks. Five egg rafts of Culex pipiens pallens were given each morning for seven days. Each egg raft contained an average of 249 eggs. It was observed that guppies pecked at and ate the rafts; the number eaten was estimated at three rafts per day. Some of the larvae had hatched from the eggs, but it was difficult to estimate the number which did because of their small size. In any case, no larvae were found on the eighth morning. In order to determine the number of larvae of different developmental stages which was eaten per day, various stage of larvae were introduced in each tank. When 2,000 larvae, which had recently hatched from egg were supplied, it was noted that 369 of them had pupated after six to ten days. In the control tank wherein there were no guppies 1,614 larvae survived and pupated. It was estimated that 386 of the original 2,000 larvae in the control tank died naturally. If one assumes that an approximately equal number of larvae will die naturally in the experimental tank, then the actual number of larvae consumed was estimated at 1,245,or (2,000-369)-(2,000-1,614), during the larval period. When 500 larvae of age three days after hatching were supplied in the same way as mentioned above, the number of larvae eaten was estimated at 249 larvae by the end of the pupation period; under similar conditions, 142 four-day larvae were consumed; 50 five-day larvae; and 35 six-day were eaten. From the above the number of larvae eaten per day was calculated in the case of 0 to two days old larvae as : (1245-249)/3=332 larvae. In the same way, 107 three-day old larvae, 92 four-day old and 15 five-day old larvae were eaten per day. When a mixed-age population of larvae were supplied, the number eaten was greater in younger-aged larvae than older ones. However, some older ones were always eaten in spite of the presence of young larvae still remaining in the tank, although the number of older larvae consumed was less in comparison when a homogeneous age-group population was available.

N2  - Four tanks, labeled A, B, C, and D, containing 750 liters of water, were placed outdoors near the laboratory. Breeding of Culex pipiens pallens was found in each tank in early June, 1972. Twenty guppies, or 10 mature pairs, were introduced in two of the tanks, B and C, on 9 June 1972. Tank B was then treated with fenitrothion 1ppm, tank C remained untreated. Tank D was treated with fenitrothion 1ppm on the same day, and tank A, the control tank, received neither guppies nor fenitrothion. The observation for each tank was conducted using a ladle to count the larvae and pupae densities every two or three days. Also counts of total number of egg rafts on the water surface were made on the same day. These observations were made until the end of September. According to the results, the larvae and pupae dramatically disappeared on the fourth day after fenitrothion treatment in both tanks B and D. In the case of tank D, the chemical treatment had to be repeated five times during a two-month period due to the outbreak of larvae every 10 or 20 days. Tank B, however, received no additional chemical treatment after the initial treatment because of the presences of the guppies. A number of pupae was observed for three weeks after introduction of guppies to tank C, but all pupae had disappeared by the end of this period. More than 100 rafts a day of oviposition were observed in tanks A and D. However, no rafts were recognized from tanks B and C, except for very few days during the peak time of oviposition activity of mid-summer. As Part II of the present report series showed, these egg rafts were eaten by guppies in each tank. Thus, in tanks B and C no adult mosquitoes emerged throughout the summer season.

N2  - During the period from April 1971 to March 1972,a study was made on the seasonal change of composition rate of autogenous Culex pipiens molestus (Cpm) and anautogenous C.p. pallens (Cpp) in an underground room of a building in the midtown area of Nagoya City, central Japan. (1) For differentiating Cpm females from Cpp, the following five characters were used : Ommatidial number of the compound eye (square value of average number per row : x_1) and the following ratios of the various parts of wing, namely, Rc/Mc ratio (x_2), WL/Rs ratio (x_3), P/D ratio (x_4) and Rc/Rs ratio (x_5). On the bases of the discriminant values calculated using the discriminant function, Z_5=x_1-1.207 x_2+0.1953 x_3-28.99 x_4-3.322 x_5,mosquitoes with the smaller discriminant values than the critical point (25.24) were regarded as Cpm and those with the larger values as Cpp. As a result, most of the discriminant values were less than the critical point and the modes of them were within the range of 16.1 to 22.0; this suggested that most of the female mosquitoes collected with a light trap in the building seemed to be Cpm (Fig. 1). (2) A small number of these specimens, however, were considered to be Cpp, judging from their larger discriminant values. These Cpp mosquitoes were obtained mainly during spring to autumn, when their field populations usually prevailed in this district. Monthly rates of Cpp females were highest (ca. 10%) in midsummer, but the annual rate was as low as about 2% (9/480) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). (3) The number of female Cpm mosquitoes collected in the building, as compared with that of male, was predominantly larger in the monthly catch during the summer. So that, the monthly intermixing rate of Cpp was seemingly low in females, but considerably higher in males during the summer season (Table 2 and Fig. 2). (4) A confirmatory test was made as follows in order to put the discriminat function to the practical use. The above-mentioned function (Z_5) was used only for the indistinguishable specimens (0.8%) which had the transformed ommatidial numbers between 67.52 (8.22/row=1% lower rejection limit for Cpp) and 73.30 (8.56/row=1% upper rejection limit for Cpm). The result thus reached was proved to be the same as that obtained from the calculation for all the specimens under study.

N2  - An experiment was carried out to observe the effects of temperature and humidity on the reproduction of the mite Dermatophagoides farinae on a culture medium composed of the mixture of the equal amount of dried yeast and fish meal. Approximately 900 mites were inoculated into each of 16 glass container (50ml beaker) containing 25g of the mite food, and were preserved separately in dessicators regulated at different levels of relative humidity by the use of saturated solution of 4 kinds of salts (75-77% with NaCl, 60-68% with NH_4NO_3,55-58% with NaHSO_4,and 39-41% with K_2CO_3). The containers were further kept in incubators regulated at the temperatures of 20℃, 25℃, 30℃, and 35℃, each 4 dessicators with different humidity levels in the same incubator. The population density of the mite was measured at weekly intervals by counting the number of mites recovered with the saturated saline floatation method from 0.5g of the culture media. As shown in Table 3 almost no growth of the mite population was observed in media kept at 20℃ and 35℃, while more or less remarkable reproduction was seen at the temperature of 25℃ and 30℃ so far as the relative humidity was adequate, i. e. at 60% or 57-58%. In general, the speed of reproduction was faster at 30℃ than at 25℃, but higher population density was reached at 25℃ than at 30℃ in relation to the elapse of time. The maximum mite count observed at 25℃ and 57% RH was 4,800 after 23 weeks, that at 25℃ and 60% RH was 4,460 after 13 weeks and 5,665 after 23 weeks, that at 30℃ and 60% RH was 2,445 after 11 weeks. Almost no increase in the population density was observed at the relative humidity of 75-77%. In general, it has been observed that the reproduction of Dermatophagoides farinae in the culture media is considered to be slower but persists longer than that of Tyrophagus putrescentiae, and that the former is adapted to breed at lower relative humidity than the latter.

N2  - The author has previously discussed the method of sampling Culex pipiens fatigans in houses by hand collection with some aspects of resting behaviour of the mosquitoes in Ceylon (Kurihara, 1970). Following the previous report, the pattern of spatial distribution of the resting adults in daytime was analysed statistically. The data examined were of mosquito collections at nine sections or house groups, 60 houses per section, in Peliyagoda town, and 10 sections, 45 houses each, in Kelaniya town. As a result, the mean value of numbers collected per house in each section is always less than the variance. The frequency distribution of the mosquitoes is not random but over dispersion (Fig. 1). It fits well with the theoretical distribution of the negative binomial. According to the Bliss & Owen's (1958) method, a common k of the negative binomial distribution for all the section samples was calculated in the two towns respectively. Then the relationship between the mean number of mosquitoes per house (x^^^-) and the per cent of mosquito-free houses (P_0) was studied. Observed values were plotted on a graph (Fig. 3) following the formula P_0=(1+x^^^-/k)^<-k>. It is found that the mean number of mosquito of the towns can be estimated from the per cent of mosquito free houses.

N2  - A joint study was conducted for a period over one year on the ecology of the guppy, Lebistes reticulatus Peters, which was discovered in the autumn of 1970 to be breeding in highly polluted water of Yoshikawa River running through the heart of Chiba City neighbouring Tokyo. Being a tropical fish of the family Poecilidae native of South America, the guppy is known widely as a popular aquarium fish, and also as an efficient natural enemy of mosquitoes that breed in sewage waters. Previous observations in Japan have shown that the fish cannot survive outdoors over the freezing temperature during the winter season, but has established as wild colonies in sewage ditches in several hotspring areas, where the water temperature is maintained above 15℃ throughout the year. Yoshikawa is a small river of about 8km in length and 0.2/1,000 in the average slope. The upstream takes sewage water of public housing areas built in the outskirt of the city, and on the spot just before the river flows into the city a large quantity of underground water pumped up from natural gas wells is discharged continuously into the river. The well water has the temperature of about 30℃, and keeps the water temperature of its downstream not lower than 20℃ even during the winter season. The guppies were found to be breeding along the full length of the river during the summer season from July to October, but their distribution became restricted during the winter season to only the downstream of the natural gas well, or in the range where the water temperature was higher than 17℃. Seasonal observations of the chemical, physical and biological characters of the river water were carried out at three stations, at least four times a year. At the Station 2 located about 100m downstream of the inflow of the well-water, and at the Station 1 located 1.5km further downwards and in the business area of the city, the water temperature remained above 20℃ throughout the year and other chemical and biological characters were kept almost constant in these observations. The chlorine contents of samples collected from these stations were always very high due to the mixture of about the same amount of the well water showing the salinity as high as the sea water, but excellent reproduction of the guppies were seen in this zone. At the Station 3 located upstream of the well, the water temperature varied from the lowest of 11.5℃ during the winter season to the highest of 26.6℃ in the summer, and the guppies were found in these upstream zones only when the temperature was above 17.5℃. Results of both chemical and biological analysis of the water samples have shown that the river water was highly polluted, with BOD values from 6.5 to 20.7ppm and with the biological system of either beta-polysaprobic or alpha-mesosaprobic. The biological character of Station 1 and 2 remained fairly constant throughout the year, being beta-polysaprobic in the former and alpha-mesosaprobic in the latter, but that of the upstream zone at Station 3 was alpha-mesosaprobic during the summer season and beta-polysaprobic in winter in connection with the scanty rainfall of this season. It is a biologically interesting fact that a South American tropical fish is breeding enormously in a sewage ditch running through a modern city of the temperate zone, highly adapted to pollution of the water. In connection with the recent discovery by a group of Japanese scientists that the guppies are useful in the biological control of some mosquitoes and in the treatment of sewage waters, the ample supply of the fish from this natual breeding place located near Tokyo has made subsequent studies on this line much easier than before.

N2  - The morphological characteristics in the terminal part of abdomen of Periplaneta fuliginosa (Serville) were studied from the newly emerged first instar nymph through the whole developing stages until adults. Except the first instar nymphs which were obtained escaping from the oothecae the specimens used for the present observations were collected by the bait traps set in a building. The morphological changes which took places during the course of developing could be traced into two directions, that is, one to female adult and another to male adult. The presence and the developing of a notch at the middle of hind margin of the ninth abdominal sternite as well as the styli growing on the ninth sternite, and the striking development of the seventh sternite were noticed in the specimens developing to females. With the specimens growing to males no notch was observed at the margin of the ninth sternite and either the eighth, the ninth sternites or the styli remained unreduced while developing. These characteristic features enabled the sexing of cockroach through the whole developing stages.

N2  - The powers of survival of 4 species of cockroaches under a low temperature of 5.5±0.5℃ were investigated. No any stage of Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica could tolerate the chilling treatment of 40 days. Nymphs of older instars of P. fuliginosa survived for 90 days and some oothecae for more than 80 days under the chilling treatment, when given an exposure to 15±1℃ beforehand. Most of nymphs and adults of P. japonica tolerated the chilling treatment for more than 90 days with the preliminary exposure. These results suggest that P. americana and B. germanica hardly survive the coldest 3 months outdoors or in unheated buildings in Central Japan, whereas P. fuliginosa and P. japonica tolerate the winter under outdoor conditions.

N2  - The effects of feeding nematodes to the mite, Macrocheles muscaedomesticae were observed under the laboratory conditions on its predatory efficiency for house fly eggs and also on its reproduction rate. A free-living nematode, Rhabditis elongata originally isolated from a pig manure was used in the experiments. It was shown that the more feeding of nematodes on the mite caused the less destruction of fly eggs by the mite. However the reproduction rate of the mite was remarkably enhanced by the feeding of nematodes.

N2  - Larvicidal effects of some organophosphorus insecticides against the larvae of the biting midge, Culicoides circumscriptus KIEFFER, were tested at the tideland of Lake Saroma, Hokkaido. The insecticides used in this test were ABATE 5% emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and 1% granule (GR), Dursban 5% EC and 3% GR and Dowco-214 10% EC and 3% GR. In this field test, Dowco-214 was the most effective. There were little larvae at 35 days after treatment of Dowco-214 EC and GR when applied at the rate of 50mg and 90mg of active ingredients per square meter respectively. Application of Dursban 5% EC was fairly effective. Effect of ABATE against the larvae of this species was insufficient. In spite of dosage as much as 120mg per m^2 applied, heavy infestation of the larvae was ovserved as before. In mid-summer, vertical distribution of the larvae in the mud was observed. The majority of the larvae was found from the mud close to the tideland surface, and there were little larvae below the depth of 2cm.

N2  - Laboratory tests were carried out on several single dose and anticoagulant rodenticides as a tracking powder against white mice and rats. In order to examine an attachability of the powder to a body surface, five 100 mesh powders, such as rice powder, starch, soybean powder, talc and silica gel were tested. Among them, rice powder attached to mice best, following starch, soybean powder and talc. The average powder weight attached was 0.5-0.7g per mouse in 15 second exposure. The tendency of effectiveness among the different powders containing 0.05% scilliroside which was contacted to the mouse coincided fairly with the order of attachability to the body mentioned above. In the test to examine the effect of rodenticides in the rice powder, the chemicals which gave the complete mortality in a time as short as 15-60 second were 0.05% scillirocide and 5% ANTU. The other chemicals also showed comparatively high mortality with the exception of 1% thallium sulphate. When powders containing single dose rodenticide were treated on a short runway which was made of tin plate, the mortality of rats was lower than that of mice exposed to the same powder. On the other hand, coumatetraryl, an anticoagulant rodenticide, showed 100% mortality in 3 to 7 days when 2g of 0.25% powder was treated on the runway in the area of 15×15cm.

N2  - Discriminant function was applied to the morphological differentiation of adult females of autogenous Culex pipiens molestus (Cpm) from anautogenous C. p. pallens (Cpp) in Nagoya City, central Japan. 1) Measurements (or counts) were made of various parts of female mosquitoes, and the ten quantitative characters listed below were tested for the discrimination efficiency : (1) Ommatidal number (2) HS value of the horse shoe (3) Rc/Mc ratio (4) WL/Rs ratio (5) P/D ratio (6) Rc/Rs ratio (7) WL/Rc ratio (8) r/m ratio (9) WL/WW ratio (10) Mc/Ms ratio (Fig. 1). 2) It was difficult to discriminate Cpm from Cpp by any one of these characters because distribution intervals between the rejection limits. (α=0.05) more or less overlapped each other (Fig. 2,Table 1). 3) In order to evaluate the discrimination efficiency of the ten characters, discrimination index (DI) was obtained as follows : DI=d/A_p+A_m where d signified the difference between mean values of the same characters in Cpm and Cpp, A_p and A_m denoted Av alues calculated as follows for Cpp and Cpm, respectively. [numerical formula] u^2 : unbiased estimate of variance N : number of samples inspected F^1_<N-1> (0.05) : F value at a 5% level of significance for degree of freedom n_1=1,n_2=N-1 When the index for a certain character is over unity, this character can be used for the discrimination between Cpm and Cpp; and the larger the index, the more effective the discrimination by the character. However, the discrimination indices calculated for the ten characters ranged from a maximum value of 0.8954 (ommatidial number) to a minimum of 0.0297 (Mc/Ms ratio), revealing that any one of these was not good enough by itself. 4) Various discriminant functions were obtained when different number of characters were used. The critical points of the discriminant values were so fixed that α should be equal to β, where αsignified the probability of committing type I error in which Cpp might be mistaken for Cpm and β signified that of type II error in which Cpm might be mistaken for Cpp. As a result, the probability α (=β) was calculated to be about 2% when three characters. were used; and it decreased to about 1% when six characters were employed (Fig. 3,Table 3). 5) In the case of Cpp, there existed significant linear correlations between each of the seven characters out of the ten and wing length, which varied considerably with the breeding month (Fig. 4,Table 4). 6) The extent of the seasonal variations in the ten characters of Cpp was found to range from about 1 to 12% of the annual mean values (Table 5). But no significant differences were seen among the monthly averages of the discriminant values derived from the six characters : ommatidal number, Rc/Mc ratio, WL/Rs ratio, P/D ratio, R_C/R_R ratio and HS value.

N2  - 1) Field control tests against the fly larvae applying organophosphorus emulsions and granules to the privies were carried out from July to September, 1970,in Saitama Prefecture. 2) Larvicidal treatments of NK-1202,at the rate of 2 liters of 0.0125% emulsion or 10g of 3% granule per square meter, gave satisfactory effect, but the larvae appeared again in 7 days after the application. Exterminatory effect of the insectidides was the following sequence : NK-1202-Diazinon-Fenthion. 3) The control effect with granules proved to be higher than that of emulsions.

N2  - Ovicidal activity of synthetic juvenile hormone analogues was evaluated for human body lice. Among five compounds tested, p-ethyl phenyl epoxy geranyl ether (Compound No. 5) was most effective in blocking embryonic development when the adults were continuously contacted to cotton pads impregnated with the compound, showing that the LD_<50> was about 27μg/(cm)^2. Contrary to the general conception that the JH has no effect on the survival of adult insects, many of lice continuously exposed to the SJHA could not survive for longer period than the controls. Mortality of the lice treated with 0.016 μg/(cm)^2 of Compound No. 5 exceeded by 50% at day 10. The results are of special interest to control the human body lice which has become resistant to all conventional insecticides.

N2  - This paper describes the characterization of the skin reactive substances from the horse-fly, Tabanus iyoensis. 1. Strongly skin reactive substances were extracted from the thorax and the abdomen of adult female bodies. Activities both from the thorax and the abdomen distributed similarly in the further fractionation process, i.e. the gel filtration by various types of Sephadex and the chromatography by ionexchange Sephadex. 2. The active substances seemed to be non-dialyzable proteins which, in respect to the molecular weight, were subdivided into 2 categories, one having the M. W. of more than 200,000 and the other the M. W. of 50,000 to 100,000. This, with the results of the ion-exchange chromatography, suggests that several substances rather than a single one, which are not very toxic themselves, are related to the human skin reaction. 3. The agar gel diffusion between the abdomen extracts and the corresponding rabbit antiserum (an active fraction after the G-25 gel filtration was used for immunization) revealed at least 2 lines, of which the main line located toward the antibody side seemed to be unrelated to the skin reaction. In the experiments with the absorbed antiserum, however, the other line disappeared when the skin reactivity (activity L) was present in the fraction used for the absorption, indicating that there may be a close connection between them. 4. Neither a hemolytic substance observed in the abdomen extracts nor a pink-colored substance in the thorax extracts having an absorption maximum at 410mμ was related to the skin reactivity.

N2  - The lethal doses and the feeding preference of scilliroside baits to Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, were studied in the laboratory. The lethal doses of scilliroside in dry baits were higher than those in wet baits. The approximate lethal doses of scilliroside in dry baits represented per kilogramme body weight of the rats were as follows : male 3.1mg and female 1.7mg for 0.017% bait; male 1.5mg and female 1.0mg for 0.03% bait; male 1.5mg and female 1.0mg for 0.05% bait. The lethal doses in wet baits were as follows : male 1.6mg and female 1.0mg for 0.017% bait; male 1.0mg and female 1.0mg for 0.03% and 0.05% baits. Some of the rats used in the present study tended to avoid feeding dry baits at lethal doses and more males survived than the females; i.e., about 70% of the males and 30% of the females survived with 0.017% dry bait, and about 30% of the males and 15% of the females did with 0.03% and 0.05% dry baits. Some of the rats survived also with the wet baits.

N2  - Feeding with various amount of food, "Oriental Rat Food MF powder", population equilibrium, age composition, and response of individuals to traps were investigated with experimental populations of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica L. at a constant temperature of 27±1℃ and 16 hours illumination per day (Fig. 1). When supplied with 4g, 8g or 16g of food every 30 days, or 3g every week, populations starting with 10 adult females with oothecae attained an equilibrium state within two months. The proportion of nymphs in populations in the equilibrium state was usually about 80% or more (Figs. 2,3 and 4). When an excess amount of food was given to the populations, the number of cockroaches increased almost two-fold in 10 days. The increase was largely due to that of 2nd to final-instar nymphs. Thus, the break of the equilibrium caused an increase of the nymphal proportion in the populations (Fig. 5). Catches of cockroaches in glass jar traps without bait showed a periodicity which was exactly parallel with that of the additions of new food. Peaks of the catches occurred just before the addition of new food, while the fewest catches just after it (Fig. 6). These results appear to indicate that, in controlling the German cockroach, the use of poisonous food baits may be more effective than to utilize sex pheromones which attract only adult insects.

N2  - There was an outbreak of about 30 cases of an acute febrile exanthematic disease among school children in Yamada, a mountain village in Toyama Prefecture, northern Honshu, during March-April, 1968. Laboratory tests for various exanthematic diseases were all negative, excepting for that positive results were obtained in Weil-Felix tests with OXK in 6 of 9 sera examined. Two out of 4 sera were a also positive in the fluorescent antibody tests against rickettsia of Tsutsugamushi disease. Seasonal surveys of trombiculid mites and tests of infection with the rickettsiae of the rodent hosts were carried out in the same area during one year's period from April 1969 at intervals of about one month. In the complement fixation tests of sera collected from 34 field mice (Apodemus speciosus) trapped during May and June, 17 (65%) were positive against Rickettsia orientalis. A total of 208 Apodemus speciosus and 15 Microtus montebelli were trapped and examined from the area during the one year survey, and altogether 7,504 chiggers (trombiculid mites) were recovered from these rodent hosts and from a wild bird Troglodytes troglodytes. The chiggers were classified into 5 genera and 10 species, as shown in Table 1. The most abundant among them was Leptotrombidium fuji, which showed peaks of the density both in autumn and spring. L. pallidum, a species known as one of the vectors of Tsutsugamushi disease in Japan, was the third in the order of abundance following Gahrliepia saduski, and also showed its peaks in the spring and autumn. Although further studies are necessary for drawing final conclusion, the above observations suggest that the disease could possibly be Tsutsugamushi disease transmitted to the patients by L. pallidum.

N2  - Trial application of discriminant function was proposed for the differentiation of three types of Culex pipiens complex, C.p. fatigans Wiedemann, 1828 (Cpf), C.p. pallens Coquillett, 1898 (Cpp) and C.p. molestus Forskal, 1778 (Cpm) in Japan. Using this method, a new approach was made to the problem whether Cpm or Cpf adults were mixed or not in "Cpp imaginal populations" captured in the open field of Nagoya City, central Japan. 1) The mean values of diagnostic characters in the specimens of Cpf (Naha strain). Cpp (Nagoya strain) and Cpm (Nagoya strain) used as a temporary standard for comparison were as follows respectively : D/V ratio of male genitalia (Fig. 2)=0.38,0.79 and 1.08; SB value (Fig. 2)=17.1,11.1 and 5.8 unit (1 unit=2.5μ); ommatidial number of female (Fig. 3)=80.0 (8.9/row), 78.6 (8.9/row) and 60.7 (7.8/row); HS value of female genitalia (Fig. 3)=22.5,21.3 and 25.6 unit (Table 1 and Figs. 2,3). 2) When x_1 denotes the D/V ratio, x_2 the SB value of male, and x_1' denotes the ommatidial number (square value of the average number per row), x_2' the HS value of female, the discriminant functions are determined as general equations, Z_m=λ_1x_1+λ_2x_2 and Z_f=λ_1x_1'+λ_2x_2' (Table 2). The discriminant values in all of the specimens were calculated by substituting corresponding values of the above characters for x_1 or x_1' and x_2 or x_2' in the respective equation. As a result, frequency distributions of these discriminant values were clearly separated from each other with only a few exceptions (Figs. 4,5). 3) The critical point of the discriminant values was fixed so that α might be equal to β for male mosquitoes, where α signified the probability of committing type I error in which Cpp might be mistaken for Cpm (or Cpf) and β signified that of type II error in which Cpm (or Cpf) might be mistaken for Cpp (Fig. 4). The rejection limit of the discriminant values of Cpp (one sided probability of type I error, α=0.01) was used as a critical point in differentiating Cpm from Cpp in the case of famale (Fig. 5). 4) Judging by the above critical discriminant values, the number of male mosquitoes morphologically identified as Cpm and Cpf was 0 and 2 (ca. 0.5%) respectively, and the number of female identified as Cpm was 2 (ca. 2%) in the Cpp imaginal populations captured in the open field (Figs. 6,7,8 and Table 3). 5) An advantage was discussed that an integrated and objective discrimination could be expected when the discriminant function derived from the quantitative diagnostic characters is properly applied to the identification of allied species. A discussion was given of supplementary use of the function as an aid to differentiate only indistinguishable individuals by one character.

N2  - In order to verify the stages of the life history in which 4 species of cockroaches, B. germanica, P. americana, P. fuliginosa, and P. japonica should encounter the winter under unheated conditions in Central Japan, effects of 3 temperature-photoperiod combinations upon the development and reproduction of the cockroaches were investigated. The results seem to indicate that, under unheated conditions in Central Japan, most of newly hatched nymphs of the Periplaneta species will not become adult in the same year, and all developmental stages may encounter the winter, though the retardation of development in the second and/or final instar of Periplaneta species seems to restrict the stage distribution of winter populations of the species mainly to these instars. The results also suggest that a "two-year life cycle" may be rather normal, especially in P. japonica, under outdoor conditions. In B. germanica, adults and nymphs of older instars seem to be the major stages which encounter the winter.

N2  - The top minnow, Gambusia affinis (Baird et Girard, 1853), is a viviporous poeciliid fish native of the southern United States, and has been introduced into a number of countries mainly with the purpose of malaria control. In Japan, the fish is known to be imported in 1916 via Hawaii and Taiwan, and has been found recently to be breeding widely in polluted waters in and around the city of Tokyo. The present paper deals with the results of observations on Gambusia introduced from Tokyo to Tokushima City of Shikoku Island in April 1969. Tokushima is a city situated on the delta of Yoshino River, where tremendous numbers of mosquitoes were breeding every year in swamps, ditches and rice paddies difficult to be drained. Surveys were carried out on the larval breeding places, and on the seasonal prevalence of adults with light traps set at 6 stations. Of 14 species of mosquitoes found in this area, Culex pipiens pallens was predominant and most widely distributed, while Anopheles sinensis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus were also found abundantly in some swamp areas. In some salt marshes near the sea coast, tremendous breeding of Aedes dorsalis was observed in the rainy seasons. Under such environmental conditions, it was considered by us that the introduction of Gambusia might be an effective measure for the control of mosquitoes, and two shipments of about 400 fishes collected from sewage ditches in the Tokyo International Airport were made to Tokushima by air cargo in April and May, 1969. The fishes were released and bred first in certain ponds and pools, and were further distributed to other ponds, swamps and ditches from the autumn of 1969. Especially successful and effective was the culture of Gambusia in the salt water marshes where Aedes dorsalis had been breeding; from August 1970,one year after the first batch of some 500 fishes were released, they became visible in high population densities all over the swamps, and thereafter complete eradication of the mosquito larvae could be achieved from these areas. Field and laboratory studies were made with Gambusia thus successfully established in large number of pools in and around this city. The results are described in this report on its distribution, the trend of increase in the population densities, the competition with the indigenous fishes such as Oryzias latipes, the capacity as a predator of mosquito larvae, the correlation of the number of youngs borne with the body size of the mother fishes, the intervals of the births, the resistance to the cold temperature and to various poisonous substances in water, etc.

N2  - The morphological features of male accessory gland which were devided into three zones to take for convenience as in Fig. 1,were observed by electron microscope. The gland is surrounded by a thin muscle layer which has the basement membrane on both outer and inner surfaces. The spermatozoa and secretion granules can be seen in the luminal space from anterior zone to posterior zone. Secretion granules are also seen in the epithelial cells and classified in three types; A, B and C. A type granules, which vary in size and shape, are bounded by a membrane and consist of electron dense part and vacuole part. B type granules, which are surrounded by a membrane, have electron dense round, rarely amorphous region in the center of these granules and less dense part around the dense region. C type granules vary in size, shape and electron density. The epitherial cells which consist of a single layer are devided into four types according to the types of including granules. The first type cell has A type granules and well developed granular endoplasmic reticula. This type of cell is located in all zones. The second type cell with B type granules and granular endoplasmic reticula is seen only in the posterior zone. The third type cell with C type granules and granular endoplasmic reticula is situated only in the posterior zone. The fourth type cell without granules is seen on a side of the gland wall from anterior zone to posterior zone in groups.

N2  - Following to the former report (Harada et al., 1971), the survival and longevity of adult mosquitoes, Culex pipiens molestus and Aedes togoi, when fed on the flowers of 13 herbaceous and 5 woody plants were observed under laboratory conditions of room temperature during the period from April to September, 1971. Among the flowers of herbaceous plants tested, common vetch (Vicia sativa, Leguminosae) was most effective on the longevity of Culex, which had mean life-spans of 24 days in males and 28 days in females. The flowers of milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus, Leguminosae) which was tested with Aedes togoi was secondarily effective and the mean life-spans of them were 22 days in males and 17 days in females respectively. Rape (Brassica napus, Cruciferae), speedwell (Veronica persica, Scrophulariaceae) and sorrel vine (Cayratia japonica, Vitaceae) were all similarly effective on the survival and longevity of Culex or Aedes mosquitoes fed on these flowers and the maximum life-spans of them reached into a month or 40 days. The mosquitoes fed on the other flowers, such as dandelion (Taraxacum platycarpum, Compositae), cottonweed (Gnaphalium multiceps, Compositae) and fleabane (Erigeron philadelphicus, Compositae), reached into a month or more in their maximum life-spans but the greater parts of them died in about 10 days after the feedings. The survivorship curves of both male and female Aedes (and Culex) mosquitoes fed on the flowers of white clover (Trifolium repens, Leguminosae), stitchwort (Stellaria aquatica, Caryophyllaceae), houttuynia (H. cordata, Saururaceae), a kind of fleabane (Erigeron annuus, Compositae) and shepherd's purse (Capsella Bursa-pastoris, Cruciferae) were almost similar to that of the insects fed on plain water only and almost all died in 8-12 days after the feedings. Among the flowers of 5 woody plants, chestnut tree (Castanea crenata, Fagaceae) was most effective on the longevity of both male and female Aedes mosquitoes, about 80% individuals survived even after 25 days, and the next was Japanese privet (Ligustrum japonicum, Oleaceae), about 60% in males and 70% in females survived after 24 days respectively, and also the insects fed on the flowers of Japanese spindle tree (Euonymus japonica, Celastraceae) survived about 20% individuals after 30 days. In these cases, however, the maximum life-spans could not be seen owing to the shortage of the flowers which must be offered to the insects. Other woody plants, such as Japanese snowflower (Deutzia crenata, Saxifragaceae) and box tree (Buxus microphylla, Buxaceae) were fairly effective on the survival and longevity of Aedes mosquitoes. So it seems to be obvious that the flowers of woody plants including shrubs and arbors are more useful to maintain the insect life than that of the herbaceous plants in general. As a result of the surveys on the sexual differences of the longevities of both Culex and Aedes mosquitoes fed on 5 flowers it was found that male Aedes was longer than male Culex in the mean life-span as well as in the maximum lifespan. This suggests that the male Aedes mosquitoes suck nectar more actively than the male Culex. On the other hand, Aedes mosquitoes had 2 gonotrophic cycles even without any sugar solution but they could repeat 4 cycles under the feeding on 1% or 5% cane sugar solution. This finding suggests that, in natural conditions, adult mosquitoes must take nectar or some sugar containing fluids in order to repeat several gonotrophic cycles.

N2  - Observations were made on bionomics of the horsefly Tabanus iyoensis SHIRAKI, during the summers of 1969 and 1970 at Nakanokochi, Toyama. Three dry-ice traps were used for the collection, and approximately 250,000 horseflies were collected and examined. They belonged to 10 species, of which 98% were T. iyoensis. The biting activity of the females of this species were seen during the season from the end of July to the middle of August. The activity peak in 1970 occurred about one week earlier than in 1969,probably due to warmer climate in June. The population density and the life span of the horseflies were estimated by utilizing the LINCOLN Index and JOLLY's stochastic methods from the recapture rate of artificially marked specimens. The survival rate of the horsefly for one day was estimated to be approximately 64%, and no seasonal variation was observed. Hence, the accumulative population of females in one season of this area was estimated to be about 2.2×(10)^6. The habitat of the female horseflies was mostly restricted to areas along the streams, and the population density in such area was estimated to be 1.7 per square metre at the peak in the middle of August, with the accumulative density of 7 per square metre per year. However, the breeding places of the larvae were apparently distributed to much wider areas, and there were relatively few larvae actually discovered in areas along the streams.

N2  - An ecological study was made on the larval and imaginal populations of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett, in Nagoya City during a period April to November, 1969. The purpose of this report is to elucidate relationship between larval and imaginal population dynamics in natural habitat from the view points of seasonal change of larval population size, larval age structure, imaginal population size and parous rate of adult females. 1) The number of larvae and pupae in a fertilizer pit was estimated by the removal method (Fig. 2), and totalled 11,962 during the study period. Most of them (ca. 98%) were Culex pipiens pallens and the rest were C. tritaeniorhynchus, C. vorax, Anopheles sinensis and Aedes togoi (Table 1). In the vicinity of the fertilizer pit, a total of 123 adult mosquitoes were captured by a light trap during the same period. They consisted of 61% C. tritaeniorhynchus, 38% C. pipiens pallens and about 1% An. sinensis (Table 2). 2) The larval population of C. pipiens pallens occurred from late April to early November, and the population size reached its peaks during late May to early June and in early October (Table 1). Larval age structure was analyzed consecutively and, on the basis of the precursory abundance of the older larvae and pupae, adult emergence at population level was considered to occur about six times. Of these, number of newly emerged adults was estimated to be the largest at the second emergence period (late May-early June) and the next largest at the fifth emergence (late September-early October)(Fig. 3). 3) On the other hand, imaginal population of the species observed by a light trap occurred from early April to early November, and the population size reached its peak in July, after the first peak of productivity of adults observed in the larval population. The second peak of productivity in autumn, however, was not followed by the prominent peak in adult population size (Fig. 3). Parous rate of adult females rose remarkably in early May and during late September to early October, and number of egg rafts in the fertilizer pit increased in parallel with the rises of the parous rate (Fig. 3). 4) Life cycle of the house mosquito in spring in this district was summarized as follows : (a) Completion of overwintering of the adults around March to mid April, (b) appearance of the first larval population in late April, (c) appearance of imaginal population in early May.

N2  - 1. In the late spring of 1968,nuisance and biting problems by an unusually great number of adult mosquitoes took place in a suburban area of Kagamigahara City, Gifu Prefecture, Central Japan. Through a request of the city authorities, a series of field investigations were made on the population dynamics of the pest mosquitoes. Chemical and environmental control measures were also planned. 2. A pool which was receiving most of the raw wastes of a starch and woolen factories was found to be the main breeding source of the bothering mosquitoes. This pool was located at the river beach neighboring the residential quarter and had an extent of approximately 80 ares and an average depth of 0.2 meters. Population density of mosquito larvae and pupae at the station P selected in the pool was estimated by the removal method, and age structure of these aquatic stages was also analyzed. Imaginal population size in the residential district about 200 meters apart from the breeding source was estimated with light trap collections. These investigations were continued on the weekly basis during the period from June to November, 1968. 3. As the results, it was known that the overall species composition of mosquitoes of this area was very unusual for such a typical suburban habitat surrounded by many paddy fields; more than 90 percent of the collected adults and larvae were the house mosquitoes, Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett. This uncommonness was further ascertained by the comparison with the results of our mosquito surveys simultaneously performed in other two areas with similar topographical features. For the correct identification of the species, examinations were made of ommatidial number in females as well as DV/D value in males randomly sampled from the above "C. pipiens pallens" population. The results revealed that the autogenous house mosquito, C. pipiens molestus, was not intermixed. 4. Population dynamics of the C. pipiens pallens was studied by analyzing the seasonal change of larval population size and age structure. It was presumed that the adults had four definite peaks of emergence in late June, mid and late July, and early August on the bases of precursory ageing in the larval population. The actual number of adults collected by light traps and the above presumption were proven to be in good agreement. 5. Details of the control measures taken to cope with the outbreak were described, and several problems in the planning of insecticide application along with the merit and demerit of the environmental control of the pest mosquitoes, particularly of the construction of drainages, were discussed in relation to the pollution of inland water.

N2  - Some fundamental experiments on the insecticidal activities of Cynock, O, O-dimethyl-O-(4-cyanophenyl) phosphorothioate, to sanitary insect were carried out in the laboratory comparing with other commonly used insecticides. The median lethal doses of Cynock against houseflies, german cockroaches and smoky brown cockroaches were 0.115μg, 0.26μg and 1.35μg per insect respectively and the median lethal concentration to mosquito larvae was 0.017ppm. The potency of Cynock to control houseflies seemed to be equal to that of fenitrothion. For controlling against mosquito larvae Cynock showed a good persistency of the efficacy in filthy water containing decomposed laboratory-animal food as same as in distilled water, comparing with the rapid detoxification of fenitrothion in the filthy water. Cynock was the most effective to cockroaches among the insecticides tested in the present study by the topical application, the film contact and the bait method. From the results of these experiments, it is presume that Cynock is a very promising sanitary insecticide in practical use because of its high insecticidal activity, long persistency of efficacy to the insect and low toxicity to mammals.

N2  - Production and laboratory use of newly hatched nymphs of Periplaneta americana for detecting insecticidal activity of chemicals with a dry film method have already been reported by Tsuji and Mizuno (1970). In this paper, effects of population density of parents, maternal age, and environmental humidity during the egg stage upon the body weight of the nymphs and their sensitivity to fenitrothion are described. The mean weight of adults was somewhat decreased when they were reared in a overcrowded condition which made some of them be forced out of the shelter (harborage) in their adult stage, and middle-aged adults were heavier than young ones. The greatest difference among the mean weights, however, did not exceed 31.5% of the greatest mean, which was found in a less crowded population. The mean weight per hatched nymphs in each ootheca was also influenced by the density and age of parents, but the influence was smaller than on parents themselves. Thus, the greatest difference among the mean weights did not exceed 20.4% of the greatest mean. The mean weight per hatched nymphs in each ootheca was not so much influenced by the weight of the ootheca; smaller oothecae tended to produce fewer nymphs. When oothecae were incubated in the fully water saturated air, LD_<50> values (mg/kg and μg/10 nymphs) of fenitrothion applied to hatching nymphs by the dry film method were fairly stable for practical purposes irrespective of the age and density of parents, but the LD_<50> values were considerably decreased when oothecae were incubated under a lower grade of humidity.

N2  - In order to revise the specific name of Haematobia found in Japan, we examined and compared whole the available material with the specimens of Haematobia exigua captured in Nepal and Taiwan, and Haematobia irritans taken in Europe and Hawaii. From the opinions of the previous authors quoted in this paper, as well as from our own findings, it seems reasonable to concluded herein that irritans and exigua are distinguishable and the Haematobia of Japan is irritans. Reliable characters to distinguish exigua from irritans may be as follows : 1) In the male of exigua the second segment of the hind tarsi bears 4 to 6 very long hairs with curled tips on the posterior margin, whereas in irritans it has only one long hair on the distal end. 2) The basal bristle on the ventral surface of the hind femur is always brown, long and strong in irritans, whereas it is pale, short and weak in exigua. 3) The acrostichal hairs tend to be more regularly arranged in fewer rows (4 rows) in exigua than in irritans (5-6 rows). 4) The color of the female palpi is generally brownish in irritans, but yellowish in exigua. 5) The lower squamae are white with light brown margins in exigua, but those are light brown with dark brown margins in irritans. 6) The color of the thoracic hairs and frontal bristles are usually yellow to light brown in exigua, but brown to blackish brown in irritans. 7) It is difficult to settle one specimen to irritans or exigua based on the number of frontal bristles, but this character can be applied to separate a population to irritans or exigua. 8) Likewise the measurement of body length appears to be useful to sort out a population to irritans or exigua.

N2  - Domestic pigeons produced viremia almost readily for first 5 days when they were inoculated with Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus. JE virus persisted in liver and kidney of one pigeon out of 6 used at least for 39 days. Immune response of infected pigeons was not high, and the antibody levels decreased gradually through a 15-week observation. No cyclic fluctuation of antibody levels was observed during the observation period. The mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus was infected by feeding on a viremic pigeon when the virus concentration of blood exceeded (10)^<1.3> suckling mice (ICLD)_<50>/0.02ml. The tick Argas japonicus, on the contrary, failed to accept the virus through the feeding on the viremic pigeon. These findings had different pictures from those of West Nile virus infected in pigeons and Argas ticks.

N2  - Field tests of rat control were carried out in residental areas to know a pattern in consumption of baits with warfarin and thallium sulfate and also to know the estimating method of the rat population exposed to the baits by daily consumption of them. The dominant species inhabiting in these areas were Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus. It was observed that about one third of the exposed population of the rats in the experimental area fed warfarin baits on the first day, about two third on the second day and the maximum consumption was shown on the third day. Thereafter, feeding rate decreased. It was thought that three day intake of 0.03% warfarin bait was enough to kill almost all of the rats. If the population is very large of infiltration in rat from outside into the experimental area might be expected, the pattern of the bait consumption should be complicated. When rats were exposed to thallium sulfate baits, 33-44% of the total population would take the baits every day. In this case, one intake of the baits is fatal to rats. In both cases, rat population exposed to the baits could be estimated by the same method as the removal method by traps.

N2  - A series of studies have been carried out by us on the horse fly, Tabanus iyoensis Shiraki, which is a serious pest in certain areas in Toyama Prefecture. The present study mainly deals with the results of field and laboratory observations in its life history, with emphasis on the possibility of its autogenous reproduction. The results of dissection of females caught with both dry-ice traps and with insect nets have revealed that their parous rates are surprisingly high (93%, 543/584) even in the early season of their appearance (late July to early August). It is presumed from these observations that the horse fly mostly deposites autogenous eggs before taking the first blood meal. It has been also confirmed that the female horse flies reared from pupae in the laboratory mostly deposit eggs before taking a blood meal, even when the blood source is available. However, the blood meal seemed to be necessary for producing the second and the subsequent batches of eggs. The appearance of surprisingly large numbers of this horse fly seems to be due mainly to the involvement of such autogenous reproduction, especially in areas where almost no blood sources are available. Such an unusual mode of reproduction as the horse fly seems to be sufficient for maintaining their population density in large areas, and makes its control to be difficult.

N2  - The seasonal fluctuation of the density of larvae and pupae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus in paddy fields was investigated at Sijyonawate-cho, 1968-9. The number of larvae and pupae varied seasonally at each paddy field. In some paddy fields, the number of larvae and pupae tended to be maintained at relatively high level. On the contrary, in some paddy fields, for example, in paddy field L, the number of larvae and pupae was always smaller than the average. The number of 1st and 2nd instar larvae tended to be larger in the paddy fields in which the density of larvae was always high than in the ones in which the density was low (Fig.1). Water samples were taken from the paddy fields to check the survival rate of the 1st instar larvae in the laboratory at 30℃, 16 hr. illumination. The survival rate was higher in the water from the paddy fields where larvae were abundant (Fig.1, 2, Table 1). Higher survival rate was observed in the water taken from the paddy field at certain season when the number of larvae was high (Fig.3). However, when 0.1g of artificial food per pot was added to the water from paddy fields in which the density of larvae was low, the survival rate increased (Fig.2, Table 2). This suggests that the low value in the survival rate in water from some paddy fields may be attributed to the deficiency of food.

N2  - The epidemiological and entomological studies in the past have revealed that Japanese encephalitis in Japan usually spreads among pigs in early summer season and is transmitted to man mainly by the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The number of clinical encephalitis cases that occur in certain area is therefore considered to be determined roughly by the following formula : X=A×B×C×D×E×H^f×1/(-log_e H)×1/G×I×J×K, where X : the number of clinical cases in certain area in one season; A : the total number of pigs in this area; B : the percentage of pigs that produces viraemia in one season; C : the average length in days of the viraemia sufficient to infect the mosquitoes; D : the average number of the mosquitoes that feed on the pigs per day per pig during the viraemia season; E : the percentage of mosquitoes susceptible for the development of the virus; F : the average length of days required by the mosquitoes to become infective; G : the gonotrophic cycle in days of the mosquitoes; H : daily survival rate of the mosquitoes; I : the percentage of mosquitoes that feed on man in one bite; J : the percentage of people in the area who are susceptible (non-immune) to the virus; K : the percentage of people among the susceptible population who develop clinical symptoms after infected with the virus. The above formula can be applied when the mosquito density per man is relatively low and the people is not bitten by more than one infected mosquitoes. When the infective rate (S) and the average number of mosquitoes that bite man during the infective season (U) is known, the probability of a man receiving one or more infective bites (V) is obtained by the formula : V=1-(1-S)^U The infective rate (S) and the average number of mosquito bites per man (U) can be estimated directly, or by mathematical assumption from observed data. Therefore, the number of cases (X) can be estimated by the following formula, if the mosquitoes attack the people almost evenly : X=P×J×K×V, where P is the size of population of this area. The frequency distribution of the numbers of mosquito bites per man is, however, probably not "normal", but is considered to be more or less skew. If it is highly skew, such as seen in the distribution of microfilarial density among people in an endemic area, the problem becomes more complicated. As a general formula, the number of person to be infected in one season is determined by : Σ^^∞__<U=1> N_U[1-(1-S)^U], where N_U is the number of persons bitten by U (Number) mosquitoes per season. The answer to this formula can be obtained by observation of the pattern of frequency distribution of N_U.

N2  - An ecological study was made on overwintering mosquitoes in Aichi Prefecture, central part of Japan, during the period November, 1968 to May, 1969. The primary purpose of this report is to analyze some aspects of population dynamics of overwintering house mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, thereby to contribute in elucidating the analogous problems with C. tritaeniorhynchus, the main vector of Japanes encephalitis in Japan. The results are as follows : 1) The number of females captured during the present investigation was 900, of which about 67% were C. pipiens pallens, 13% were C. hayashii, and the rest were Anopheles sinensis, C. orientalis and C. vorax in decreasing order (Table 1). 2) Mosquito associations in nine caves were classified according to dominant species. As a result, they fell into three groups : (a) Association in which C. pipiens pallens was the dominant species, (b) association in which C. hayashii and C. pipiens pallens were dominant, and (c) association in which C. hayashii and C. orientalis were dominant (Table 2 and Fig.2). 3) The number of overwintering C. pipiens pallens resting on the inside wall of the cave was at its maximum in January, then decreased markedly late in February and became to nil in April (Table 4 and Fig.3). 4) Wing length distributions of the overwintering C. pipiens pallens females did not prove to be the normal patterns, whereas those of wild-caught summer populations showed the normal ones (Figs.4, 5). Using probability paper analysis for polymodal frequency distributions (Harding, 1949), the overwintering female populations were found to include two different component groups with regard to wing length; one was a long-winged group which accounted for about 90% of all the population, and the other was a short-winged group making up 10% (Figs.6, 7 and Table 5). 5) Each of the long-and short-winged groups was assumed to be a population exclusively composed of C. pipiens pallens, on the bases of combination of ommatidial number (Table 6) and absence during nursing period of the autogenous sign characteristic of C. pipiens molestus. 6) Wing length fluctuations of the two series of C. pipiens pallens females were traced consecutively; one was sampled with light traps and the other derived from wild-caught pupae (Fig. 8). They were sampled in the same or nearby areas where the above-described survey had been made. As a result, it became evident that females with as long wings as the overwintering long-winged group continued to appear from October on; and the overwintering short-winged group seemed to be derived from survivors in the summer populations. 7) Survival rate of the overwintered females was estimated by a continuous nursing experiment and by statistical analyses of wing length distributions of wild-caught populations, with the result that at least some of the females were considered to have survived until July of the following year (Table 7).

N2  - In the former report of experimental studies on the control of Tyrophagus putrescentiae in straw mats with various pesticides, it has been found that the installation of paper sheets impregnated with fenthion or fenitrothion, covering the entire upper and lower surfaces of tatami (straw mats), has seemed to be most effective and economical. The experiments reported here were carried out to determine suitable concentration of the pesticides to be impregnated to the paper sheets and their chronic toxicities. It is considered in these experiment that the sheets impregnated with 0.25%, 1.0% and 5.0% fenthion at rate of 100ml per square meter effective at least for 3 to 6 months, 6 to 8 months and more than a year, respetively. The paper sheets imprenated with fenitrothion seem to be effective for 2 months at concentration of 0.25%, for 4 months at 1% and 7 months at 5%. Results in the toxicological tests indicated that mice exposed continuously for 93 days to the sheets treated with 5% fenitrothion and 0.25% fenthion were not showed any adverse effects as compared with untreated ones. Although the sheets impregnated with 25% fenitrothion and 5% and 1% fenthion gave some toxicities to the mice exposed, these sheets were less toxic to the mice than two kinds of paper sheets which have been used practically for three to four years without any adverse effects to the occupants in the dwellings in Japan.

N2  - A test was carried out to control the acaroid mites found in tatami (straw mats) in the dwellings during May to July in 1970, by using paper sheets impregnated with fenthion and fenitrothion, covering the entire upper and lower surface of the tatami. Results of the present test showed that the paper sheets with 0.37% dieldrin, 0.5% fenthion and 1.0% fenitrothion (100ml/m^2) produced reductions of 95% to 100%, 99% to 100%, and 100%, respectively, compared with the number of mites counted in the untreated tatami at the end of the test, two months after the installation of the sheets.

N2  - Epidemiological surveys of Japanese encephalitis with special reference to seasonal prevalence of mosquitoes and virus isolation from Culex tritaeniorhynchus were carried out in Tsu areas, Mie Prefecture, in 1968 and 1969. For the survey of mosquito populations, light traps (black light 6 W) were operated through the night twice a week at the height of 1.5m inside a piggery of Tonomura (Fig.1). Japanese encephalitis virus isolations were weekly attempted from unfed C. tritaeniorhynchus caught in piggeries of Tonomura and Takajyaya (Fig.1). The results are summarized as follows : (1) C. tritaeniorhynchus was collected most dominantly, Anopheles sinensis came next, Aedes vexans was caught a little, and Culex pipiens pallens and Culex bitaeniorhynchus were found slightly from June to August as shown in Fig.2. A great number of C. tritaenioryhnchus was caught from early June to mid-July. This early increase in number of C. tritaeniorhynchus, compared with the seasonal prevalences of mosquitoes in other places of Japan, may be due to the fact that the breeding places of this species, mainly rice fields, are prepared in May in this area. (2) Despite of the great number of C. tritaeniorhynchus biting pigs in early June in this area, Japanese encephalitis was not detected from the mosquitoes until mid-July in 1968 and early July in 1969 as shown in Tables 1-4. These delayed detections of the virus may suggest the fact that the virus was not lead into amplifying cycles among pigs and mosquitoes by mid-June.

N2  - Mice were observed in a large bottle with the atomosphere of various concentrations of chlorpicrin or hydrogen phosphide, and the lethal time for them were measured respectively. Correlation between concentrations of chlorpicrin and the lethal time for mice was according to the equation, C t=K (Haber's law), and with hydrogen phosphide, the equation, (log C) t=K, would be applied, here C : concentrations of fumigants, t : the lethal time for mice, K : constant.

N2  - Susceptibility of field-collected Tabanus iyoensis adults to 15 insecticides (4 chlorinated hydrocarbons, 8 organophosphorus compounds and 3 pyrethroids) was examined by using the following test methods, i. e. topical application, film contact, spraying and dusting. The LD-50 values per female fly determined 6 hours after the topical application were 0.0213, 0.0587, 0.0893, 0.1485, 1.241 and 16.01μg for dichlorvos, fenitrothion, lindane, diazinon, ronnel and allethrin respectively. The KT-50 values obtained by the film contact test were 4.5, 5.0, 6.7, 11.0 and 13.2 minutes for pyrethrins, tetramethrin, dichlorvos, allethrin and naled respectively. Dichlorvos is regarded as the suitable insecticide to control the adults of this insect.

N2  - Field studies were conducted to examine the preference of rats for twelve commercial dry baits with anticoagulants in some residential areas near Fukuoka, where the Norway rat was supposed to be the dominant species. The preference was evaluated from total amounts of baits consumed throughout the test periods (for 5 to 9 days). In most cases animals tended to prefer white cylinder-type bait containing 0.1% of toxic ingredient to others which were given a choice to them simultaneously. It was difficult, however, to rank all baits in order of preference, since considerable difference in bait consumption was observed among test areas. The author is of the opinion that food preference tests should be done in at least three test areas, where rat population in each area is so high as more than 10g of bait being consumed in, at least, ten bait stations per one area and more than 200g of total baits consumed in one area.

N2  - Although Periplaneta japonica (Blattaria : Blattidae) is a common domiciliary cockroach in Japan, very few observations have been reported on the hibernation of this species. The authors found a lot of hibernating individuals of this species outdoors in a snowy area, Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture. The cockroaches hid themselves in splits of decayed woods which had been piled up on the ground under a big tree in a farmer's garden and covered with heavy snow. All the cockroaches found were nymphs, 6mm to 23mm (final instar) in body length. The habitat is covered with snow for about 70 days every winter. According to the records of Kashiwazaki Meteorological Observatory, the daily lowest air temperature in this area is always below 0℃ for more than 2 months in winter. The final instar nymphs collected on 13th January and reared at 20℃ began to emerge into adults on 4th March.

N2  - The segregation of the siphonal hair types was observed in the progenies which were produced by the parent populations composed of type 5-5 of the siphonal hair type in Culex pipiens molestus (Tables 3 and 4). When the selection progressed; the frequency of type 4-4 decreased; that of 5-4 fluctuated between 11.3 and 44.5%; that of type 5-5 increased; and the types other than the above did not occur. Viability of the type 5-5 population decreased so as not to yield the 11th generation.

N2  - The survival and longevity of both male and female Culex mosquitoes, C. pipiens and C. tritaeniorhynchus, when offered flowers of some nectar plants were observed in the laboratory under the conditions of room temperature during the period from April to September, 1970. Four nectar plants, such as rape (Brassica napus L., Cruciferae), milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L., Leguminosae), white clover (Trifolium repens L., Leguminosae) and sorrel vine (Cayratia japonica Gagn., Vitaceae) were used respectively as nectar sources for the insects. The flowers of them were gathered every day from the field and put in the mosquito cage of 30cm cube in which a lot of the mosquitoes have just started the adult stage and, on the other hand, water and 0.5% cane sugar solution were given severally to another cage as a control for the nectar feedings. The flower, water and sugar solution were renewed every morning and all dead mosquitoes which lay down every cage were removed and counted. At the same time with the above experiments, the survival and longevity of blood-fed mosquitoes were observed to make clear effects of blood meal on the length of life of the insects. Briefly summarizing, it was found from the data presented that, when the mosquitoes were given flowers tested except white clover, longevity prolonged exceedingly as compared with the control specimens received plain water only, although female adults which had been fed on sugar were able to survive for the longest periods, 5-20 days (2-4 days in male) longer in the mean life duration than adults which had been offered nectars. The maximum life spans of the female adults were 25 days in rape and more than one month in both milk vetch and sorrel vine feedings respectively and, in the life span, the latter two were almost equal to that of the adults which had been fed on sugar. Male adults showed a less life span than females, about two weeks in general in the cases of nectar feeding. The survivorship curves of both male and female mosquitoes which had been offered white clover were almost similar to that of the insects received plain water only and almost all died within a week or so owing probably to too short proboscis to sup nectar of the flower. In the blood feeding tests it was found that, when the mosquitoes were fed on mice, most of them, 70-80% or more, could survive until 3-4 days after taking the blood but rapidly died within a week after that and, even in a case of the double blood feedings, survivorship curve was almost unchanged although 3-4 days longer in the life span than the former which was offered single blood meal. It seems to be obvious accordingly that blood meal is not sufficient to maintain life beyond several days for the most adult mosquitoes and they have to take nectar or some sugarcontaining fluids other than blood to maintain existence for long periods.

N2  - The two mosquito species, widely distributed in Japan, Culex triteaniorhynchus summorosus Dyar and Culex pseudovishnui Colless, are closely related and difficult to be differenciated in adults (especially in females), and therefore most of the ecological studies carried out in the past in relation to the transmission of Japanese encephalitis made observations with the mixed populations of the two species. Since the author and his colleagues recently elucidated that they could be clearly differenciated by the presence or absence of erect white scales on the vertex of adults, detailed observations on differences in ecology of the two species were carried out in a hilly area of Okayama Prefecture, western Honshu, where relative population density of the latter was high. The seasonal changes in the population density of adults of the above two species were investigated by weekly collections with black-light traps, dry ice traps using mosquito net, and by those with sucking tubes in animal houses. Quantitative collections of immature stages from the breeding places were carried out also at stations selected from rice paddies located on a hill slope. The difference between the two species were most clearly seen in the seasonal changes in the larval population; C.t.s. began to increase earlier from late June and reached to a peak in the end of July, while C. pv. was found to increase from mid July with the peak in mid August. Such differences in adult populations were rather obscure, but the ratio of C. pv. to C.t.s. was found to be lower in July than in June and August. The distribution of larvae in 31 quaters of rice paddies under observation has also revealed the difference in the behavior of the two species; The larvae of C.t.s. were found mainly in the lower parts of the paddies where the temperature of water was higher, while that of C. pv. were restricted more to the upper cooler waters, though both showed expansion of the territories to opposite sides at the peak seasons of population densities. The biting rhythm of female mosquitoes as observed by all-night collections from the body of cattle or pigs was found to be essentially the same between the two species, being active all through the night time with inconspicuous peaks of the activity at around 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. and was shown to be essentially different from that of the Culex pipiens complex of mosquitoes which was demonstrated previously to be active with a peak at midnight. The total numbers of adults collected during this season were higher in ratios of P. pv. to C.t.s. with the animal baited traps than with the dry ice or blacklight traps. As for the attractiveness among the animals, the ratio of C. pv. to C.t.s. was higher on cattle than on pigs. In observations made with mosquito net traps baited with man and pig, both species were attracted more to the pig than to man, but the ratios among the total mosquito species collected were about twice higher on pigs in C.t.s. than in C. pv.

N2  - An ecological study was made on the larval and imaginal populations of medically important mosquitoes in Nagoya district during a period from April to November, 1968. The purposes of this report are to estimate relative abundance of newly emerged adults at population level from the view points of seasonal change of larval population size and larval age structure in paddy fields, and to know relation between the above population dynamics of larvae and seasonal prevalence of adult mosquitoes in the vicinity of the paddy fields. 1) The number of larvae and pupae in the paddy fields was estimated by the removal method, and totaled 2, 423 during the study period. Dominant species, Culex pipiens pallens, accounted for more than 50%, C. tritaeniorhynchus for about 26% and the rest were C. orientalis, Anopheles sinensis and C. vishnui in decreasing order (Table 1). In the vicinity of the paddy fields, 1, 101 adult mosquitoes were captured by a light trap. They consisted of about 64% C. pipiens pallens, 23% C. tritaeniorhynchus and 13% An. sinensis, Aedes vexans nipponii, C. orientalis and C. hayashii (Table 2). 2) The larval population of C. tritaeniorhynchus occurred from mid June to late October, and the population size reached its peak early in July. From the consecutive analyses of larval age structure, adult emergence at population level was recognized four times (Fig.3), and newly emerged adults were estimated to be most abundant at the second emergence time (around the early part of July) on the basis of the precursory abundance of the fourth instar larvae and pupae. On the other hand, imaginal population of the species occurred from late June to late September. And the population size reached its maximum in late July, about two weeks after the preexisted maximum adult production in the larval population (Fig. 3). 3) The larval population of An. sinensis occurred from mid June to early October, and the population size was at its peak early in July. From the consecutive age structure analyses, adult emergence at population level was recognized three to four times (Fig. 3), and newly emerged adults seemed to be most abundant at the second emergence time (about the early part of July). Imaginal population of the species was occurred from early June to early September, and the population size reached its highest peak in late July, about two weeks after the maximum adult production in the larval population (Fig. 3). 4) The larval population of C. pipiens pallens occurred during mid June and mid July, and the highest population peak was observed in early July. Adult emergence at population level was recognized only for a short period as the result of the age structure analyses, and newly emerged adults seemed to be most abundant in late July (Fig. 3). In spite of the relatively short prevalence period of larval population in paddy fields, imaginal population of this species occurred during a long period from late April through mid October. This phenomenon seems due to the fact that the larval populations of this species usually prevail throughout the spring-autumn seasons in many a fertilizer pit in and around the area under the present investigation. The imaginal population size, however, was observed to reach its peaks shortly after the maximum adult production in the larval population was seen in the paddy fields (Fig. 3).

N2  - Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles was collected by light traps through the night in cowsheds and pigpens. There was a linear relation between the number of mosquitoes trapped in the outside of a cowshed and the number of mosquitoes in the cowshed (Fig.1). The blood feeding rates decreased depending on the number of mosquitoes per one cow or swine. (Fig.2, 3 and 4). Percent ratios of females with a trace amount of blood meal among entire blood-fed populations increased in accordance with the increase of population densities (Table 1). This suggests that the interference among individual mosquito has an important role when mosquitoes exist abundantly. In every collections, the blood feeding rates of both nulliparous and parous females decreased depending on the number of mosquitoes. But when the number of mosquitoes was over 5, 000, the blood feeding rates of parous females. (Fig.5). When the number of mosquitoes was over 15, 000, the estimated number of parous females began to decrease in a cowshed (Fig.7), but in a paddy fiield, the estimated number of parous females collected by a dryice light trap did not decrease even when the number of mosquitoes was 78, 152 (Table 2). An estimation was thus made that unlliparous females may disperse if the number of mosquitoes was over 5, 000, and parous females may also disperse when the number of mosquitoes increased over 15, 000.

N2  - Observation of nocturnal flight activity of Culex tritaeniorhynchus was carried out by means of hourly collection in a light trap and the dissection of the females. The diurnal changes of C. tritaeniorhynchus showed a bimodal pattern and the height of two peaks fluctuated regularly according to population trend. When numbers caught through the night increased, numbers in the first peak increased remarkable but those in the second peak slightly. The proportion of numbers in the first peak for numbers caught through the night increased to almost 90%. The parous rate at 19-20hrs. was lower than that at 03-04hrs, and in parous females caught at 03-04hrs. there were many individuals that the condition of the connecting stalk of follicle showed sac like. These observations suggest that the age-composition fluctuates through the night in nocturnal flight activity of female population.

N2  - A comparison was made on the body weight and embryo size of the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) captured from five areas, a refuge dump, a henhouse, a pigpen, shopping and residential quarters in Kanagawa Prefecture, during a period from 1965 to 1940. For the determination of age of rats, molar wears were calculated from wear areas of one upper molar row. The results were summarized as follows; 1) There was a high correlation between the body weight and molar wear in both sexes in each population. According to the regression lines of the log. of body weight on the log. of molar wear, rats from the dump and the henhouse showed the heaviest and others were successively following order; the pigpen, shopping and residential quarters. 2) The pregnant females appeared from about 3.0(mm)^2 or more of molar wear in any populations surveyed. On the other hand, body weights of pregnant females were different in each population, i.e. 160g or more for the dump and the henhouse, 140g or more for the pigpen, 120g or more shopping quarters and 100g or more for residential quarters respectively. 3) The mean embryo size was significantly larger in the dump (9.97) and the hanhouse (9.79) than in the pigpen (8.30) and shopping quarters (8.25). 4) These differences detected would be caused by differences of environmental conditions, especially quantity and quality of foods available and social tension of the population.

N2  - Field examinations were conducted to evaluate effects of the application poison baits (formulations have been improved by Tsuji and Ono, 1969 & 1970) on the field population of the smoky brown cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa, in a mouse breeding room (Station A) and 3 adjacent rooms (Station B, C, & D) in a building near the down town Toyama City. After the bait application (5g granules per 2.5m^2), the population looked markedly decreased and many dead bodies were found in the experimental station. Using a marking method, for example, the population is Station A was estimated at about 5, 000 before the bait application. This dramatically decreased to only about 20 within 6 weeks after the treatment (estimated by the decreasing rate of the dead bodies). The age distribution of the cockroach in Station A was markedly affected by the bait application and the proportion of younger nymphs, especially that of the first instar ones, became strikingly high. This probably is due to the appearance of the first instar nymphs from the oothecae which had already been deposited before the bait application. In Station D, on the other hand, which was 20 meter apart from Station A and was not treated with the bait, the age distribution remained unchanged and almost no cockroaches were found dead. There was a tendency that younger nymphs were found dead near the bait, whereas adults and older nymphs died distant from them. The usual activity range of adults seemed to be within 100m^2, while that of younger nymphs to be more restricted. Therefore it seems possible to control the cockroach even in an arbitrary given area.

N2  - The acaroid mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae has become a common household pest in recent years in Japan as it breeds and reaches to tremendous population densities in "tatami", or the rice straw mats commonly used as the floor material in this country. A series of laboratory and field experiments were carried out for the purpose to find out effective methods for its control by the use of pesticides now available to us. Among various methods tested by us for the control of mites in tatami, the installation of paper sheets impregnated with the pesticides covering the entire upper and lower surfaces was found to be most effective and economical. Among the pesticides tested, fenthion and fenitrothion gave most satisfactory results. As for the fumigants to be applied in a room or the spray materials to be applied directly on the surface of mite-breeding tatami, trichlorobenzene, nitrochlorotoluene, xylenol, phenol and metacresol were shown to be effective at relatively high concentrations.

When the selection continued ; the frequency of type 4-4 decreased, but not falling down to 30% ; that of type 5-4 changed in the opposite direction to that of type 4-4 ; that of type 5-5 fluctuated between 4.5 and 25.4% ; and those of types 4-3 and 3-3 rarely occurred. Viability of the type 5-4 populations did not show an apparent decrease, even though the selection was repeated under the experimental conditions.

N2  - Mosquitoes were collected by light traps equipped with a 6 watt black-light-blue fluorescent lamp, in the National Institute of Animal Industry, Chiba, in the summers of 1967 and 1968. The females of Culex tritaeniorhynchus collected were dissected to determine the physiological age composition. Most of the females collected throughout a night had the follicles of N〜I.II stages, i.e., just before or after feeding. However, the parous rate of the population was higher in the later part of the night ; especially females just after oviposition, which are indicated by sac-like ovarioles, were more abundantly collected in the later part of the night. Also, the physiological age composition of females varied with the environmental conditions at collection sites. The females collected at the place near to the breeding site were observed to have the follicles of various stages at No, N〜I.II, II, III or V, but the follicles in most of the females collected near the pigsties were at N〜I.II stages.

N2  - This study was made to observe the mode of breeding and hypopus formation in Lardoglyphus konoi (Sasa et Asanuma 1951) under the different temperature and relative humidity. About 300 mites were bred in diet which consisted of 4 parts of dried yeast and 6 parts of fish meal powder (niboshi), under the following experimental conditions. A series of relative humidity was prepared using 5 kinds of saturated salt, K_2SO_4(98%), KNO_3(94%), KCl(87%), NaCl(76%) and NH_4NO_3(66%). Each of series was set at 20℃, 25℃, 30℃ and 35℃. In each series of temperature, the highest count of mites were observed under 87% R.H. The Optimum temperature for the breeding of mites was 30℃. The time to reach the highest count of mites was shortest at the 35℃. The counts of escaped mites from diet had a tendency to increase with the total number of the mites in diet. Mites escaped most actively from the diet under the condition at 35℃ and 76% R.H. Hypopi less appeared under unfavorable condition for breeding. The hypopi in the diet appeared most in 94% and 66% R.H. at 30℃ (optimum temperature for breeding), whereas those in the escaping colony were most abundant in 87% R.H. at the same temperature.

N2  - Feeding preference and lethal dosage of Norway rats on warfarin baits were studied in laboratory. The accumulated lethal dosage with 5 day successive feeding of warfarin baits were 3.13-8.00mg/kg and the lethal dosage with one day feeding was 264mg/kg. The feeding preference on 0.03% and 0.1% warfarin baits was equal to non-poisonous bait. This means that their avoidance of warfarin dry baits is not shown, if the concentration is as low as 0.1% or 0.03%. Days necessary to kill the rats by successive feeding of warfarin baits were 3 to 8 days from the initial feeding, independent of the total dose consumed, if the concentration is in the range of 0.03% to 0.1%.

N2  - During the period from July 1968 to August 1970, some species of trombiculid mites, microtigroup and Acomatacarus yosanoi, were collected from the Northern part of Honshu, Japan, which have been considered to be uncommon species in this area. The places of collection recorded are as follows : Neotrombicula pomeranzevi Schluger, 1948 : Fuketsu, Hanaya-cho, Akita Pref. ; Mt. Hakkoda, Aomori Pref. ; Yakeyama, Towada City, Aomori Pref. ; Zato-ishi, Hirosaki City, Aomori Pref. N. microti Ewing, 1928 : Mt. Iwaki and Mt. Hakkoda, Aomori Pref. A. yosanoi Fukuzumi et Obata, 1953 : Mt. Taihei, Akita Pref. In view of the investigations recorded above it can be suggested that the distribution of these species of trombiculid mites are more extensively in Japan.

N2  - Some simple polyols and related compounds were assayed by a filter paper method for the feeding-stimulative effect on the three species of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, P. fuliginosa and Blattella germanica. Glycerol was further tested by a bait method for B. germanica. I. The results obtained by the filter method are as follows. 1) Glycerol is highly effective, but ethylene glycol, 1, 2-propanediol and 1, 3-propanediol are not. 2) The three hydroxyl groups in glycerol, therefore, seem to be essential for the strong activity of this compound. 3) Many compounds with neighboring three or more carbon atoms each of which has a hydroxyl group, especially sugar alcohols, are effective. However, there are also many ineffective stereoisomers among them, especially among sugars (Tsuji, 1965). 4) Therefore, not only the number of hydroxyl groups but the configuration of molecule is also one of the important factors which determine the effectiveness of the compound. 5) It is interesting to know that, a) among aldoses (pentoses and hexoses) Larabinose and D-galactose with the same configuration at C_2-C_3-C_4 were strongly effective for all or one of the three species, whereas other stereoisomers tested were not (Tsuji, 1965); b) glycerol can take all the imaginable arrangements in space of the three hydroxyl groups, and naturally can take the same arrangement of hydroxyl groups as at C_2-C_3-C_4 of L-arabinose; c) the same arrangement of hydroxyl groups as at C_2-C_3-C_4 of L-arabinose can occur more frequently in sugar alcohols than in corresponding aldoses, and many of the sugar alcohols tested were effective, whereas many of the aldoses tested were not effective; d) sorbitol which can take two sequencial sets of the same arrangement of hydroxyl groups as at C_2-C_4-C_4 of L-arabinose was exceptionally effective among the effective sugar alcohols. 6) One possible speculation is that glycerol, the effective sugar alcohols, and the effective aldoses stimulate the receptor of the cockroaches by combining with the same combining site which consists of sequencial sets of structures corresponding in some way to the arrangement in space of hydroxyl groups at C_2-C_3-C_4 of L-arabinose. 7) A few glycerides, including monoolein, triolein and tricaprin, are somewhat effective, though they have not three hydroxyl groups. In these glycerides, the cockroaches seem to respond to specific acyl groups in their structures. II. The results obtained by the poison bait method with the German cockroach show that glycerol is quite effective as a feeding-stimulant in practical poison baits, and is much more effective than maltose, the strongest feeding-stimulative sugar.

The occurrence frequency of the type 4-4 larvae decreased, that of the type 4-3 had once increased and then decreased, and that of the type 3-3 larvae increased, when the selection progressed. These changes in the occurrence frequencies did not occur in one directional way, but with the occational increase or decrease (Fig. 1). Viability of the F'_8 population was too low to produce the next generation (Tables 1 and 2).

N2  - Various methods have been proposed for the detection of mites in stored food, house dust, straw, and other materials with different characters. The authors carried out a seires of experiments with various methods for comparison of the efficiency in the recovery rates of living and dead mites, that in selectivity of mites from other debris, and from standpoint of economy and labour. The methods may be classified into the three categories, (1) those separating the mites by specific gravity of the media, (2) that separating from materials suspended in water by trapping in kerosine, and (3) the classical Berlese's method, or the collection of mites on water surface that escaped from the breeding media heated by eradiation with electric bulb. Two species of mites were used in the present experiments, Tyrophagus putrescentiae and Dermatophagoides farinae, both bred in artificial media. The living mites were marked by adding the dye azur II disolved in alcohol to the culture media (powder of laboratory mouse food), and were collected on water surface by placing the containers of culture media in a dish with water. The marked dead mites were produced by killing the mites on filter paper with heat from infra-red bulb, and by staining with eosine. The saturated NaCl solution with a specific gravity of about 1.2 was found to be an excellent media for separating the living mites from the breeding media either by floatation in Wildman flask, or by centrifugation of debris in centrifuge tubes, but the rates of recovery of dead mites were rather poor. The mites isolated with saturated salt were alive and intact, and could be used for further studies in immunology and biology. Some media with specific gravity of about 1.2, such as the pure lactic acid, glycerine or sugar solution, were found to be as useful but less economic than the saturated salt solution. The use of organic solvent with various specific gravity prepared by mixing carbon tetrachloride and ether were found to be not efficient in separating the mites by floatation, as the media were easy to penetrate into the mite body and gave balanced specific gravities. The classical method using Wildman's flask, mixing the materials with water and separating the mite bodies with kerosine, was found to be excellent also in isolating both living and dead mites from materials such as house dust, when small amount of kerosine such as 1ml to 500ml of water was used. Another classical method of the use of heat from electric bulb on straw and other materials as the media for the breeding of mites was found to be excellent also for separating the living mites under appropriately designed equipments.

N2  - Some experiments were made in order to compare efficiencies in sampling mosquito larvae of two types of dippers, equal in size but different in bottom lining; one is an improved type screened with wire netting at the bottom (Fig.1), and the other is a conventional one. (1) A series of preliminary laboratory experiments were carried out with Culex pipiens pallens larvae. Alternate single-stroke sampling was made repeatedly by two operators with the two different dippers from each of two equal-sized containers, in which 200 larvae in same instar had been released. Average sizes of larval samples collected with the improved dipper (ID samples) were 1.51 to 1.90 times as large as those collected with the conventional one (CD samples) (Table 1). In the similar type of experiments carried out in the field with a mixed population of Culex species, the above values were 3.23 to 3.78 (Table 2). (2) In these experiments, there was no significant difference in the relative frequencies of the component species between ID and CD samples (Fig.2). But, there was a slight difference in age structure of C. tritaneiorhynchus larvae which were dominant at that time; frequencies of the first and second instar larvae in ID samples were somewhat lower than those in CD samples (Fig.3). (3) Such a difference in larval age structure, however, was not observed between ID and CD samples in the case of additional laboratory experiments with C. pipiens pallens larvae (Fig.4). In these experiments, 100 larvae of each instar i. e. 400 in all, were released together in a single container so as to expect equal chance of their being sampled. But the frequencies of the first to third instar larvae were significantly lower than that of the fourth instar in both of ID and CD samples, probably because of their different vertical distributions in water.

N2  - Effects of some organophosphorus insecticides against the last instar larvae of Genji firefly, Luciola cruciata Motschulsky and their prey, Japanese melanial snail, Semisulcospira bensoni Phillipi collected in the streams of Nagato city, Yamaguchi-prefecture were studied in a laboratory and some field tests also carried out. Insecticides used in this study were fenitrothion 10% wettable powder (WP), fenthion 5% WP, ABATE 5% WP and fenthion 5% emulsifiable concentrate (EC). In the laboratory tests, fenitrothion, fenthion WP and ABATE were considered to be practically non-toxic to both firefly larvae and snails. Whereas fenthion EC was apparently toxic to the both species, no significant difference was observed among the toxicity of the three insecticides formulated as wettable powder. In the field tests, application of fenitrothion WP and fenthion WP for control of the larvae of Black fly, Prosimulium hirtipes Fries (stream application of 0.5 to 1.0 ppm of the active ingredients for 10 minutes) was entirely harmless to both firefly larvae and snails in the streams.

N2  - 1. The feeding preference of Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, on poison baits with 4 acute rodenticides, i. e. norbormide, scilliroside, zinc phosphide and thallium sulfate, as well as the killing effect of these rodenticides, was studied in a laboratory. 2. Rats showed poor feeding preference on dry baits with 1% norbormide, resulting in a low mortality of the rats. They appeared to be remarkably shy to the baits of norbormide as high as 0.5% of the toxicant, though only slightly shy to 0.25% baits. Raw sweet potato baits with 1% norbormide were preferred to the dry baits, causing a higher mortality of them. The rats which consumed the dry baits showed rapidly the sign of intoxication. The killing effects of norbormide showed much variation, which was shown by the fact that doses of the toxicant taken by the rats killed and by the survivors were similar; the former 33-100mg/kg and the latter 27-147mg/kg. 3. With 0.017% scilliroside dry baits, rats did not take lethal dose, probably because of their shyness to such a higher concentration of the toxicant. They seemed to show shyness, if the concentration in dry baits is higher than 0.083%. Raw sweet potato baits with 0.017% scilliroside were prefered to the dry baits, causing a higher mortality of them. The rats which consumed a lethal dose of scilliroside were killed 1 to 4 days after feeding. Doses of scilliroside taken by the rats killed were 1.4-4.5mg/kg, and by the survivors were 0.3-1.9mg/kg. 4. With 1% zinc phosphide dry baits, rats did not take lethal dose, probably because of their shyness to such a higher concentration of the toxicant. The action of zinc phosphide was rapid, but its effects were manifested with much variation. Doses of zinc phosphide taken by the rats killed were 65-143mg/kg, and by the survivors were 69-330mg/kg. 5. Rats preferred both dry baits and raw sweet potato baits with thallium sulfate, showing a higher mortality. Shyness to the dry baits was not shown, if the concentration of the toxicant was as low as 0.15%, though they were slightly shy to 0.3% baits. The action of thallium sulfate was slowly manifested; the killing effects appeared 2-5 days after feeding. Doses of thallium sulfate taken by the rats killed were 41-187mg/kg.

N2  - There was monofactorial inheritance of parathion-resistance in larvae of the strain of Culex pipiens pallens that was selected with ethyl-parathion for 18 generations and showed twenty-fold resistance to the selecting insecticide. The factor for parathion-resistance was incompletely dominant and calculated to be linked with a recombination value of 17-20% to the malathion-resistance factor which has been reported to be in linkage group 2.

N2  - The sarcophagid fauna of Japan was published by Kano et al. (1967) including that of the Ryukyus. They reported 2 subfamilies, 18 genera and 70 species, but besides their report, 2 species, Blaesoxipha filipjevi and Pierretia olsoufjevi, have reported by Kurahashi (1964) and Buei (1965) respectively. In the present paper, the authors described and illustrated 3 new species of sarcophagid flies, Heteronychia nipponensis, Blaesoxipha ampliforceps and Blaesoxipha amamiensis, from the main island of Japan and Amami-oshima Island.

N2  - In this paper manifesting the seasonal prevalence and natural infection of the vector mosquitoes of Japanese encephalitis virus in the Fukuoka area in 1966, the results obtained from Uchihashi and Ae, Kasuya-gun, and Mitsuzawa, Mii-gun, were compared each other and additionally with the result obtained from Kanatake, Fukuoka City, in the same year (Yamamoto et al., 1968b). Furthermore, the correlation between mosquito factors and the size of epidemics was preliminarily discussed. With some exceptions, there was an approximate similarity in time and pattern of mosquito infection among the different study sites. A prior infection of the vector mosquitoes was evidenced at Ae but not at the other study sites. Despite of the fact that the epidemic of Japanese encephalitis was far larger in size in 1966 than in other years, the mosquito infection encountered in 1966 was similar in essential pattern and in the proportion of infected to total populations to those in other years. The annual difference of mosquito infection was recognized only in the time of occurrence. This fact probably suggests that the annual variation in the density of infected populations of the vector mosquitoes was mainly attributable to the difference in time of infection but not to that in infection rate. Thus, the annual variation in the time of mosquito infection would attach a great importance to the epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis.

N2  - Segregation of the siphonal hair types in the type 4-3 population of Culex pipiens molestus was observed from F_1 through F_<10>. The occurrence frequency of the type 4-4 larvae decreased and those of the type 4-3 and 3-3 larvae increased as the selection progressed. However, the occurrence of the type 4-4 larvae will not be expected to reach to zero, even though the selection is continued further. The fertile egg raft ratio, number of larvae produced per egg raft and mortality during larval period under the experimental conditions were observed, which did not show an apparent change during the selection experiment.

N2  - Laboratory observations were carried out with a colony of Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, on the amount of consumption of various forms and compositions of dry baits to be used as the base of rodenticides. The animals used were a laboratory colony which had been bred and maintained by us from commensal rats. The feeding preference was tested by comparing the amount of consumption of two different kinds of baits set at the same time in a cage, and the position of baits were frequently changed alternatively so as to eliminate the effects of place preference. As the results, it was demonstrated that the rats preferred wheat flour to corn meal; the addition of fish meal at a rate of 1% or less as well as that of rice bran to 5% or less to the bait did not cause significant differences in the amount of food consumption; baits incorporated with 3 to 6% of vegetable oil were highly preferred by the rats, while liquid paraffine had no such effect; the addition of a synthetic sweetener sodium cyclohexylsulfamate also did not enhance the food consumption. As to the forms of the dry baits, cylinder type was preferred to biscuit type, and cylinder type baits of 0.4 to 0.5g in weight was found to be best preferred.

N2  - 1) In the present study, a newly devised ethyl ether/carbon-tetrachloride mixed solvent floatation-fractionation method was developed for the extraction of the mites in the house-dust, and the extractive efficiency of this method was estimated. The most extractive fraction was IV (1.5>specific gravity≧1.45), and the accumulative composition from I to V was 96.8% in number of the mites. According to the divergency of the mite fauna, however, the most extractive fraction varied from II to V. Of all mites extracted, live mites with the appearence of complete shape was composed of 11.3%. The problems of the extraction method of the house-dust were raised comparing the present method with Spieksm's method. 2) The mite fauna of the house-dust, collected from eight districts of Japan and one of Taiwan, were examined. The entire mites number collected from nine samples of one-gramme unit material was in total 9, 489, for one unit sample, 1, 054.3 in average varying from 435 to 2, 050. The mites belonging to Pyroglyphidae Cunliffe, 1958 were classified into five species, Mealia pteronyssina, M. passericola, M. farinae, Euroglyphus maynei and Malayoglyphus intermedius, and were not only present in all samples but the largest in composition, 43.5% in average. The glycyphagid mites, Glycyphagus privatus, Chortoglyphus arcuatus and Blomia sp., were dominant in three samples, respectively. As a whole, more than 36 species of the mites referable to 17 families were distinguished. Of all of them, some were considered indigenous species as characteristic house-dust dwellers or their predators, another were considered incidental intruders. 3) With some Numerical Taxonomic Methods, these nine mite fauna were compared and classified. It was recognized a relationship in the similarities among the mite fauna, and it could be evaluated and classified by that Methods. 4) The significance of the mites and their excrements in the house-dust as the inhalant allergen to the house-dust sensitive patients with brochial asthma was discussed. The cross- and specific antigenicity of the mites, which are seen in the clinical studies, were accounted for in connection with the mite fauna of the house-dust.

N2  - The gonotrophic dissociation in Culex tritaeniorhynchus was commonly observed when mosquitose were exposed to out-door conditions in autumn through early winter, even if the larvae were maintained at high temperature and long day. The ratio of the gonotrophic dissociation in mosquitoes experienced out-door conditions from the pupal stage increased in accordance with the advance of the seasons. Mosquitoes transferred to the out-door after the emergence into adults showed neither the high ratio nor the seasonal elevation of the gonotrophic dissociation. Four types of the follicle development were designated by the observation : the complete absence of the follicle development (complete gonotrophic dissociation), the suppression of the follicle maturation (incomplete gonotrophic dissociation), the maturation of one or a few number of follicles (incomplete gonotrophic concordance) and the complete maturation of a number of follicles (complete gonotrophic concordance). The temperature at the time of pupal stage was not linearly correlated with the ratio of the gonotrophic dissociation indicating that other factors are relating on the appearence of the phenomenon. The photoperiod was considered to be the most regulative factor other than the temperature.

N2  - The majority of resting C. p. fatigan adult do not move much in daytime, but it becomes restless during 18.00-19.00 hr. The density in morning and afternoon, as well as the density in daytime and 19.00-22.00 hr. were similar values. However, no correlation was found in the number caught in each house in daytime and 19.00-22.00 hr., though it correlated between morning and afternoon. Number of occupants, construction type of houses and size of house could not be correlated significantly with the resting density. The distance of the houses from the breeding site was significantly related to the number of resting mosquitoes, as more resting ones were collected at the short distance houses from the breeding places. Observations on resting showed that 44.1-60.3% of mosquitoes were on hangings. Then 58.9-63.9% of the detected population were collected using a sucking tube in 5 minutes. Three different periods of spending time per house, 5, 10 and 15 minutes, do not give significant difference in the density. One hour catch can give 2.6 to 4.8 times of mosquitoes of 5 minutes collection. Removal method to estimate the absolute population in a house was tested. Total estimated was about 3 times of the first 5 minutes catch. By comparison of the biting and resting catch, it is found that the number caught at each house by resting collection does not correspond to the number biting in the house. However there is a relationship between the resting density of an area and the biting density there. A comparison between random sampled houses and total houses examination was made. There is no significant difference regarding the density, but not enough female adults to determine filaria infection rate were available from the random collection. Therefore, 100 houses were selected, to that sufficient adults could be obtained to dissect, although this catch is not a true measurement of the overall density of the population of C. p. fatigans of the area. Rough resting density was indicated through the study of negative house ratio and male proportion in an area.

N2  - Field tests were made to evaluate the effects of the wide application of tabletized or granulated baits compounded in the same way as previously reported (Tsuji and Ono 1969) on field populations of the German cockroach at 5 stations. Population surveys at 4 stations gave the following results. 1) Considerable increases in mortality of cockroaches were produced by the bait treatments, while the bait removal tried at a station gradually decreased the mortality. 2) After the bait treatments, populations markedly declined within 2 weeks at 3 stations, and within 3 weeks at another. 3) The proportion of nymphs to total cockroaches was always exceptionally large in rapidly growing populations, and the bait treatments had no common effect on the age distribution in all populations. The bait treatment was effective in controlling the German cockroach also at another station where no trap survey was made. Further improvements of the baits seem to prepare one of the hopeful approaches to cockroach control in future.

Esterase activity of the 4th instar larvae revealed by β-naphthylacetate hydrolysis was separated into 4 bands. Diazinon-resistant colonies showed marked higher E_2 and E_3 esterase activities than susceptible strain. The E_2 or E_3 esterase has an ability to hydrolyse phenylacetate and methyl-n-butyrate, but not acetylcholine.

N2  - In order to observe some ecological habits on seasonal oviposition and ovarian development of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus, laboratory surveys and experiments were made with wild-caught engorged mosquitos which were collected every month by a light-trap in a pigpen in the suburb of Yokohama during the periods from June to September 1968 and 1969. The survey on the seasonal oviposition was performed with adult females isolated individually in glass pots, 8cm high and 9cm in diameter, while 30-50 females were kept in a cage of 30cm cube as a control of the single rearing. The mosquitos were reared under uncontrolled climatic conditions and divided into two lots of the sugar water supply with respective concentrations of 0.5 and 5.0%. The sugar solution was renewed every day or on alternative days. In the single rearing it was found that in the mosquitos given 5% sugar solution only 60-70% of those oviposited by the 7th day after rearing in June and July as compared with about 90% in the 0.5% sugar lot. It was accordingly obvious that ovipositing activities in the former were more delayed than those of the latter. In August and September, however, there was no significant difference between the two lots in their ovipositing processes and, especially in September, all the females laid rafts during the shortest period within 8-11 days after rearing. On the contrary, in the cases of mass rearing in cages, ovipositing activities were very much delayed even in the mosquitos fed on 0.5% sugar solution compared with those of the single rearing. Also in the cases of single rearing, the oviposition rates of lots given 0.5% and 5% sugar solutions were calculated as 94.2% and 96.2% respectively on the averages throughout the seasons from June to September. The average egg numbers per raft of primipars were counted as 233.3 eggs for the 0.5% sugar lot and 239.3 eggs for the 5% one respectively. Since these differences were not significant, it was suggested that sugar solution did not affect the oviposition and egg formation of mosquitos engorged. Twenty five per cent of the females retained eggs after the oviposition without any relation to the sugar concentration and, in some cases, "separate oviposition" could be seen in the females which had a great number of retaining eggs after their first and incomplete oviposition, i.e. these mosquitos laid rafts twice or thrice up to the complete oviposition of all their retaining eggs. Including laboratory oviposition, biparous or multiparous females of the wild-caught mosquitos increased seasonally, being the rates 3.2%, 6.1%, 40.5% and 64.4% in respective month of June through September. The survey on the ovarian development after feeding on mice were performed using F_1 females reared in the laboratory from rafts obtained from the wild-caught mosquitos. The gonotrophic dissociation appeared in almost the same patterns from the former report (Harada et al., 1968) and, regardless to the sugar concentration, 70-80% of the females emerged in late August or early September failed to develop their ovaries after the blood meal. It was reconfirmed consequently that, in nature, the larvae which will give rise to hibernating females start their life at a day length of 13 hr or less in Yokohama area. In the adult females which were put continuously in an insectary (28-30℃) from the pupal stage, however, only about 17% failed to develop their ovaries even under the short photoperiod of 12 hours owing probably to the high temperatures during the pupal and adult stages.

N2  - A series of field investigations were carried out during the summer of 1967 in a village in Okayama Prefecture on the resting behavior of the adult mosquitoes of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus Dyar, 1920, the principal vector of Japanese encephalitis in Japan. A special type of cubic mosquito net traps (exactly 1.5 meters square in size) were constructed by covering the top and the side walls of frame works with white cloth, with the bottom left open. The traps were set at different times of a day on various types of possible resting places, such as thickets near pigsties, sweet potato fields and rice paddies. A large sucking tube connected with a vacuum sweeper operated by a portable electric generator (Honda Super-watt-300) was used for catching the adult mosquitos from inside of the mosquito net trap, and the population density per 1.5m^2 as well as their composition at certain times of a day in certain resting places was recorded. Laboratory and field studies with other methods were carried out also to supplement the information necessary for estimating the daily rhythm of their activities. As a result, it has been shown that the adults of this species of mosquito are nocturnal in activity as the principle, and take various types of vegetations as their daytime resting places, especially under low and flat leaves of densely growing plants, such as in sweet potato and strawberry fields. The adults were found to emerge from pupae at night with a peak at about the midnight, and the newly emerged males and females mostly stayed on nearby plants at least until the next morning. The mating was estimated to take place on the second night, the blood sucking of females in or after the third night, and the first oviposition during the sixth or the following nights. The females successfully engorged with blood were found to be resting during the night on nearby thickets, but moved to more suitable daytime resting places at dawn such as under leaves of thickly vegetated sweet potato fields. Large numbers of both males and females (including all gonotrophic stages) were found to be resting during the daytime in such a type of vegetations, but most of them flew away into the air after the sunset.

N2  - An ecological study was made on the larval population of mosquitoes in Nagoya district, central part of Japan, from July to November in 1967. The purpose of this report is to elucidate population dynamics of important species in a paddy field and irrigation ponds from the view point of seasonal change of population size and larval age structure, and to estimate relative abundance of newly emerged adults at population level. 1) The number of larvae and pupae sampled from a paddy field was 5, 238, of which 83% were Culex tritaeniorhychus, 16% Anopheles sinensis and the rest were Culex orientalis, Culex vishnui and Culex pipiens pallens in descending order of abundance (Table 1). In irrigation ponds, 19, 024 individuals were caught ; nearly all of which (97%) were C. tritaeniorhynchus and the rest were C. pipiens pallens, A. sinensis and C. vishnui in descending order (Table 2). 2) In the paddy field, the larval population of C. tritaeniorhynchus was observed from July to September, and the population size reached its peak at the middle of July (Table 1). The change of larval age structure had been analyzed, and adult emergence at population level was thought to occur at least four times, of which the first one (early to middle July) was estimated to be the largest on the basis of the foregoing abundance of the fourth instar larvae and pupae (Fig. 3). In the irrigation ponds, the larval population of the same species was observed from the last part of June to the first part of October and a sharp peak of the population size appeared later in July (Table 2). During the period, adult emergence at population level was recognized four times, of which the second one (middle to later July) was the largest (Fig. 4). 3) The larval population of A. sinensis was observed from July to the middle of October, and a peak of population size appeared later in July (Table 1). During the season, adult emergence at population level occurred five times, of which the first one (early to middle July) was the largest (Fig. 3).

N2  - A description was presented of two kinds of artificial devices which were found useful in feeding for biting midges and mosquitoes on blood and virus suspensions. 1) A feeder invented for Culicoides puncticollis was a dome-shaped cage made of nylon cloth attached to the edge of a celluloid ring 8.5cm in diameter. The bottom of the ring was covered with a piece of gauze. A group of biting midges which was introduced in this cage fed with a highly engorged ratio through the gauze which had been put upon absorbent cotton impregnated with some blood containing sucrose and African horse-sickness virus suspension. 2) A device invented for mosquitoes was composed of a cage and a tube introducing circulating warm water for the maintenance of temperature. A membrane derived from the crop of a chicken covered the surface of the tube. The cavity between the tube and the membrane was filled with liquid for feeding. Blood containing Japanese encephalitis virus virus was fed efficiently by females of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus through the membrane having a wide surface area than those of the streched membrane types.

N2  - Twenty arthropod species found in nests of the Japanese house martin, Delichon urbica, were presented in Table 2. Among these, blood-sucking ectoparasites, free-living Psocoptera and nidicolous mite, Dermatophagoides passericola, were abundant. The fauna also contained predatory species such as cheyletid and bdellid mites in considerable numbers. Further nest examinations will add to the fauna numerous species including parasites on the birds and other arthropods which may be carried accidentally either by the birds or with nest materials. Because of the close association of the nest sites to houses, some arthropods have been reported to creep into the room and at times regarded as nuisant pests. In this respect, moderate sized species such as fleas, hippoboscid fly and argasid tick have already been incriminated. However, medical significance of Psocoptera, blood-sucking and nidicolous mites occasionally found in the nests have so far been ignored, since they are scarcely noticed. The fairly durable nests of D. urbica are used repeatedly during the successive breeding seasons. This may furnish the nest dwelling arthropods with favorable external conditions to propagate themselves. It is recommended to remove the nests built on houses during the overwintering season of the birds for depopulating the remaining arthropods. Insecticides may be applied additionlly on the cleared nest sites.

N2  - In order to analyze molar wear for age determination, the albinos, Rattus norvegicus albinus, have been reared in small cages with rats-mice crackers and some vegetables for two years since May 1966. Fifty five of them (♂21, ♀34) which were 1 to 24 months old were used successively in this study. The anterior crown height of the lower first molar was measured tentatively and it was found that the crown height decreased in inverse proportion to age in months, but there was too large deviation in each age group to be used for age determination. On the contrary, there was a large correlation between wear-area of one upper molar (Y__-, in square mm) and log of age in months (X__-), showing the coefficients 0.946 for males and 0.963 for females respectively. Regression lines of Y__- on X__- were as follows : male Y__-=4.61X__-+1.68 female Y__-=3.98X__-+1.57 It must be considered, however, that the deviation was larger in old rats than in young one, e.g. wear-area (within the (mm^2) rat age in months range of S. E.) 2.5 1.1-2.0 male 2.5 1.3-2.2 female 6.5 8.4-14.8 male 6.5 13.6-22.2 female

N2  - A new synergistic substance named Tropital was studied with three pyrethroids to the Takatsuki strain of the housefly, Musca domestica vicina Macqu. Tropital showed the practical synergistic activity for pyrethrins but the degree of increase in toxicity was not so remarkable as in the case of piperonyl butoxide.

N2  - Nine species of biting lice have been reported from domestic fowls in Japan (Table 2). But many investigators have used different genera and specific names; scientific names of them have been in a strongly confused state. Since 1963 H.I.H. Prince Hitachi has collected many specimens of biting lice from domestic fowls in Chiba Prefecture. These were examined in detail and eight species belonging to six genera were identified (Table 1); all the species have already been reported by Japanese investigators. In the present paper redescriptions and drawings of these lice were presented.

N2  - Descriptions of five species of the horse-fly pupae (Tabanidae) were given. These pupae were collected from humus soil under defoliating trees, swampy places or banks of the streamlets of Karuizawa and Sugadaira, Nagano Prefecture. Stenomyia yezoensis (Shiraki), Hybomitra jersey (Takahasi) and Tabanus fulvimedioides Shiraki were hitherto undescribed. A detailed description on the pupa of T. chrysurus Loew has never been published although a brief note was made by Ohmori & Saito (1964). The structure of the pupa of T. sapporoensis Shiraki, which was described by Ogawa (1959), is significantly different from that of ours, viz., in the former the body surface is sculpture with transverse striation while in the latter with net work.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the efficacy of an established attractant (methylmyristate) and feeding stimulants (starch, maltose, and sucrose), and the iesecticidal activity of boric acid as the constituents of baits for cockroach control. Starch (25 to 70%) and soluble starch (10 to 25%) were used as the basic constituents of the baits. The experiments were done at a constant temperature of 25±1℃. The results with the German conckroach were as follows. 1) When administered orally, boric acid showed no chemical repellency against the insects. 2) A single-day exposure of the insects to baits containing boric acid was enough to kill most of them, though the fed amount of boric acid was slowly effective. In a continuous exposure of the insects to the baits, 6.6mg of boric acid taken by 30 female adults could kill them all within a month, and the more the intake of boric acid was the shorter the duration necessary for killing the insects. Thus it is likely that all or at least most of the insects respond to their food every night. 3) When the water solutions were delivered from the needle of a syringe directly on to the mouthparts of young adults, (LD)_<50> values of about 150μg of boric acid per male insect and 200μg per female were expected. In this case mortality did not increase from the 11th day after the application. 4) The addition of methylmyristate to the bait clearly increased the amount of bait ingested by the insects at the optimum dose from 0.02 to 0.2%. The insects preferred the maltose-containing bait much more than the sucrose-contatining one especially at the higher concentrations of 10 and 15%. 5) Mortality by the bait with 0.5% lindane or fenitrothion in addition to 20% boric acid initially increased at a much more rapid rate than those without these insecticides, but especially with fenitrothion complete mortality resulted Afferward. 6) A wide distribution of the bait was more effectual for rapid control of the insect populations even in small test containers, and the baits were effective for controlling the insects even when there was a greater amount of another food which the insects could feed freely.

N2  - The seasonal prevalence of moth flies breeding in a rural area of Yokohama was surveyed during the period from June to October in 1967 and all the year in 1968. Collection of the adult moth flies was made by black-light traps (Nozawa type) in two pigpens and a henhouse. Among the four species collected, T. albipunctatus and P. alternata were most common in this area. T. albipunctatus was collected successively during the period from May to December and it was most abundant in August in 1968 and September in 1967. Also P. alternata was common throughout the year of 1968 and three peaks in prevalence were seen in three seasons, May, June to July, and September to October; the highest among them was observed during the period from June to July.

N2  - As a case of insect nuisances of summer season two kinds of the moth flies, Psychoda alternata Say and Telmatoscopus albipunctatus Williston, which are common in various districts of Kanagawa Prefecture, was in vestigated. The life history of Telmatoscopus albipunctatus was observed in the laboratory by dry yeast feeding under the conditions of 27℃, 85% relative humidity and L12 : D12 in photoperiodism. The egg period was 2 days, larval stages ranged 10-14 days (I, II, III and IV instar periods), pupal period was 3 days and adult life lasted from 2 days to 20 days (average 7 days). Preoviposition period was 3 days, and the total number of eggs per one female was considered to be 250. Relative effectiveness of 9 insecticides was tested against larvae of Telmatoscopus albipunctatus by the dilution immersion method with suspending filter papers. The LC 50 values were 0.26ppm for Baytex, 0.81ppm for Sumithion, 1.9ppm for Dipterex, 4.3ppm for Malathion, 5.2ppm for Lindane, 8.5ppm for DDVP, 9.1ppm for DDT and 71ppm for Sevin. It was obvious that the moth fly (Telmatoscopus albipunctatus) larvae have, in general, resistance levels to the insecticides tested. It is, therefore suggested that chemical control measure of the adult moth flies, in in practice desirable.

N2  - The joint toxicities of pyrethroids were tested against the Takatsuki strain of the housefly (Musca domestica vicina). The co-toxicity coefficients of mixtures were calculated by using the Sun-method (1950). The co-toxicity coefficient of an insecticide-mixture [numerical formula] When the coefficient of a mixture indicates about 100, it showns similar joint action. If the coefficient is less than 100, it seems to be independent action. In the case of a significant value above 100, it indicates synergism. While it is significantly less than 100, it shows antagonism. The mixtures of chrythron plus allethrin and chrythron plus phthalthrin showed high synergistic action. Chrythron was more effective than allethrin and phthalthrin.

N2  - 1. Four species of pentastomids were represented in collections from snakes from Malaysia, Taiwan, Amami Oshima, and Korea examined at the 406th Medical Laboratory, U.S. Army Medical Command, Japan, during the period 1964-66. 2. Raillietiella orientalis (Hett, 1915) Sambon, 1922, was taken for the first time from : Agkistrodon rhodostoma (Boie) from the Malaysian mainland opposite Penang; Trimeresurus flavoviridis flavoviridis (Hallowell) from Amami Oshima; Dinodon semicarinatum (Cope) from Amami Oshima; and Natrix pryeri pryeri (Boulenger) from Amami Oshima. It was also taken from Vipera russelli (Shaw) and Naja naja atra Cantor from Taiwan. 3. Kiricephalus pattoni (Stephens, 1908) Sambon, 1910, was taken from Ptyas mucosus (L.), Opheodrys major major (Guenther), Elaphe taeniura taeniura (Cope), and Zaocys dhumnades (Cantor). All hosts were from Taiwan. Nymphs tentatively identified as those of K. pattoni were found encysted in a lizard, Japalura swinhonis Guenther, and a toad, Bufo bankorensis Barbour, to which eggs of K. pattoni had been given by mouth 90 days previously. Since both hosts had been captured as adults on Taiwan, there was no assurance that these collections represented experimental infections. 4. Armillifer agkistrodontis Self and Kuntz, 1966, was taken from two specimens of the pit viper Agkistrodon acutus (Guenther) on Taiwan. 5. A male adult or nymph of an undetermined species of genus Waddycephalus Sambon, 1922, was taken from the body cavity of Dinodon rufozonatum rufozonatum (Cantor) from Seoul, Korea. This was the first record of a member of the genus in Korea. 6. Identifying characteristics of the species collected were illustrated and discussed. Eggs of Raillietiella orientalis, Kiricephalus pattoni, and Armillifer agkistrodontis had never before been illustrated.

N2  - 1. Monofactorial inheritance of resistance to malathion and fenthion was proved in the colony of Culex p. pallens which showed 13-fold resistance to malathion and 50-fold resistance to fenthion after 10 generations of the larval selection with malathion and 5 further generations with fenthion; the factors for malathion- and fenthion-resistance were incompletely dominant. 2. Genetical linkage relationships were investigated between malathion-resistance and fenthion-resistance in this colony; the results show that a malathion-resistance factor is located at crossover distances of 48-50% from ru on chromosome 2, though of 40-43% from ru in the previous study, and of 12-15% from the fenthion-resistance factor linked to ru with a 48% crossover unit.

N2  - Laboratory tests were carried out to compare the resistance levels of the 4th instar larvae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus collected from four areas (Hodogaya, Misaki, Fujisawa and Sagamihara) in Kanagawa Prefecture. By the examination on number and shape of comb scales in the larval stage it was recongnized that there was no Culex pseudovishnui in the test populations. Fifteen kinds of test insecticides may be divided into four groups in the investigation of their efficacy : 1) Abate and EPN. 2) DDT, Baytex (fenthion), diazinon and Sumithion (fenitrothion). 3) Nankor (ronnel), Dipterex and malathion. 4) dimethoate, dieldrin and lindane. The efficacy of Sevin and PCP were far inferior to above chemicals. Influence of the temperature on the susceptibility was tested by using three effective insecticides, Baytex, EPN and DDT. The effectiveness of Baytex and EPN to larvae increased at the high temperature, on the contrary DDT became less effective when the test insects were placed at the high temperature. It is noteworthy that test colonies showed higher resistance levels especially to DDT and lindane than the levels had ever been reported in Japan.

N2  - The fine structure of small intestine (or ileum), rectum (or colon) and rectal papillae of the adult female Aedes aegypti were observed by the electron microscopy. The thin two-layer cuticles (Fig. 5, Cul, Cu2) are found on the luminal surface of small intestine and rectum. The outer (Cu1) of these two-layer cuticles is electron dense and the inner (Cu2) is less electron dense. The rectal papillae have a electron dense cuticle and a sponge-like layer (Fig. 1, 6, arrow) which lies between the cuticle and the epithelial cells, but this observation reveals no sponge-like layer. The small intestine has thick epithelium, but the rectum is characterized by thin epithelium having a few infoldings or none. There are many long infoldings of the epithelial cell membrane which project deep into the cytoplasm from the luminal and the outer sides of these epithelial cell. Each of these folds are arranged in parallel with the endoplasmic reticulum-like structure, and the vesicle-like bulge is seen in these infoldings in some portion. The infoldings of the epithelial cell membrane of small intestine and rectal papillae increase in the area of the epithelial cell surface. The mitochondria lie between these infoldings here and there. These morphological features of the rectum suggest that the rectum epithelial cell is not the site of absorption but the small intestine and the rectal papillae are the site of absorptive activity of the mosquito hindgut.

N2  - A selection experiment for increasing the siphonal index of the larvae of Culex pipiens molestus (originally collected in Sendai, for the habitat and larval character of the mosquito, see Kato and Ishii (1968) and Ishii (1967c) was carried out for 6 generations under experimental conditions. For details of the rearing conditions, see Ishii (1969). A sibling population was used for a unit of the selection and the siphonal length and width and the siphonal hair tuft of the exuviae of the fourth instar larvae were measured or counted through generations. Data concerned with rearing mosquitoes are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Table 2 and Figs. 1-4 summarize the maximum, minimum and mean values and standard errors of the characters studied. The frequency distributions of the parent population (thin line) and average frequency distribution of the progeny populations (thick line) are illustrated in Figs. 1-4 for the four characters studied. The significance of the difference between the average value of the character of the parent and the maximum or minimum value among average values of the character of the progeny populations was tested with t-test and results are summarized in Table 3. The maximum average value of the siphonal length among the sibling populations is 1.3707mm (SE=0.0130mm). And when such a population as that showing the maximum average value mentioned above is used as a parent, the siphonal length of the resulting populations is significantly shorter than that of the parent or no significant difference between them is observed. A similar result is observed with the siphonal index, in which the maximum average value is 4.516 (SE=0.108). For the siphonal width, the selection method employed in this study seems not to be effective. The average value of the number of the siphonal hair tufts fluctuated between 8.04 and 9.00. No definite direction of the change of the number is observed in this study. From the above, it may be that no or low relation between the changes of the siphonal index and the number of the siphonal hair tufts is expected. The viability of a population that has a high average value of the siphonal index is low (Table 4) : the difference between the average numbers of the first instar larvae per egg raft of F_1, F_2, and F_3′ (the average siphonal index is lesser than 4.1) and F_2′, F_3, F_4′, F_5, and F_6 (the average value is larger than 4.1) is significant at 5% level (t=2.589, 0.025>P>0.010).

N2  - In the study on population dynamics of mosquito larvae, it is necessary to know about age structure of larval population as well as population size. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate which of the following six morphological characters-head width, body length, siphon length, number of labial teeth, of lateral scales and of pecten teeth-is suitable for determination of larval ages (instars) of mosquitoes. The results obtained are as follows : 1) As to the larvae reared individually, the most suitable characters for determination of instars are both head width and siphon length in Culex pipiens s. 1. and head width in Aedes albopictus. The conclusion was made in the following way : Observation was made on each datum of the six characters mentioned above and four frequency distributions were found. These distributions, representing the normal patterns, corresponded to four larval stages; from the first to the fourth instars, respectively (Fig. 2). Then, suitability of these characters for determination of larval instars was tested quantitatively by means of the "instar determination index" as defined below : D(r-1)・r=(the lower rejection limit (α=0.05) of frequency distribution for a certain character of the rth instar)/(the upper rejection limit for the same character of the (r-1)th instar) When the index for a certain character is over 1 (namely, two adjacent distributions of the character are separated from each other), (r-1)th and rth instars can be distinguished; and the larger the index, the more reliable the determination by this character (Table 2). 2) In C. pipiens s. 1. and A. albopictus, four frequency distributions were distinguished in measurements of larval head width of outdoor populations as well as of laboratory colonies reared individually. When arranged in the order of size as shown in figure 3, each of the four distribution ranges (value of mean±rejection limits at 5% level) of the outdoor population agreed well with the corresponding range of the laboratory colony, in which the four larval instars coincided exactly with the four frequency distributions (Fig. 3 and Tables 2, 3). This result suggests that the four frequency distributions of larval head width in the outdoor population obviously correspond to the four larval instars, and that instars of certain larvae of these species can be distinguished by comparing their values of head width with the preliminarily measured ranges of the outdoor larval populations of the same species. 3) Four clear-cut frequency distributions were observed in measurements of larval head width in outdoor populations of the following eleven species : Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex vishnui, Culex orientalis, Culex pipiens s.l., Culex pipiens molestus, Culex vorax, Aedes albopictus. Aedes togoi, Aedes japonicus and Tripteroides bambusa. And the instar determination indices of larval head width calculated as written above were over 1 with no exception (Fig. 4 and Table 3). This suggests that head width is a suitable character for determination of instars of mosquito larvae of at least eleven species belonging to four genera. In addition, this seems to be equally true of Armigeres subalbatus and Uranotaenia bimaculata. The early-instar larvae of these species, however, were not collected during the present investigation. 4) When the logarithmic values of larval head width (y) were plotted against instar (x) in all the species mentioned above, they fell on straight lines, to which the following general formula gave a good fit : log y=a+bx (a, b : constants) (Fig. 5 and Table 4). This fact suggests that larval head width of most species of mosquitoes increases exponentially after each ecdysis and remains with little growth during the stadium. The regularity in growth of larval head width in all the species inspected gives an additional evidence that larval head width is most suitable for determination of instars. Such a regularity in growth was not observed as to five other characters. 5) In determining instars of larvae sampled from outdoor populations of different habitats, however, it is advisable to compare not only the value of larval head width but also that of other reliable characters with the preliminarily measured ranges. Siphon length of C. pipiens s.l., for example, is equally suitable for this purpose, as shown by scatter diagram (Fig. 6 and Table 2).

N2  - Studies were carried out to analyze the fluctuating factors on evaluating the effect in the Peet-Grady tests, using five colonies of the house fly, Musca domestica vicina. Generally speaking, older flies tend to rest on the floor or lower sides of the inner surface of the chamber, and younger flies rest on the ceiling or upper sides. The resting habit depends remarkably on the characteristic of the colony used in the tests. In any colony tested, ratio of resting on the ceiling is higher in males than in females. The susceptibility to pyrethroids evaluated by topical application tests is different from each other in colonies used in the present studies. Hokota and Shibokuchi colonies were less susceptible than the other three colonies, i. e. Lab em 7 em, Denken and Nakafukura. But, the effects of pyrethroids evaluated by the Peet-Grady tests in five colonies were proved not to be parallel to the susceptibility in topical application tests. According to the modified Peet-Grady tests, in which the flies were confined in small screen cages and located in various sites in the chamber, the percentage knockdown or mortality was not uniform. It was highest in the low corner faced directly to the output of the aerosol can, higher in the diagonal corner to the output, and lower in the other sites. The difference in the percentage knockdown was larger in oil-base aerosols than in water-base ones. This facts suggests that water-base type can distribute the aerosols in the chamber more uniformly than oil-base type. By summarizing the data given in the present studies, it was concluded that a lot of factors were responsible for the percentage knockdown or mortality in the Peet-Grady tests, and any one of particular factors was not decisive.

N2  - A colony of Culex tritaeniorhynchus highly resistant to dieldrin was collected in Okayama, western Japan, in September 1967. Since it had been known that wild populations of this species of mosquitoes were usully difficult to be colonized in the laboratories but that hybrids were easily established by the crosses between the wild males and the laboratory adapted females, crossing experiments were carried out with the Okayama males and 406 colony females, which were dieldrin susceptible and had been maintained as laboratory colonies for several years. The hybrid colony was successfully established, and apparently homozygous resistant colony (RR) was established by selecting the hybrid colony with dieldrin for 6 generations, the LC-50 being 0.15 ppm, which was approximately 100 times higher than the SS colony. Crossing experiments were carried out between the RR colony and the 406 colony, which was purely susceptible (SS) to dieldrin. The ld-p line (log dosage-probit mortality regression line) of F1 was a straight line located intermediate between two lines, i.e. RR and SS. (See Fig. 3) The results of F2 show distinct evidence of segregation into susceptible, hybrid and resistant individuals in 1 : 2 : 1 ratio, as witnessed by plateaus at the 25% and 75% mortality level in the ld-p line. (See Fig. 4) The results of both backcrosses show distinct evidence of segregation in 1 : 1 ratio, as witnessed by a plateau at the 50% mortality level in the ld-p line. (See Fig. 5) Investigation of the mode of inheritance of dieldrin-resistance in C. trit. larvae has given results entirely consistent with monofactorial inheritance by an autosomal gene of intermediate dominance.

N2  - A series of experiments were carried out for selecting strains either resistant or susceptible to the organophosphorus insecticide "diazinon" from a laboratory colony of the mosquito Culex pipiens molestus, and for elucidating the mode of inheritance of such characters. A homozygous resistant colony (RR) was established by collecting larvae that survived the exposure to concentrations showing the mortality higher than 60 percent at each generation, rearing them to the next generation, and by repeating such selections for 8 generations, after which no further increase in the resistance could be observed. In selecting the susceptible colony, larvae hatched from single egg rafts were separately reared to the fourth stage, and 15 larvae from each lot were tested with media containing a discriminating concentration of 0.15 to 0.05ppm. The rest larvae of the lots showing high susceptibility were collected and reared to the next generation. A homozygous susceptible colony (SS) was established by repeating such selection for 4 generations. Crossing experiments were carried out between the RR and the SS strains. The F1 hybrids both RS and SR, showed similar susceptibility level intermediate between the parents but closer to RR. The F2 hybrid was estimated to be composed of a mixture of SS, SR and RR at the ratio of 1 : 2 : 1, as shown by the presence of a plateau at the 25% mortality level and a turning point at the 75% level of the ld-p line. In the back crosses between RR and RS or SR, as well as between SS and RS or SR, altogether in 8 combinations, a plateau and a turning point were observed at the 50% mortality level, indicating that the populations were seggregated into the homozygous (RR or SS) and the heterozygous (RS or SR) individuals by the ratio of 1 : 1. The above results suggest that the diazinon resistance in larvae of Culex pipiens molestus is apparently due to a simple monofactorial inheritance by an autosomal gene of partial dominance. It was further elucidated that the ratio of susceptible individual in a population of the mosquito could be estimated directly by the mortality in the tests with 0.05-0.15ppm of diazinon, and also that there existed remarkable cross resistance between diazinon and fenitrothion in this mosquito.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effect of dichlorvos vapour against Musca domestica vicina Macquart. Culex pipiens pallens and Blattella germanica (L.). The effectiveness at 90% mortality could be equated to concentration (c) in air and exposure time (t) in the following equation, c^n・t=K. The empirical equations against applied insects are shown in Table 1. The relation between the aged days (t′) after openning the seal of container of dichlorvos resin dispenser (Vapona resin strip) and dose (d) of released dichlorvos vapour could be expressed in the following equation : d^<1.531>・t′=977.24. The residual effect of a 25cm long dichlorvos resin dispenser against German cockroach adult males in a chamber at mortality of over 90% after exposure for 24 hours continued to the 60th day in 5m^3 and to the 20th day in 10m^3.

N2  - The segregation of the siphonal hair types in the 4-4 true bred population of the autogenous strain is observed from F_1 through F_10. It seems that a pure strain concerned with the siphonal hair type cannot be obtained even though the selection is continued further. The maximum frequency of type 4-4 in the type 4-4 true bred population is estimated as about 80%, if a sufficient number of egg rafts are observed. These values seem to be same as or similar to those obtained with Culex pipiens pallens. In many cases in the progeny populations, the frequency of type 5-4 is higher than that of type 4-3.

N2  - The genetics of dieldrin-resistance in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, were studied by exposing a batch of larvae (from a single female) to dieldrin and observing percentage knockdown at various intervals. Hybrids of Denken (susceptible) and Isago (resistant) colonies were intermediate in resistance as compared to both parents. In the progeny of F_2 (by mass mating) the segregation into three types, i. e. resistant, intermediate and susceptible individuals, occured in the ration 1 : 2 : 1. In the progeny of back-crosses with F_1 (hybrids) and P (susceptible or resistant), the ratio of susceptible and resistant individuals was 1 : 1. It is therefore concluded that dieldrin-resistance in the German cockroach is mono-factorial with partial dominance. The separation and establishment of pure dieldrin-resistant and -susceptible colonies from a mixed Kanda colony was successfully achieved by making use of discriminating dosages.

N2  - In May 1952 a black-coloured cockroach closely allied to Periplaneta fuliginosa was captured at Cape Sata, the southernmost point of Kyushu. Fortunately this female insect produced a number of progenies including both sexes. During subsequent years more specimens were secured from various small islands belonging to Kagoshima Prefecture, the Ryukyus, and Hachijo Island of the Izu-group. As the cockroach proved finally to be an undescribed species a description is given in this paper. Grateful thanks should be presented, in this occasion, to my colleagues who generously offered me additional material for this study.

N2  - Some white-eyed larvae of Culex pipiens molestus were isolated in September, 1968, from the DDT-resistant colony which had been collected at Kawasaki, Japan in 1962. In order to find the values of crossover between the sex factor (M, m) and the white eye gene both in the white eye colony from Kawasaki (wj) and in another white eye colony (w) from Dr. A. R. Barr's laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles, U. S. A., the male mosquitoes heterozygous for the white eye gene were backcrossed with the white-eyed female mosquitoes. The crossover values for the white eye gene and the sex factor ranged between 0.32% (in 3 to 5 day-old males) and 0.7% (in 8 to 10 day-old males) in the wj colony and between 0.16% (in 3 to 5 day-old males) and 0.34% (in 8 to 10 day-old males) in the w colony, indicating that both the white eye genes are located at the same crossover distance from the sex factor and the crossover value for the sex factor and the white eye gene was insignificantly higher in the older male mosquitoes of both the white eye colonies.

N2  - For the purpose of estimating the elapsed time after blood sucking, saline extracts of mosquitoes were prepared serially following a blood meal, and were examined spectrophotometrically at optical densities of 280mμ (protein band) and 410mμ (Soret band). The value of the OD 410mμ readings fell rapidly while those at an OD 280mμ fell gradually. The value of log OD 410mμ/OD 280mμ (Y) was found to be a parameter of the elapsed time. In two experiments with mouse blood in Aedes aegypti at 25℃. the values obtained from the graphed regression line were Y=-0.0134t+0.414 with r=-0.953. and Y=0.0132t+0.422 with r=-0.969 respectively, where Y represents the above mentioned logarithmic value, t the time in hours, and r the correlation coefficient between them. Results obtained with human blood in Aedes aegypti were Y=-0.0106t+0.459, and r=-0.948 and in Culex tritaeniorhynchus were Y=-0.0089t+0.372 with an r value of -0.874. The regression lines obtained varied with the type of ingested blood and with the species of mosquitos tested. Since there were some variations in the logarithmic values obtained from the same mosquitoes at any one time, an exact estimation of the elapsed time after blood sucking could not be calculated for individual mosquitoes. The values of the correlation coefficients were large enough to permit the estimation of the blood sucking activity in a wild population of a certain species of mosquitoes.

N2  - Truck trap collections were made to analyze the mosquito populations in a rural area of Gunma Prefecture during the period from the beginning of May to the beginning of October 1965. The trap was a similar type to that reported by Bidlingmayer (1966) and mounted on the roof of a small vehicle. It had a 110×80cm frontal opening, 175cm length and a 15×15cm rear opening where a nylon net was fixed to collect insect specimens. Operations were made for about 3 hours after sunset along the paths through villages and rice fields on 2 successive evenings in every week. The vehicle was driven at a velocity of 25-30 km/h. Eight species of mosquitoes were collected through the survey and the seasonal abundance of the 4 major species (Aedes vexans, Anopheles sinensis, Culex pipiens and Culex tritaeniorhynchus) were compared as shown in Fig.2. The transitions of physiological age of female mosquitoes were also studied for the 4 species dividing into 3 categories ; empty parous, blooded or gravid, and empty nulliparous. The parity of the mosquitoes were not markedly advanced at the latter part of the survey for all species, but the 3-4 week cyclic fluctuations seemed to be recognized for first 2 months in Aedes vexans and Anopheles sinensis. Culex pipiens had a relatively higher constitution of the blooded-gravid group than that in other species throughout the survey period due to chiefly the predominance of gravid specimens. Anopheles sinensis had, on the contrary, larger number of specimens with sackshaped dilatation at the pedicel of ovarioles among the empty parous group which indicate the immediateness after the oviposition. These findings may give some clew to our knowledge on the flight activity of the mosquitoes in regard to the oviposition behavior.

N2  - As a part of a series of studies on ecology of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus, the principal vector of Japanese encephalitis, observations were made in the summer of 1967 and 1968 in Okayama Prefecture on the resting behavior of the females before and after taking blood from pig or man. Two methods were mainly used, collection and counting of the mosquitos trapped on the surface of adhesive fly catcher ribbons, and those on resting temporarily on plane paper tapes or on walls. The ribbons and tapes were set at distances of 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m, 16m and 32m from the pig. The females were found to make frequent stops on various surface near host both before and after taking blood meal, and the numbers of unengorged mosquitos according to the hours showed rather flat distributions with the peak during early hour of night, while those of engorged mosquitos showed rather sharply pointed curve with the peak at about 3 a.m., as shown in Figs 1 and 2. Since the count on the adhesive tapes represented the cumulative number of the mosquitos stopped on the surface during certain period of time (one hour in these experiments), its ratio to the counts on non-adhesive tapes was considered as an indicator of the average resting time of the mosquitos during the hour. As the average of all night, the resting time of unengorged females was estimated to be 13 minutes, while those engorged was 34 minutes in C. t. summorosus, (In Anopheles sinensis, the figures were longer in general, 38 and 68 minutes respectively). The resting time varied according to the hour, and was estimated to be the longest at around midnight in the unengorged, and at 1-3 a.m. in the engorged mosquitos. The results roughly coincided with those obtained from direct observations of mosquitos resting on the wall of a pigsty. In the comparative study on the relationships between mosquito counts on the ribbons or tapes set at various distances from the blood source, it was demonstrated that the unengorged females were more concentrated to sites closer to the host, while the highest density of those after engorged was on the surface at about 2-4 meters distant from the blood source.

N2  - A series of studies on the seasonal prevalence of Japanese encephalitis virus in relation to the most important vector mosquito, Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus, have been conducted since 1965. Five pigpens, two cowhouses and the Toyama Airport, located near the paddy field zone in Toyama Prefecture, have been selected as experimental sites. The results and conclusion are summarized as follows : The prevailing season for the vector mosquito population was, in general, from late July to late August. Numbers of mosquitoes, however, have decreased with the increase of early rice crop in recent years. This pattern seemed to have been affected by helicopter-spraying of the insecticides against rice insects. In 1968, for instance, a spray test with 1.5% carbaryl (0.3kg/acre) at the beginning of August resulted in keeping the vector mosquito population under control, although the mosquitoes still became infected with the virus from the 5th to 26th of August and the virus isolation rate was still high. That is, the vector mosquito population was so small and so was that of infected mosquitoes in 1968. This may explain that the population of swine infected with the virus never reached to 100% and that there was no virologically or serologically diagnosed human Japanese encephalitis cases in Toyama Prefecture in 1968. No attempt has been made in this country to control the adult mosquitoes in paddy fields. It is conceivable, however, that an extensive aerial application of insecticides such as carbaryl over the dry paddy fields for early rice crop, ordinarily seen in Toyama Prefecture, at the time when mosquitoes become infected with the virus, results in much reduction of the vector mosquito population and Japanese encephalitis virus.

N2  - 1) Studies were carried out on (1) the effects of two new organo-phosphorus insecticides, Abate and Dursban, on larvae and adults mosquitos, (2) their cross-resistance or -tolerance to the other chemicals, and (3) their toxicity to the guppy, Lebistes reticulatus and the top-minnow, Gambusia affinis. 2) The toxicity of Abate to the larvae of C. p. fatigans, C. p. molestus and C. tritaeniorhynchus was on the same level as fenthion or higher than the chemical. Dursban on the same species were several times as toxic as Abate to the above species. The effects of these two chemicals on Aedes aegypti were inferior to those on culicine larvae. It is suspected that the colony of A. aegypti used in the present study was more or less resistant to these chemicals. 3) Diazinon-, fenitrothion-, malathion-, and DDT-selected strains of the C. pipiens group showed no cross-resistance to Abate nor to Dursban. 4) The LC-50 value for Abate in tap water with free chlorine was estimated to be several times as high as in deionized water. It seems that Abate has been decomposed by free chlorine into less toxic compounds. 5) The insecticidal effect of Dursban on both larvae and adults of the mosquitos was the most rapid of five OP compounds tested. When adult mosquitos were brought into contact to the residue of Abate, only 2 individuals out of 40 could be knocked down after continuous contact for 24 hours. 6) The LD-50 volues determined by topical application tests with the C. pipiens group were 0.025〜0.027μg/mosquito for Abate, having almost the same toxicity as diazinon and malathion, and 0.0034〜0.0050μg for Dursban, which is several times as effective as Abate and yet less effective than fenthion and fenitrothion. 7) The LC-50 values for Dursban were 0.2 ppm in toe top-minnow, (Gambsia affinis), and 0.06 ppm in the guppy (Lebistes reticulatus), being fairly toxic to the fish. The LC-50 values for Abate was 15 ppm in the top-minnow and 5 ppm in the guppy, and was less toxic than Dursban.

N2  - In 1968 and 1969, laboratory studies were conducted with German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), to determine their susceptibility level to lindane, diazinon, fenitrothion and fenthion. Cockroaches collected from 13 localities in Kyushu, Japan, i. e. Nakazu, Tenjin, Ohhashi, Hakata A, Hakata B, Nakatsu, Nobeoka, Miyazaki, Abutatsu, Kagoshima, Ibusuki, Saga and Isahaya, were compared with a susceptible laboratory colony for determining their resistance level by knockdown tests. The configuration ratio of three phenotypes in lindane resistance, i. e. homozygous susceptibles (SS), heterozygous hybrids (RS) and homozygous resistants (RR), was detected from the plateaux demonstrated on a log time-probit percentage knockdown line. Susceptibility to three organophosphorus insecticides was also assessed by knockdown time and mortality after contact to the residues. All the populations tested have shown high resistance to lindane, and they were proved to be almost susceptible to diazinon, fenitrothion and fenthion, though a few individuals in Nakazu and Aburatsu populations were suspected to be more or less resistant.

N2  - In the course of field studies on epidemiology of japanese encephalitis in Okayama Prefecture, two dry ice traps using mosquito net were used at about weekly intervals in the purpose of collecting nocturnally active mosquitos, during the periods from May 22 to October 16, 1967, and from May 24 to September 11, 1968. The traps were operated for two and half hours from 30 minutes before the sunset, and the mosquitos attracted to the carbon dioxide source were allowed to enter into the mosquito nets. Besides large numbers of mosquitos (altogether 9 species) reported in separate papers, the following 13 species (64 specimens) of tabanid flies were also trapped. The above results are interesting in that the tabanid flies, including rather rare species, are collectable during the night time with the simple dry ice mosquito traps, though they have been known to be attracted to carbon dioxide during the daytime. 1) Chrysops vanderwulpi, 19 specimens, 2) Atylotus horvathi, 23 specimens, 3) Tabanus exoticus, 1 specimen, 4) T. trigonus 3 specimens, 5) T. shikokuensis, 4 specimens, 6) T. coquilletti, 5 specimens, 7) T. administrans, 1 specimen, 8) T. fuluimedioides, 2 specimens, 9) T. iyoensis, 1 specimen, 10) T. amaenus, 1 specimen, 11) T. takasagoensis, 1 specimen, 12) Tabanus sp.

N2  - Several strains of house flies were tested in a box (0.5m^3) to evaluate the relative effectiveness of three pyrethroids. The following strains were used as test insects. 1. Tatara (Highly r-BHC-and dieldrin-resistant) 2. Takatsuki (susceptible) 3. Lab-em-7-em (susceptible) 4. 213-ab (D D T-and pyrethrins-resistant) 5. RP (diazinon-resistant) 6. P-9 (diazinon-resistant) 7. Py (pyrethrins-resistant) 8. CSMA (susceptible) The order of resistance levels based on the KT-50 valus for three pyrethroids were as follows. Pyrethrins : Py>RP>P-9>Lab-em-7-em>213-ab>Takatsuki>CSMA>Tatara. Allethrin : 213-ab>Takatsuki>Py>CSMA>RP>Lab-em-7-em>P-9>Tatara. Phthalthrin : Takatsuki>213-ab>RP>Lab-em-7-em>Py>CSMA>P-9>Tatara. The quantites of allethrin penetration through the cuticlar layer of the house fly were determined by means of Gas-chromatrography.

N2  - The cross-section of the malpighian tubules often shows 2 or 3 relatively large epithelial cells, resting on a thin basement membrane. Basal, intermediate and apical zones of each cell exhibit a characteristic structural appearance. The basal zone, where many mitochondria and vacuoles are located, is characterized by infoldings of the cell membrane, namely, a basal striation. The intermediate zone contains a number of vacuoles of varying sizes, and lime granules are 0.1 to 3 microns in diameter. Each of these granules is constructed of 2 to 7 layers. In addition, many mitochondria and coarse endoplasmic reticulum are seen near the apical zone. Clods of electron-dense granules, about 400Å in diameter, are scattered in the basal and intermediate zones. In the apical zone which forms the brush border, a multitude of vertically arranged protoplasmic processes are seen. Each process contains a mitochondrion whose cristae run mostly parallel to the process.

N2  - The observations were made on the bionomics of larvae and on the blood-sucking behaviour of adults of the deerfly, Chrysops suavis Loew, in Kozu pasture in Gunma Prefecture. Most of the larvae of Chrysops suavis were found in 5cm depth from the sandy soil surface in an artifitial pond and usually 40cm apart from the edge of the waterbody. No larva found in swamps or streams in the pasture. Its pupal period on an average, was 10.13±2.76 days. It took roughly 1 to 2 minutes for the molting of pupae. The emargence took place during 9 to 11 a.m. and 3 to 5 p.m. in many cases. The diurnal rhythm of blood-sucking activity of Chrysops suavis apparently had two distinct peaks, one in the morning and the other in late afternoon, as shown by the number of flies on cattle hosts. The adults of Chrysops suavis attack mainly on the scrota of the ox and the horse. The adults attack neither on the back nor the side of the animals.

N2  - Observations were made on the horse fly, Tabanus iyoensis Shiraki, at Nakanokouchi, Toyama Prefecture, in early fall of 1968, using the collection methods with dry ice light traps and insect nets. The results were as follows : 1. Carbon dioxide gas was found to have a remarkable attracting effect on the female horsefly and large numbers of them could be collected in the dry ice traps shown in Fig. 3. Remarkable increases were seen in the number collected in the trap with dry ice during the daytime from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. in comparison with the control trap without dry ice. 2. No consistent differences were seen between the numbers collected in the traps covered with black or white sheets. 3. The horse fly was observed to be attracted to electric light (fluorescent lamp, green and blue light) in the evening. 4. Their flight activity was found to be enhanced by the movement of a vehicle, and by waving of insect nets. Large numbers of the horse-fly could be collected with the insect net particularly in early morning and at dusk. 5. Preliminary studies on the population density and the flight range of this species of horse-flies were conducted by the mark and release method, in which about 1 and 5 percent of the population were recaptured with the dry ice traps and the insect nets at the two trials. 6. The flight and the biting activity of the horse-fly were observed in the temperature range of 20°to 26℃ and during the daytime under illumination of 10 to 1, 000 lux, but not at temperatures below 15℃ nor in complete darkness. In this connection, their activity was found to be the highest in the morning and at dusk in midsummer, and at the daytime in the autumn season.

N2  - Field observations were made during the summer seasons of 1967 and 1968 in a swamp area of Okayama Prefecture on the biting activity of the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus, the principal vector of Japanese encephalitis. The nocturnal rhythm of its biting activity was estimated by various methods, such as the counts at half an hour's intervals on pigs, on human baits, and those on plates or tapes set near dry ice baits. Large numbers of the mosquito were found to be attracted to pigs in this area, and the total number of the mosquitoes that engorged from a pig per night was estimated to exceed 50, 000 in the middle of July at its peak of seasonal activity. The nocturnal biting rhythm of the mosquito as seen from the counts on a pig or human body was almost constant throughout the night, usually with two inconspicuous peaks, one at about 9 p.m. and the other at about 2 : 30 a.m. Such a pattern seen with C. t. summorosus was similar to that observed with Anopheles sinensis under the same condition, but was quite different from that of Culex pipiens pallens (one peak at about midnight) or of Armigeres subalbatus (two peaks, at about sunset and sunrise time). C. t. summorosus was found to attack all body parts of the pig almost evenly, while A. sinensis was seen to attack predominantly on the bellylegs and head, and only rarely on the back and sides of the pig. The same group of mosquitoes were attracted to dry ice placed on the ground surface, and their nocturnal rhythm could be observed also by counting the numbers resting temporally on plates set near the carbondioxide source, or those trapped on adhesive fly paper. In these observations activity of the female C. t. summorosus was seen to have two peaks also during the hours from 8 to 9 p.m. and from 2 to 3 a.m., which were more sharply defined than observed from the direct counts on animal baits. The numbers of mosquitos recorded on the plates or tapes decreased in relation to the distance from the carbon dioxide source, roughly with an inverse proportion.

N2  - 1. A seasonal study was carried out on the mosquito population breeding in rock pools in the river bed of Nagatoro, Saitama Prefecture, during the period from January 1966 to February 1968, with emphasis on the bionomics of the little known mosquito species Aedes hatorii Yamada, 1921. 2. As the results of 50 times of collections made during the period, a total of 53, 148 larvae belonging to 10 species in 3 genera were identified. Among them, Aedes hatorii was the predominant and constituted 84.7% of the larvae and pupae collected, while Aedes japonicus was the next common species with 9.7% of the total collections. 3. The population density of Aedes hatorii was the highest during the summer season from July to September, while Aedes japonicus was almost absent in the summer and was found to be breeding most abundantly in early spring. 4. The two species were shown to survive the winter in egg and or mature larval stages. 5. The principal breeding places of Aedes japonicus were rock pools in shade, while Aedes hatorii was found almost in every pool including those in open areas.

N2  - A series of experiments were carried out on the effects of some insecticides on the tropical rat mite, Ornithonyssus bacoti, in the laboratory for the screening tests of antifilarial drugs using the cotton rat filaria, Litomosoides carinii. For this purpose, it is necessary to breed large numbers of the mite in the laboratory to serve them as the intermediate host, but on the other hand, it is also important to get rid of the mite from the animal room to avoid spontaneous infection of the animals. As preliminary experiments to find out the effects of insecticides under simulated conditions, cotton, wirescreen and the cotton rat's body surface were treated with 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and 0.003 percent emulsion in water of the five insecticides, malathion, fenitrothion (Sumithion), diazinone, dichlorvos (DDVP) and lindane. Certain numbers of the mite were released on these materials treated under various conditions, and the mortality after one to 24 hours were recorded. Among the insecticides thus tested, fenitrothion and diazinone were the most effective, and nearly 100 percent mortality was seen even at the lowest concentration of 0.003 percent, while the other two organophosphorous insecticides, malathion and dichlorvos were effective up to 0.01 or 0.03 percent. No satisfactory effect were seen for lindane even at the highest concentration of 0.3 percent. At applications on the cotton rat's body, some toxic effects were seen in diazinone, dichlorvos and lindane. The residual effects of the insecticides were also tested at various time intervals from applications of 0.03 percent emulsions on various materials. In general, the longest effects were observed for all the insecticides when cotton was used as the substratum, and nearly 100 percent mortality was seen even after 32 days in fenitrothion, malathion and diazinone, while the effects were shorter when the insecticides were applied on wirescreen. The effects of the insecticides applied on the cotton rat's body surface were much shorter, and were found to be lost almost completely after 8 days of the application for all the insecticides. Among the insecticides tested, fenitrothion showed the longest residual effects in all the cases, and malathion was the next in the order. In the practical use of insecticides for the control of the tropical rat mite in animal houses, spray of 0.01 percent emulsion of fenitrothion or malathion on animal cages gave satisfactory results, and no toxic effects were seen in the animals. In general, fenitrothion is considered to be the choice because of its higher effectiveness, longer residual effects and lower toxicity. However, in our special animal rooms in which the rats are used repeatedly as the hosts for the mites, malathion has been used to remove the mites from animal cages for the sake of safety for the following biting experiments, since the compound has shorter residual effects than fenitrothion.

N2  - A series of laboratory tests were carried out to estimate the contact toxicity of some insecticides and acaricides against the tick, Argas japonicus collected from nests of the swallow, Delicnon urbica. The compounds tested were DDT, lindane, dieldrin, DDVP, malathion, fenthion (Baytex), fenitrothion (Sumithion), EPN, Kelthane, Phenkapton and Akar. Emulsions of the compounds were diluted with deionized water to concentration 1.0, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 percent, and were impregnated in filter papers at a rate of 50ml/m^2. Mortality of the ticks was recorded after being exposed to the residual deposits for 48 hours. The comparative toxicity of the compounds tested by this method was by the order of lindane, dieldrin, DDVP, Sumithion=malathion and EPN, and the other compounds were shown to be almost ineffective, as shown in Table 1. Hundred percent mortality was observed with lindane at 0.1 percent and with dieldrin and DDVP at 1.0 percent. At the observations on the knock down percentage of the ticks in relation to the time of exposure to deposits of 1.0 percent emulsions. KT-50 value was by the order of lindane (93 minutes), DDVP (165 minutes) and dieldrin (460 minutes).

N2  - Ces dernieres annees, la generalisation des bombes aerosole insecticides est bien remarquable au point que tous les insecticides pour l'usage domestique adopte le type decrit ci-dessus. Il est donc necessaire de constater une methode simple, rapide et assez precise pour permettre une mesure relative de l'efficacite insecticide des bombes aerosols commerciaux. En generale, la methode de Peet-Grady est, jusqu'a present, utilisee en Europe et en Amerique mais elle ne serait pas toujours la meilleure. Dans ce note, les auteurs rapportent les resultats obtenues apres avoir verifier quelques methodes pour constater une methode valable ci-dessus. Les auteurs ont utilise les trois methodes : celle de Peet-Grady appliquee aux pays europeens et en Amerique; celle de l'appareil du type Boite a 0.5m^3 decrite dans le guide d'Insecticide (1965); enfin celle du type DS prepare par la Station de Phytopharmacie de l'Etat, Gembloux (Belgique). Les bombes utilisees sont les aerosols contenant du Neopynamin a 0.2% en solution dans l'eau et l'huile. L'insecte-teste est effectue chez la mouche domestique (Musca domestica vicina Masque, la souche Takatsuki) eleve de generation en generation au laboratoire et adulte agee de 5 jours apres l'emergence. Les resultats obtenues sont la suivante. 1°Parmis trois methode, il est en evidence que la methode du type DS a la plus grande efficacite pour le teste insecticide. L'appareil au type Boite a 0.5m^3 suit celui du type DS. 2°Au point de vue economique, l'appareil au type Boite a 0.5m^3 est moins couteux que celui a DS. 3°Quant a l'effet de solvant, on a observe la difference entre l'aerosol a l'huile et celui aqueux; l'efficacite de la methode ne subit pas sur sa efficacite. 4°Les auteurs concluent qu'il estev desirable d'utiliser simultanement la methode du type DS et celle du type Boite a 0.5m^3 pour proceder a l'etude de l'amelioration des insecticides.

N2  - The characteristics of spermatozoon of Culex pipiens pallens, have been observed by the electron microscope. The measurment of spermatozoon is approximately 220μin length and 0.6μ in maximum diameter of the whole body. The nucleus which occupies the anterior part of a spermatozoon, is the most electron dense. The nucleus is surrounded by a ring of a row of microtubules whose axis is parallel to the long axis of the cell. The minute plate-shaped head cap located in the anterior end, is about 130Å in thickness and about 0.5μin diameter. The posterior nuclear groove is connected to the axial filament complex which extends to the posterior end of spermatozoon as axis of the tail. The flagella has a 9+1 pattern in the filament of axial filament complex. Finally, the characteristic pattern of these filaments is lost and the filaments disappear at the posterior end of the spermatozoon. The small centriole-like body abuts on the posterior end of the nucleus but in this observation no small body could be identified. Two cords of mitochondria extend along the axial filament complex from the posterior end of the centriole like body towards the posterior end of the spermatozoon.

N2  - An ecological study was made on the larval populations of mosquito overwintering in Kagoshima City, southern Japan. The purpose of this report is to show the mode of overwintering habits of several mosquito species from the view point of seasonal change in population size and larval age structure. 1) Larvae of Uranotaenia bimaculata, Aedes japonicus and Tripteroides bambusa survived winter season, and their population size increased during winter months with appearance of the younger larvae and reached to a maximum in January, February and April, respectively. The older larvae and pupae became dominant in spring months, when a considerable number of pupal exuviae was observed. These facts apparently indicate that eggs of these species hatch in the course of overwintering and that the first adult populations of the next year originate mainly from the newly hatched larvae. 2) Population size of Armigeres subalbatus diminished gradually from December to March. Through these months, only the fourth stage larvae were observed except in March, when a number of pupae appeared. The larval population became extinct in April and a small number of pupal exuviae remained. These indicate that the fourth stage larvae survive the coldest months and pupate in March and that adults emerge in spring months. 3) Population size of Culex pipiens s. l. diminished gradually from December to March. During these months, however, a number of the fourth stage larvae grew to pupae and a few pupal exuviae were observed. Early in April, population size reached to a maximum with appearance of the first stage larvae, which hatched from the egg masses newly laid in March. These indicate that most larvae and pupae become extinct during the coldest months, even if a few of the pupae emerge into adults. So, the first adult population must be originated from the newly hatched larvae. 4) None of Aedes albopictus larvae and pupae was observed in the coldest months. The first population of younger larvae started in March and older larvae became dominant in May, when a considerable number of pupae and pupal exuviae were observed. These show that this species can not survive the coldest months as larvae and that the first adult population originates from the newly hatched larvae.

N2  - From April to October 1967, some ecological surveys and experiments on Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus were carried out with wild-caught mosquitoes, which were collected by light trap method in a pigpen and a neighbouring henhouse in the suburbs of Yokohama. The collections of the mosquitoes have been done successively for the whole night every day. Throughout the experiments, all developmental stages of the mosquitoes have been reared in a room under the conditions of room temperature and natural day length, without any heating or cooling and lighting. The average bloodsucking rates of the female populations were calculated as 59.0% in the pigpen and 22.3% in the henhouse. In the former, however, the rate in July was below average (45.7%) owing probably to the whole sprayings in the pigpen. In rearing cages, the ovipositing activities of engorged females collected every month in the pigpen could be seen successively from the end of May to September and, in September, the ovipositing rate was higher than that in the preceding months, being more than 50%, especially 70% in early September. No females laid eggs in April and October. The average egg number of about 300 rafts which were laid during the period from June to October was checked. In June, 227.5 eggs per raft was counted and this was the highest throughout the seasons. From this month, a gradual reduction in the number of eggs was noted during the following four months, namely 195.7, 185.5, 177.3 and 148.6 eggs per raft respectively. The hatcheabilities of these egg batches were comparatively uniform, 95.1% in the average rate. The parous rate of the female population in the pigpen was almost similar to that in the last year, 1966. The rate was the lowest in May and it increased gradualy toward the end of the season and, in October, the population consisted mainly of parous females, being the rate 89%. This shows that there was a just reverse relationship between the parous rate and the average egg number in seasonal prevalences. A dissociation of ovarian development of F_1 females developed from the engorged wild mosquitoes which were collected in the pigpen were observed after a feeding on mice from June to October. The first gonotrophic dissociation was recognized in some individuals (11.8%) emerged at the beginning of August when the threshold of day length was about 14 hrs. Since the mid-September, when the length of day was 12 : 30-12 : 20 hrs, those individuals rapidly increased, more than 80% in the rate of gonotrophic dissociation. However, when the mosquitoes have just started larval developments, the thresholds of photoperiod should be larger than those given above. According to these results, it was quite probable that the hibernating adult population involves the following two groups of mosquitoes : 1) some individuals of gonoactive generation developing during the period from September to October, 2) all individuals of gonoinactive generation derived from the former during the same periods. The latter should be the main hibernating mosquitoes in general.

N2  - The ecological studies of vector mosquitoes of Japanese encephalitis virus were carried out in the suburbs of Izumi City, Osaka Prefecture, since 1963. Mosquitoes were collected by nets and sucking-tubes at a cow-shed and by dryice baited traps in paddy fields. 1. The most abundant species was Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which was over 90% of all collected. There was no significant difference in species composition between mosquitoes collected at the cow-shed and those in the paddy fields. 2. Major occuring season of the Culex tritaeniorhynchus is in July and August by counting the number of mosquitoes collected by the light trap of New Jersey type, but peak of emergence of this species varied both from place to place and from year to year at the cow-shed during three years (Fig.3). 3. Observations of the mosquitoes breeding in the paddy fields were made in 1965. Culex tritaeniorhynchus was the dominant species, and a few other species were also found ; Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis (3.4%), Culex pipiens pallens (2.3%) and Culex vishnui (0.09%). Seasonal prevalence of immature mosquitoes is shown in Fig. 7. Culex tritaeniorhynchus appeared in the beginning of July, reached the peak in the middle of the same month, and disappeared in the end of August. 4. Blood-sucking rate of C. tritaeniorhynchus collected inside the cow-shed was examined. The seasonal change in the blood-sucking rate of this species is shown in Table 3. The rates were 74 to 97% during the period from the middle of July to the beginning of August. Although the rate decreased slightly in the middle of August, it was kept on the level of about 50% until the end of September. Mosquitoes collected in April were presumed to belong to a overwintered population, and the blood-sucking rate of this population was shown to be about 50 per cent. Later, the newly emerged mosquitoes began to appear in the middle of May, and the rate became low suddenly. 5. Observations of the swarming of Culex tritaeniorhynchus were made near the cow-shed in 1965. The swarming was formed usually at a height of 3 to 5 meters. The seasonal change in the sex composition of the swarms of Culex tritaeniorhynchus is shown in Table 4. The percentage of males to the total number was in the range of 24 to 59 from the end of July to the middle of August, and thereafter, the male rate became higher. In the end of September, in spite of the absence of females, the males still continued to swarm. 6. Physiological age was determined for each lot of specimens according to Detinova's method. The species collected at the cow-shed were compared with those collected by the dry ice-baited trap in the paddy field. The parous rate of mosquito population collected inside the cow-shed was higher than in the paddy fields. And also, the rate of mosquito population collected inside the cow-shed was higher than that collected outside. The parous rates of the fed and unfed females collected inside the cow-shed showed no difference. 7. Seasonal changes in the age composition of the mosquito population were observed. Considering the seasonal changes in the parous rates, it was suggested that the adults appeared at first at the middle of May, and that the adults of the last generation appeared at the beginning of September. 8. Virus isolation from the females of Culex tritaeniorhynchus was carried out during 1963 to 1966. As shown in Table 6, the isolation rate of mosquitoes collected in the cow-shed was higher than that in the paddy field. The time of appearance of the infected mosquitoes varied from year to year. Since the size of the human epidemics may depend largely on the population density of the infected mosquitoes, the density of mosquito population during the period of the virus-amplifying cycles was suggested to be a critical factor for the epidemic size.

N2  - Larvae of a sarcophagid fly Parasarcophaga harpax (Pandelle, 1896) were collected from a one day old new-born female in Tokyo, causing otomyiasis. This is a new report of otomyiasis in Japan since 1945, and the first report of the disease caused by this species of the fly. Of three larvae collected from the patient and kept in saline, one was mounted on a slide and two were cultured in horse meat. One male and one female adult flies emerged and both were identified as the above species. The patient was born in a women's hospital on 25 June, 1968, and her mother recognized three larvae coming out of her year in the next morning. At the examination by a phisician in the same afternoon, three more larvae were found in the outer auditory canal, and two other larvae were seen in the tympanic cavity through a hole on the tympanic membrane. Detailed descriptions and discussions were made on the clinical signs observed, and the taxonomic status of the specimmens of the fly obtained from the patient. This case is noteworthy in that she was only one-day old newborn, and that the species of the fly was new as a cause of myiasis.

N2  - The repellency fo the commercial pyroligneous liquors was observed against the flies gathered on meat and the slugs. Also the toxicity of commercial pyroligneous liquors was examined against the slugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. (1) Flies averted odours of neutral, basic and phenolic fractions of the pyroligneous liquor set aside fish meat. The repellency of mixture of these three fractions is more effective than each single fraction. The sun-drying fish treated with the above mixture is tested the repellency to flies. (2) The pyroligneous liquors and the liquors adjusted pH with alkaline showed both marked toxicity on the Japanese native slug, Incilaria confusa Cockerell in contact tests. Organic acid and carbonyl fractions of the above liquors showed more effective to kill slug than basic, neutral and phenolic fractions. (3) Slugs averted odours of the pyroligneous liquor.

N2  - As reported in a previous paper (1965), growth of the housefly larvae (Musca domestica vicina) seems to be greatly affected by pH value of rearing media. To clarify the relationship between pH value of the medium and growth of the housefly larvae, a series of experiments, in which egg, 1st, 2nd and 3rd instar larvae were transplanted and reared in the media of various pH, was carried out. PH value of the medium was adjusted by addition of hydrochloric acid, oxalic acid, caustic soda and ammonia water to basic medium (moistened "Dry mixed food for rat and mouse"). The oviposition rates on hydrochloric acid media were also observed. The results are summarized as follows : 1) In the media of which pH value was 5 to 10, the larvae grew normally, giving high emergence rates. In the pH value of less than 5 or more than 10, larval growth was remarkably disturbed, particularly in acidic side. 2) Emergence rate of the housefly on the hydrochloric acid medium varied with developmental stages of the inoculated larvae. The last instar larvae were more resistant to the acidic media, but about 50% of these larvae could become to adult without any food. 3) It was observed that the houseflies undout-edly refused laying eggs on highly acidic media.

N2  - Since Baker and Wharton (1952) regarded the genus Mealia Trouessart, 1897, as a synonym of the genus Dermatophagoides Bogdanoff, 1864, many authors (Sasa, Dubinin, Baker et al., Hughes, Fain and others) have adopted the genus Dermatophagoides for the free-living mites which abound in the house-dust and other sources. When Fain (1966) redescribed Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Trt.) which was a dominant species in the house-dust, he suggested that it was impossible to define with certainty that D. pteronyssinus (Trt.) is not a synonym of D. schermetewskyi Bogdanoff, 1864. He did not, however, regard the former as a synonym of the latter, and stated that "Nous proposons donc de maintenir les deux especes et d'attendre que la decourverts de nouveau materiel puisse nous fixer sur le statut de D. scheremetewskyi". When he completed a monograph (1967a) on the genus Dermatophagoides, he could not include the redescription of the type species of the genus, i. e., D. scheremetewskyi. This means that the genus Dermatophagoides was reestablished without defining type species. That the dominant form found in the housedust is identical with Trouessart's Mealia pteronyssina seems highly probable on the following grounds : 1) Dr. Fain ascertained that his materials (D. pteronyssinus) was identical with the type series of M. pteronyssinus which was actually preserved in Berlese Collection of Florence with data written by Trouessart (1901) "Habitat : Sur des peaux de Mammiferes preparees et attaquees par des Insectes rongeurs (par M. Petit aine, de Paris", 2) we ascertained the identity between our materials from the house-dust and D. ptronyssinus sensu Fain, and found that our material falls within the category of the genus Mealia Trt., and specifically coincide with M. pteronyssina Trt. according to the original description. In Bogdanoff's original description of D. scheremetewskyi, we found that D. scheremetewskyi is definitely distinguishable morphologically from the species of the genus Mealia Trt. In the female of Bogdanoff's D. scheremetewskyi, 1) palpal tarsus is rather slender and pointed forwards, 2) a pair of external vertical setae are present and are provided with some ten pectinations, 3) a pair of pores which may be traces of internal vertical setae (which must have fallen off) are present, but are drawn by mistake between epimera I and II of ventral view (1B), 4) the propodosmal shield is lacking but that part is carefully and finely striated, 5) both posterior ends of epigynium (lesextremites de l'arc superieur) turned slightly outwards and reached the same level of the scapula of trochanter III, 6) the posterior ends of lateral vulva (les extremites posterieures de ce second arc) reached the same level of the scapula of trochanter IV. In the female of Mealia pteronyssina Trt., 1) palpal tarsus is rather short and turned strongly inwards, 2) both external and internal vertical setae absent, 3) a distinct propodosomal shield is present, 4) the epigynium is likely crescent or house-shoe shaped and the posterior ends do not reach the level of the scapula of trochanter III but may or may not reach the level of the anterior ends of epimera III, 5) the posterior ends of lateral vulva exceed beyond the level of the scapula of trochanter IV. Thus, it is clear that Bogdanoff's genus Dermatophagoides differs from the genus Mealia Trt. We propose, therefore, that the genus Mealia Trt. should be revived for the forms of free-living mites in the house-dust instead of the genus Dermatophagoides, which should be maintained for the true exoparasitic forms as like as the original habitat. It was also emphasized in the present paper that the male mite (described in the Bogdanoff's paper at the same time with the female of D. scheremetewskyi) is not concerned in the problem of the identity of D. scheremetewskyi Bogd., because he only stated that "Peut etre est-ce un jeune male de Dermatophagoides." and has given for the explanation of the figure of the male mite "Acarus de l'Herpes farinosus (male du Dermatophagoides?). On the date of publication of Viscroptes saitoi Sasa, [=M. pteronyssina Trt.], we found also that 1947 should be used instead of 1948 adopted mistakenly widely. We ascertained that the mites collected from the house dust in many places of Japan could not be separated from D. passericola Fain, 1964 [=Mealia passericola (Fain, 1964)], which had been collected originally from the nest of spallow Passer domesticus. Fain (1967a) regarded it to be a synonym of Dermatophagoides chelidonis (Hull, 1931)[=Hirstia chelidonia Hull, 1931] which had been found orignally in the nest of House Martin, Delichon urbica. It is apparent, however, that, according to the original description, the two species definitly distinguish from each on the following grounds : In the genus Hirstia Hull, the female is without a epigynium (chitinous areas in front of the genital openings) and the male with two subapical spur on tarsus IV (this suggests it seems to be related to the genus Euroglyphus Fain, 1965). In the genus Mealia Trt. the female is provided with a epigynium and the male with the modified, small fan-like setae (=ventouses, in Fain) on tarsus IV. In both sexes of H. chelidonis Hull, "the anterior part (=propodosoma) bears a rod-like process which projects forwards and downwards over the rostrum" (this looks like a tegmen of the genus Euroglyphus), "tarsus I and II have a short acute spine just below the apex on the ventral side" (=blunt process), and there are the usual tactile setae (=solenidions) on all the tarsi and tibiae I and II. Tibia I, genu I in the male and tibia II in the female have a apophysis, and tarsus IV in the male have a small tubercular spine near the apex and a little before two other spines. While, in the both sexes of M. passericola (Fain), the tegmen is absent but the anterior margin of propodosoma is straight, without blunt process on both tarsi I and II, and the solenidiotaxy of legs is : Tarsus 2-1-0-0; Tibia 1-1-1-1; Genu 2-1-1-0. On the legs of both sexes without above-mentioned apophysis and in the male above-stated tubercular spine near the apex of tarsus IV. Therefore it is apparent that the genus Histia Hull should be separated from the genus Mealia Trt., the former may be related to the genus Euroglyphus Fain. For the second species of the genus Mealia Trt. found from the house-dust in Japan Mealia passericola (Fain, 1964) should be adopted in stead of Dermatophagoides chelidonis (Hull, 1931).

N2  - Two myobiid mite species, Protomyobia brevisetosa Jameson, 1948 (known from U. S. A.) and Amorphacarus elongatus (Poppe, 1896) (known from Europe), were reported from shrews (Sorexunguiculatus, Sorex caecutiens saevus) of Hokkaido, Japan. Both of these mites showed minor host specificity and are often found together on a same shrew. Hokkaido specimens of A. elongatus differ slightly from the descriptions of A. elongatus by Poppe (1896) and by Radford (1948), but more specimens are needed before we can confirm the difierences between Hokkaido population of A. elongatus and those of Europe.

N2  - The difference of larval period between the male and the female was observed on Culex pipiens pallens. In both sexes, period of 2nd instar larva was the shortest, 1st, 3rd instar larval and pupal stage came next and 4th instar was the longest. No differences were observed between the male and the female in the length of periods of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd instar larval and the pupal stages, but that of the 4th instar of females was longer than that of males. Generally speaking, the male emerges 1-2 days earlier than the female, and this phenomenon seemed to depend on mainly the difference in the length of 4th instar larva.

N2  - Following the studies reported in the previous paper on the relationship between hypopus production and the environmental factors in grain mites, a series of experiments were carried out to observe the reproductivity and the stage composition of a a population of Lardoglyphus konoi (Sasa et Asanuma, 1951) when exposed to conditions of different relative humidities. The material used in the present experiment was a colony of L. konoi in a diet composed of a mixture of dried yeast and fishmeal powder at the ratio of 4 : 6, for 4 weeks at the temperature of 25℃ and the relative humidity of 75%. The material contained an average mite count of 256 per 0.5g at start of the experiment. Each 10g of the mite containing diet was divided into small glass vials and were placed in glass dessicators containing saturated solutions in water of various salts giving different relative humidities, such as 98% with K_2SO_4, 94% with KNO_3, 87% with KCl, 82% with Na_2SO_4, 76% with NaCl, 66% with NaNO_2, and 51% with NaHSO_4・H_2O. All the containers were kept at 25℃. 1. The population density and the stage composition of mites in the diet. The trend of increase in the density of mites were seen at relative humidities above 75%, with the maximum of 912 per 0.5g at 82% after 7 days, while the population density was found to decrease gradually at lower humidities of 66% and 52% from as early as 2 days after the exposure. As for the stage composition of the populations, reduction in the ratios of adults as well as increases in those of protonymphs was seen from after 2 days at lower humidities, while the composition remained almost unchanged for about 2 weeks at the higher humidity conditions and the ratio of adults began to increase from after 17 days. The appearance of the hypopus was observed from about 10 days at all humidities, and its highest ratio was seen at the optimum reproductive condition of 82%, forming a peak in the range from 87% to 76%. 2. The numbers and the stage composition of the escaped mites. The containers of the mites were placed each on petri dish containing saturated solutions of the respective salts, and the numbers as well as the stage composition of mites escaped from the diet and water surface were examined everyday. Large numbers of the mites were found to escape from the containers at lower humidities seen after start of the experiment, while the beginning of such migration was delayed for one to two days in containers exposed to humidities higher than 94%. In all the cases, the peak of the numbers of escaped mites was seen during the period when the population density of the mites in the diet began to decrease. The ratios of the numbers of escaped mites to the density in the original diet were the lowest in the optimum reproductive conditions of 82%, 94% and 98%, and the highest at the lowest relative humidity conditions. In the initial stage of the mite culture, most of the escaped mites were the adults, but mites of younger stages were found also to migrate in later stages, and the ratios of the latter stages gradually increased along with the increase in the population density in the original diet. The appearance of the hypopus among the escaped mites was seen from about the 8th day in most cultures, but was delayed for a few days at the highest humidities. It was also observed that the period in days required for the ratio of the hypopus reaching to above 10% became longer at the humidity increased, and the highest hypopus ratios were seen at 76 and 87% R. H., same as that observed with the populations in the diet.

N2  - The duration of egg-larval and pupal stages, percent pupation, percent emergence, sex ratio and body weight of pupae in resistant and susceptible strains of the house fly were compared. Three strains of house flies are as follows; Musca domestica domestica CSMA : Susceptible strain; 213-ab : DDT, Pyrethrins-Resistant strain Musca domestica vicina Takatsuki : No insecticidal pressure in the laboratory LD_<50> values by the topical application method are shown in table 1. The duration of egg-larval stage of Takatsuki strain was found to be significantly longer than those of CSMA and 213-ab strains. Also, pupal body weight of Takatsuki strain was observed to be significantly heavier than CSMA and 213-ab strains.

N2  - Survey of insecticide resistance in Blattella germanica was carried out with the insects collected from 16 localities in Kawasaki City, Japan, in the period from September 1966 to August 1967. The configuration ratio of three phenotypes, i. e. SS, RS, RR, was evaluated by the lt-p lines after contact to dieldrin residue. All the populations collected from restaurants, bars, etc. showed high resistance to dieldrin. One population from a pig pen, however, was estimated to be nearly susceptible to dieldrin. As the results of preliminary tests on diazinon resistance, all the populations were proved to be susceptible to the chemical.

N2  - Observations were made on the oviposition and hatching of the deer fly, Chrysops suavis Loew, at Kozu pasture in Gunma Prefecture during the period from the spring of 1965 to the autumn of 1966. The eggs were found to be deposited in masses mostly on several species of plants growing near artificial ponds, usually within 40cm from the edge of the water. The oviposition was never seen in swamps or along streams in the pasture. The females at the oviposition rested on the weeds or other objects with the head directed downwards, and deposited eggs in clusters on the surface. Two egg culsters examined by the author were composed of 495 and 492 eggs in three layers. Among 65 egg clusters examined on 17 July, 1965, 64 were found on the surface of plants (59 on leaves and 5 on stalks) and one on the surface of a timber. All of them were deposited on the shaded side such as the back surface of leaves, with the exception of a single egg mass found on the sunny side of a stalk. In all of the three cases observed by the author, the oviposition took place in late afternoon during 4 to 5 p.m. It took roughly 2 hours for the females to deposite about 500 eggs. Two egg rafts brought into the laboratory for further observations in July and August hatched both after 7 days. The hatching of eggs took place almost simultaneously within several minutes when the petri dish was slightly moved giving a stimulate to the eggs. The larvae escaped from the egg shell were floating on the surface of water for a while and then sunk to the bottom, and immediately made a start of the cannibalism. The hatching rates of the two egg masses were 98 and 92 percent.

N2  - Investigations on the mosquito fauna and their seasonal prevalence in Saitama Prefecture were made by setting light traps for a period from May to November 1966, at about weekly intervals, at four stations in Omiya. Tokorozawa. Gyoda and Nogami, representing either the urban or the rural areas. A total of 4 genera, 10 species and 2, 793 specimens of mosquitos were collected. Culex pipiens pallens was the largest in numbers collected, and represented 60.5% among the total collections. The other major species were Anopheles sinensis 16.4%), Aedes vexans nipponii 14.0%) and Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus 6.3%). The total numbers of males and females of the respective species collected at each station shown in table 1 indicate that 1 more males than females could be collected with the light traps in C. p. pallens and An. sinensis. while the relation was reverse in Ae. vexans nipponii and C. t. summorosus, and that 2 the numbers and ratios of An. sinensis, Ae. vexans nipponii and C. t. summorosus were much larger in rural areas of Gyoda and Nogami than in the rest two urban areas. In Nogami where the collections were made in a valley surrounded by mountains. five mosquito species not seen in other areas were collected, including Ae. hatorii which is known to breed in rock pools on river beds. Results of the survey at the four localities indicate that there is a remarkable difference in the seasonal prevalence among the mosquito species, as shown in Tables 2-5. C. p. pallens has the longest seasonal activities appearing almost all through the season of the collections, while C. t. summorosus is rather restricted in its activity in midsummer. An. sinensis is the intermediate of the previous species, while Ae. vexans nipponii has a peculiar pattern being abundant in early summer.

N2  - A colony of Culex pipiens pallens which was multiple-resistant or -tolerant to organophosphorus insecticides was found in central Honshu of Japan in August 1967. The LC-50's of 10 insecticides in the larvae were assessed by WHO test method as follows (the resistance ratio was shown in parenthis) : diazinon 0.18ppm (5.8), malathion 0.37ppm (12.3), fenitrothion 0.082ppm (12.1), fenthion 0.050ppm (23.8), dichlorvos 0.22ppm (6.9), trichlorfon 1.2ppm (12.0), Dursban 0.0071ppm (9.5), Abate 0.017ppm (29.8), bromophos 0.020ppm (5.4), S-4115 0.068ppm (19.4). In the locality, several organophosphorus insecticides such as diazinon, malathion, dichlorvos, fenthion and fenitrothion have been applied to the breeding sources in these 10 years. However, new insecticides, i. e. Dursban, Abate, bromophos and S-4115, have never been applied even if for the purpose of a field control experiment. Therefore, it is concluded here that higher LC-50's of the above four new insecticides have resulted from the cross resistance with some insecticide (s) ever used in the locality.

The total number of mosquitoes were 2, 266 belonging to 6 species of 3 genera. The majorities of the specimens collected were 1, 072 Culex pipiens complex (47.3%), 777 C. tritaeniorhynchus (34.3%) and 398 Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis (17.6%). Fifteen cases of Japanese encephalitis were recorded in Yamanashi Prefecture in 1967. The peak of the outbreak was observed in the late of August which was 3 weeks later than the highest prevalence of C. tritaeniorhynchus.

N2  - Since 1962, a long run project of the studies on the seasonal prevalence and JEV infection of the vector mosquito, Culex tritaeniorhynchus-vishnui complex, has been performed at a farm village near Fukuoka City, Uchihashi, Kasuyagun, Fukuoka Prefecture. In the present paper the results obtained in 1964 and 1965 are fully presented. The results and logical conclusions are summarized as follows : 1) Seasonal prevalence of the vector mosquito population : The abundant season of the vector mosquito was in the period from mid-July to mid-August in 1964 and in the period from late July to late August in 1965. 2) Natural infection of vector mosquitoes : The mosquito infections of the two years were very similar in the time of infection, the length of infection period and the isolation rate. Main period of the mosquito infection did not exceed four to five weeks, despite the fact that the vector mosquito population remained satisfactory for about eight weeks. This strongly suggests that the natural decrease of the infected mosquitoes may be due to the scarcity of amplifying hosts but not to the decline of the total population of vector mosquitoes. 3) Correlation between the mosquito infection and the epidemic of human encephalitis : Aside from the scattered occurrence of reported cases, the regular outbreak of confirmed cases yearly followed on the onset of the mosquito infection with the time lag of about two weeks, and the length of the epidemic corresponded approximately with that of the mosquito infection. A special attention should be paid to the difference between the mosquito infection in 1963 and those in 1964 and 1965 as of the epidemiological importance, because the epidemic of human encephalitis was far larger in the former year than in the latter years. The time of the mosquito infection was distinctly later in 1963 than in the subsequent two years. The significance of this problem will be elucidated in further studies.

N2  - Faunistic and ecological surveys of medically important mosquito species of Japan were made by the author during the period from 1961 to 1966. A total of 5, 200 larval habitatsin 542 localities covering all the prefectures of Japan were surveyed, and altogether about 60 species were collected. The specimens were identified by mature larvae or by adults. The mosquito species were classified tentatively into 24 groups according to their taxonomic and ecological status, and the geographic distribution, type of larval habitats and the relation with associated species were discussed for each species or group. The results are summarized in Table 1 to 3.

N2  - There are many papers dealing with the natural enemies of mosquito larvae. However, quantitative observations of their predative activity have not yet been presented in those works. The authors studied the predators on larvae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus Dyar, a vector of Japanese encephalitis virus, in the rice paddy field in Okayama, Japan, and determined their predative capacity in the laboratory. The names of predators and the maximum predative activity presented as "observed take-number of mosquito larvae" per day were given as follows : Cloeon dipterum (Mayfly) 5 nymphs 2/10, Aciagrion hisopa (Damselfly) 5 nymphs 2/10, Ceriagrion melanurum (Damselfly) 5 nymphs 2/5, Ceriagrion sp. (Damselfly) 5 nymphs 1/5, Copera annulata (Damselfly) a nymph 3/5, Crocothemis servilia (Dragonfly) a nymph 10/10 and 47/50, Sympetrum sp. (Dragonfly) a nymph 10/10 and 64/100, Anax parthenope julius (Dragonfly) a nymph 50/50 and 154/200, Sigara substriata (Water boatmen) 5 larvae 2/5, Laccotrephes japonensis (Water scorpion) a nymph 10/10, Ranatra chinensis (Water stick-insect) an adult 10/10, Notonecta triguttata (Back swimmer) 3 adults 50/50 and 154/200, Paraplea japonica 5 nymphs 3/5, Sternolophus rufipes (Water scavenger beetle) 5/5 and 15/20, Hydaticus grammicus (Water beetle) a larva 10/10 and Misgurnus fossilis an adult 5/5.

N2  - In order to know the efficiency of insecticide residual spray to Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus adults, the observations of the resting behavior of this species were carried out in the suburbs of Kawasaki, Japan, in the summer of 1967. The adult indoor resting collections were made in daytime by the hand-capture in human dwellings, a pig pen, poultry houses, glocery stores, store barns and so. The collections were identified by species and sorted out according to the blood digestion stages. Indoor resting densities of this species were rather low. Otherwise, the adult outdoor resting collections were undertaken from natural shelters, i. e. grass, crop field, paddy field and so. A number of adults were found in grass in daytime. The resting habit on walls of a pig pen which will accompany the biting activity towards pigs was observed throughout a night. The nocturnal rhythm with a light trap collection, which was hung just overhead the pigs, showed one peak at 21 : 00-22 : 00. It is interesting that the nocturnal rhythm of biting activities was almost similar to the catching rhythm of the light trap. The number of resting mosquitoes on a wall increased rapidly from about 19 : 30, and showed a peak at 24 : 00〜1 : 00. More unfed mosquitoes than fed ones were observed on the wall in the first half of the night, and the tendency retrogressed at about 3 : 00. From about that time, the resting mosquitoes decreased rapidly, perhaps owing to getting out of the pig pen. It seemed the resting in the pig pen at night was rather short and temporary. It may be concluded that this species is rather exophily throughout daytime and night.

N2  - Esterase inhibition by organophosphates or carbamates in the resistant houseflies has been studied by the thin layer electrophoresis developed by Dr. Ogita (1962). When the flies belonging to various colonies, such as RP, FC, 203d, Hokota, Dream-Island, 15th dumping Island and Matsudo dumping site, had been treated by topical application with fenthion, fenitrothion, dichlorvos and Nestyn, 0.1μg per female fly, these insecticides inhibited markedly faster migrating esterase bands E_2 and E_4, while diazinon or malathion failed to inhibit E_4 band. Oxon-type organophosphates such as isopropyl diazoxon were effective against the diazinon resistant colonies and strongly inhibited E_2 and E_4 bands. The mixtures of fenthion, fenitrothion, trichlorfon or Nestyn added with dichlorvos at a ratio of 1 : 1 clearly inhibited E_2 and E_4 esterases of the resistant flies. On the other hand, the mixtures of organophosphate (fenthion, fenitrothion or dichlorvos) and carbamate (Sevin, Dimetilan or Meobal) failed to inhibit E_4 esterase band.

N2  - Both adults and larvae of the flesh fly, Boettcherisca peregrina originally collected from Inokashira of Tokyo in 1966 and from Gyoda of Saitama Prefecture in 1965, were tested for γ-BHC resistance after being reared in laboratory. The final instar larvae were tested undre "the dilution contact method" in which the larvae were exposed for 48 hours to a thin layer of desired concentration of insecticide emulsion. The adults were assessed by the topical application test. The LC_<50> value in the larval tests was 3, 800 ppm for Inokashira colony and was 82 ppm for the Gyoda colony. The γ-BHC resistance of the Inokashira colony was enough high as to be 200 times than that of a susceptible colony. The Gyoda colony, on the contrany, showed only 4.3 times of the value as the resistance ratio. However, these resistant two colonies were found to be still susceptible to organophosphorus insecticides such as diazinon and fenthion. The LD_<50> value of the adult flies was 1.6μg per female fly in the Inokashira colony and was 0.11μg in the Gyoda colony.

N2  - Studies on cross resistance among several insecticides was carried out using diazinon-resistant and -susceptible colonies, malathion-resistant and -susceptible colonies, and fenitrothion-resistant and -susceptible colonies of Culex pipiens s. l. larvae. A formula was introduced to calculate the extent of cross resistance. The ratio of cross resistance of chemical B to chemical A (RCR_<B-A>) is shown by the following formula : [numerical formula] in which B max. and B min. are the maximum and minimum LD-50's of the chemical B, respectively, and B_A-max. is the LD-50 of B in the maximum Aresistant colony. In other words, B max. and B min. are the LD-50's in the homozygous resistant and homozygous susceptible colonies, respectively. The RCR can be given only when the values of B max. and B min. have been obtained. In the present studies, the RCR could be calculated only among three chemicals, i. e. diazinon, malathion and fenitrothion, because the maximum LD-50's of the other chemicals were not yet be given. The results are listed in Table. According to the results, diazinon-resistance and fenitrothion-resistance were completely crossed with each other, and malathion-resistance was crossed with diazinon-resistance of fenitrothion-resistance only in a lower level (c. f. RCR=) and vice versa. It was also concluded that diazinon-, malathion- or fenitrothion-resistance was not crossed with DDT-resistance, and diazinon- or fenitrothion-resistance was not crossed with dieldrin- or lindane-resistance. However, it seemed to be curious that the malathion-resistant and -susceptible colonies both selected from a mixed population showed similar and higher resistance to dieldrin than the original susceptible population.

N2  - 1) Laboratory tests were conducted on sterilizing effects of the chemosterilants, Metepa and Hempa, with a laboratory colony of the mosquito Culex pipiens molestus Forskal by a contact method. The adults of either of both sexes were brought to contact for 3 hours with the residue of the chemicals which had been sprayed on the filter paper in acetone solution and dried. The number of females which laid eggs, the average number of eggs per raft, and the sterility rate of the eggs in total were recorded. 2) After exposing the adults of both sexes to the residual deposit of 50ml of 0.1 percent solution of Metepa per square meter on filter paper for 3 hours, the sterility rate of eggs laid was 99.9 percent in average, while little effect was shown at 0.1 percent solution. 3) Hempa, when tested by the same method at a concentration of 1.0 percent, caused 99.7 percent sterility. However, this compound at concentration of 0.1 percent or less did not give satisfactory effects. 4) Another series of experiments were conducted to observe the differnce in the effectiveness of the compounds among sexes. Both chemosterilants were found effective when treated on the females, but ineffective on the males. 5) When both males and females were exposed to the residue made on the filter paper by spraying 2.5 percent acetone solution of Metepa at a dose of 50ml per square meter, 5 minutes contact was found enough to give nearly 100 percent sterility. With Hempa 3 hours contact was required to cause 93.3 percent sterility. It was shown that Metepa had a more immediate effect than Hempa. 6) The 50 percent sterilizing time (ST-50) of Metepa when both sexes were treated was estimated to be between 2 and 5 minutes under the described conditions, while that of Hempa turned out to be around 43 minutes. 7) The deposit of either Metepa or Hempa on the filter paper treated at a dose of 50ml of 2.5 percent acetone solution per square meter was tested on the sterilizing effect with both sexes of the mosquito at intervals up to 11 weeks after the spraying. The continuous and rapid loss of the effectiveness was observed with Metepa from over one week onward. After 6 weeks Metepa caused only 8.0 percent of sterility. On the other hand Hempa showed still 95.1 percent sterility effect even at 11 weeks, although a slight reduction in the effect was observed during 2 to 4 weeks from the spraying. 8) It was concluded that by the contact method of test on Culex pipiens molestus Forskal, Metepa showed effect but the activity of the deposit did not last long enough, while Hempa had a slower effect but were longer in the residual activity of the deposit.

N2  - Control experiments of Culex tritaeniorhynchus were carried out in a pig pen and in laboratory. In rapidity of knockdown assessed by Busvine-Nash method (WHO standard method), KT-50s of ronnel 1% emulsion and fenitrothion 0.5% emulsion were approximately 120 minutes each. In the film contact tests to the residues for limited time, the contact time for killing 50% of the mosquitoes was 2.75 minutes in ronnel and 9.0 minutes in fenitrothion. The resting time to the adult mosquitoes for blood sucking on pigs and human arms were estimated to be 5 min., 5 sec. and 10 min., 54 sec. respectively. Mortality of the fed and the unfed Culex tritaeniorhynchus which were resting on walls of the pig pen were 93.5% and 76.2% respectively, if all of the pigs had been sprayed with ronnel several hours before. When ronnel was applied not only to the pigs but also to all over the innor walls of the pen, the mortality of the fed and the unfed raised to 94.6% and 95.2%, respectively.

N2  - From the two plateaux demonstrated on a log time-probit percentage knockdown line (lt-p line) with the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, the composition ratio of three phenotypes of dieldrin resistance, i. e. homozygous susceptibles (SS), heterozygous hybrids (RS) and homozygous resistants (RR), is detectable. On the lt-p lines of chlordane and lindane, similar two plateaux were also shown. The composition ratio of three phenotypes with above three chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, i. e. dieldrin, chlordane and lindane, was evaluated to give the same value with each other. Therefore, it was concluded that the resistance to these three chemicals was completely crossed, and that perhaps the same gene was responsible to the resistance of the three chemicals. On the other hand, the resistance in the German cockroach to dieldrin, chlordane and lindane was concluded not to be crossed with three organo-phosphorus compounds, i. e. diazinon, fenthion and fenitrothion, as the result of the lt-p line tests.

N2  - Studies were carried out on the transition of the configuration ratio of three phenotypes, i. e. SS, RS and RR, or the gene frequency of dieldrin resistance in 7 closed laboratory colonies of Blattella germanica (L.), by analzing the log time-probit percentage knockdown lines. All colonies were shown to decrease markedly the resistant gene ratio during the rearing in closed populations and, for example, R ratio of the Kanda colony decreased from 38.8% to 1.1% in 2 years' rearing. Comparative studies were also carried out on the difference in the fecundity between SS and RR colonies separated both from the same colony of B. germanica (L.). No difference was shown in the number of larvae hatched from one female. The interval of the oviposition from the emergence to the 1st oviposition as well as that from the 1st to the 2nd oviposition had no difference between two colonies, but that of the RR colony from the 2nd to the 3rd was significantly longer than that of the SS colony. The longevity of adult females in the RR clony was significantly longer that of the SS colony. These differences in fecundity, however, were presumed not to be the main factor of the decrease of gene frequency of the dieldrin resistance in closed populations.

N2  - In January and March 1967, overwintering mosquitoes were collected in many different types of caves in Izu Peninsula and Chiba Prefecture. The numbers and species collected were 65♀♀ Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus, 16♀♀ and 1♂ C. kyotoensis, 242♀♀ C. orientalis, 45♀♀ C. pipiens pallens, 4♀♀ C. vorax and 1♀C. bitaeniorhynchus. It is evident that caves are important sites for overwintering of adult mosquitoes, especially for the vector of Japanese encephalitis virus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus. Trials for the isolation of Japanese encephalitis virus from these mosquitoes with the intracerebral inoculation into suckling mice and the plaque assay in the chick embryo cell culture were all negative. Results of the examination of ovariole relics indicated that all of 46 Culex tritaeniorhynchus summorosus dissected were nulliparous.

N2  - As a part of the eradication program for the Japanese encephalitis, which has been carried out by the Miyagi Prefectural Government, writers have been studying ecological problems of the mosquito, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, a vector of the disease. Kato's animal baited traps were set at 14 cow sheds at various sites (listed in Table 2) of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan in the summer of 1965 (dates of collection listed in Table 1), so that the invading mosquitoes were able to be collected. Following 8 species of mosquitoes were collected throughout the investigation period; Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex pipiens pallens, Aedes vexans nipponii, Armigeres subalbatus, Aedes flavopictus, Culex hayashii and Culex orientalis (Attached Tables 1 and 2), of which former 5 species were abundant (abundant species). The seasonal abundance of mosquitoes obtained in 1965 (Figs. 1 to 11) was discussed and compared with the results obtained in 1963 and 1964 with the abundant species. The results were summarized as follows : 1. From the species-number relationship of the mosquito population which invaded in the cow sheds (Figs. 12 to 14, Attached Figs. 1 to 4), the general mode of succession of the mosquito population in Miyagi Prefecture proceeds; Aedes vexans nipponii dominant→Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis dominant→Culex tritaeniorhynchus dominant, from early to middle summer and does inversely from middle summer to fall. 2. The mode of succession of the mosquito population structures can be grouped into four (Fig. 15) : i) the area where the population ends with the Culex tritaeniorhynchus・Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis (CT・AN) phase ; the mixed culture type (rice and other crops) area in southern part of the prefecture, for example, Kakuda and Iwanuma. ii) the rice paddy field area in northern parts of the prefecture where the population ends with the Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis・Culex tritaeniorhynchus (AN・CT) phase, for example, Furukawa, Tome, and Wakayanagi. iii) the area around the ii)-area where the population proceeds at most to the Anopheles hyrcanus sinesis (AN) phase, for example, Iwadeyama, Wakuya, and Tsukidate. iv) the urban area of the middle cities along the coast of the Pacific Ocean where Culex pipiens pallens participates as a dominant species, for example, Shiogama, Ishinomaki, and Kesennuma. 3. Culex tritaeniorhynchus emerges earlier in season and keeps high population levels throughout season in 1964 when the high incidence of the Japanese encephalitis was observed (Figs. 16 and 17). 4. The percentage rate of the number of Culex tritaeniorhynchus to the total number of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis in 11 localities in 1963, 1964, and 1965 is illustrated in Fig. 18. In this figure, the relative abundance of C. tritaeniorhynchus to An. hyrcanus sinensis is high in 1964. This high rate in the early season could be used for the prediction of the abundance of C. tritaeniorhynchus which is a main vector of the Japanese encephalitis.

N2  - During the period from January to December in 1965 and 1966, investigations on the annual succession of mosquito larvae occuring in tree holes were made in a zelkova forest in the suburbs of Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture. 1) The mosquito larvae and pupae obtained were 1, 029 individuals in 1965 and 945 individuals in 1966, and they were classified into 3 genera and 3 species in every year; Uranotaenia bimaculata 81.6% (1965) and 89.7% (1966), Aedes albopictus 9.3% and 5.4%, and Tripteroides bambusa 9.0% and 4.9%. 2) The seasonal prevalence of the mosquito larvae and pupae collected in both years was summarized as follows. Ae. albopictus and Tr. bambusa appeared first in mid-April; the former was collected until mid-October, while the latter until late September. Ur. bimaculata occured first in early July, and increased suddenly in number in early August when the above two species declined in number. Thereafter, this mosquito reached the maximum abundance during the period from late September to mid-November, and disappeared after the middle of December. 3) None of the mosquito larvae overwintered in the tree holes investigated, because the water of them dried up or froze in a frigid winter.

N2  - During a period from June to December, 1964, an investigation was carried out on mosquitoes inhabiting in the septic tanks in Kanagawa Prefecture and the results were summarized as follow. 1) In the cases of 1, 315 septic tanks which were widely distributed in Kanagawa Prefecture the mosquitoes were found in 467 of the cases (35.3%). Local difference of the occurrence was little significant. 2) Frequency of the mosquito occurrence in two types of the septic tanks was higher in the modified types than that in the standard type. 3) The mosquitoes were identified as Culex pipiens group, Armigeres subalbatus and Culex kyotoensis. Among them, Culex pipiens group was the dominant inhabitant in the septic tanks and sometimes it was found with Armigeres subalbatus in same tanks. Culex kyotoensis was collected only from two tanks which are situated aside of Lake Ashinoko, Hakone National Park. 4) Concerning problems of Culex pipiens group found inthe septic tanks, the autogeny of adult females and the DV/D ratio of male genitalia were examined. For this purpose, pupae and 4th instar larvae were collected as materials from 33 septic tanks in various localities and cultured during about 10 days in the laboratory condition. 5) According to the features of both autogeny and DV/D ratio, Culex pipiens group found in the septic tanks was able to subdivide into two forms, pallens and molestus. In most cases, the mosquitoes were found in a mixing population of two forms in most of the habitats with its ratio being not constant. In some cases, however, the habitats were occupied by only one of the mosquito, pallens or molestus. 6) It is quite probable that the septic tanks are demonstrating not only a considerable significance as a breeding site of the mosquitoes, but these are also playing an important role on the natural selection from pallens to the molestus-form.

N2  - 1. In order to determine the vectors of bovine Thelazia in this country, studies were made at several localities and two species of flies were determined. In an examination in Hokkaido throughout a year, only females of Musca convexifrons harboured thelazian larvae at the rate 2.04%, 65 flies out of 3, 183; and on Miyake Island of Tokyo in September, females of the same species harboured thelazian larvae at 0.53%, 7 out of 1, 310. At Oume of Tokyo, from May to November, Thelazian larvae were found from only females of Musca hervei at the rate 0.4%, 8 out of 2, 003. 2. Comparing the ability of transmission of bovine Thelazia between Musca convexifrons and Musca hervei, the former was thought to be an adequate vector of Thelazia rhodesi, because the species of Thelazia found in cows in Hokkaido and on Miyake Island was mostly T. rhodesi. The latter was found to be a vector of both T. skrjabini and T. rhodesi, because these Thelazia species were isolated in comparable numbers from the cows at Oume. 3. It was assumed that the development of the thelazian larvae in flies was different by the species of the host, for the body length of the infective larvae of Thelazia at full development was larger in Musca convexifrons than in Musca hervei.

N2  - 1. A seasonal prevalence of the horse-flies attacking cattles was investigated in the Kouzu pasture, Gumma prefecture for the year 1944 to 1946. About 50 cows of the Jersey race had been bred in that time in this pasture which was opened on the highland over 1000 meters level. 2. As shown in Table 1, twenty-nine species were collected in this pasture during three seasons. Among them, however, Stonemyia yezoensis, Chrysops basalis, C. suavis, Hybomitra arpadi, H. jersey, Atylotus horuathi, Tabanus miyajima, T. kinoshitai and T. iyoensis were very rare. Hybomitra jersey, Tabanus monomiensis and Chrysozona kouzuensis are the species which were described newly from this pasture as the type locality. 3. In each month from May to September, through three seasons, 4, 14, 25, 18 and 10 species were collected respectively. The largest numbers of species and of individuals were obtained in July, ined in second largest numbers of those were obta-and the August. 4. As is seen in Table 2, the result of quantitative evaluation of prevalence carried out in 1946 showed that Tabanus humilis was the most dominant species in number and Chrysozona rufipennis was next to this. Tabanus chrysurus, T. rufidens, T. fulvimedioides, T. amaenus, T. mandarinus and Chrysops japonicus were able to add further to the dominant species in which more than 50 individuals were collected. The activity of the horse-flies attacking cattles was largely affected by weather condition. 5. As shown in Table 4, the relation between the number of species and the number of individuals per species collected in a season was well described by Fisher's logarithmic distribution or by Preston's truncated discrete lognormal distribution as well. Intermediate steps for computing the statistics for both distributions were given in Table 3. From the result of application of the lognormal model, the estimated number of species that had not been captured was 11.39, it could be said that there is a possibility of finding some more species in the Kouzu pasture.

N2  - For the purpose of clarifying the life cycle, development and some other ecological features of Parasa consocia Walker, and also in order to establish the relationship of moth-dermatitis and this species of moth, this study was conducted from 1965 to 1966. The results are summarized below : 1) In general, emergence of the adult moth is observed once a year, in June, in Kagawa and Tokushima Prefectures, although a small number of individuals also emerge in autumn. 2) Hibernation of this species of moth occurs when the advanced larva is in the cocoon. 3) Developmental periods occupy : 4 days, in the egg; 37 days, in the larva (until cocoon formation); and on the average of 300 days, in the cocoon. But, for the small number of individuals that emerge in the autumn, the duration is about 40 days. 4) Eight instars are observed in the larval stage, but a small number of individuals appear to have nine instars. 5) The growth in the width of the larval headcapsule follows Dyar's formula, log y=a+bx. 6) The number of eggs per egg-mass is variable, and the average is very small, about 5-6 eggs. 7) Strong aggregative behavior is generally observed in the first instar larva. However, dispersal seems to occur in the second instar. 8) Cocoon formation takes place on the lower parts of the trunks of old hackberry trees, or in nearby places; cocoons can be found in cracks in the bark on the trunk, or in weeds near the roots, in a cocoon-mass of variable size. The surface of the cocoon is quite indistinct and wrapped in a rather coarse silk. 9) The cause of dermatitis in the human body seems due to a large number of spine on the old larval skin, adhering either to the coarse silk on the surface of the cocoon or scattered on the ground. Undoubtedly, there is some suffering caused by the sting from spines on the living larva.

N2  - The authors had an opportunity of examining rats and mice captured in the Yawata Iron and Steel Works during the period from September to October 1963 and in March 1964. The operations were carried out with cage traps and rodenticide "Kumaran" (coumarin derivative). The rats and mice were separately gathered at each site of the capture and preserved in 10% formalin. In the present paper, they reported on the species of rats and mice, the micro-habitats, the reproductive status and the measurements of external charactors of adult Rattus rattus. The results are summarized as follows : 1. The total number of rats and mice captured in autumn 1963 was 214 individuals, out of them R. rattus being 198 (92.2%), Rattus norvegicus 15 (7.0%) and Mus molossinus 1 (0.5%). In spring 1964, the total number of captured rats and mice was 101 individuals, R. rattus being 75 (74.1%), R. norvegicus 10 (10.0%) and M. molossinus 16 (15.9%). It is noticeable that the number of M. molossinus caught in spring is more than that in autumn. 2. In autumn numerous individuals of rats and mice were caught at resting room and the number captured decreased in order of office room and kitchen. In spring, however, R. rattus and M. molossinus were numerously captured at guardroom, resting room and dressing room. R. norvegicus was mostly caught at dumping place. 3. The bulk of female rats and mice captured in autumn and spring was oestrous, pregnant and lactating, and in the bulk of males the testes descended into the scrota. Therefore, the both females and males of R. rattus, R. norvegicus and M. molossinus were fecund in autumn and spring. 4. In R. rattus (♀53, ♂49), the average head and body length of adult females was 147.26±15.17mm; and that of males 149.45±10.08mm. The average tail length of females was 167.31±17.27mm; and that of males 163.45±15.46mm. The average hind foot length of females was 29.89±1.59mm; and that of males 30.59±2.02mm. The average ear length of females was 19.98±1.68mm; and that of males 20.18±1.37mm.

N2  - The rats and rat-fleas were studied in the harbor side area of Yokohama and Kawasaki ports during the period from 1952 to 1965. Captivity of Rattus norvegicus has been increasing since 1955 and its rate among captured rats became over 75 per cent in recent years. On the contrary, Rattus rattus reduced its captivity after 1955 when its capture rate was highest, 55 per cent, and is below 25 per cent in recent years. Number of fleas collected has been gradually reduced after 1959. Number of Xenopsylla cheopis showed a peak in 1954, has been abruptly reduced, remained 1 specimen in 1962 and disappeared thereafter. Nosopsyllus fasciatus had been increased its number till 1955 and similar number has been collected thereafter. Monopsyllus anisus showed its maximum captivity in 1959, reduced enormously thereafter and no specimen was collected each in 1961 and 1965.

N2  - From 278 overseas cargo ships fumigated with cyanogas, rats were found in an average of 10.8 per a vessel. The species and each rate to total rats were as follows : M. musculus 76.0%, R. rattus 23.3% and R. norvegicus 0.5%. The holds of vessels were most densely occupied by rodents with the rate 81.2% to total number, and the accomodation areas with a rate, 17.4% were secondarily invaded. In recent years, it is noticed that M. musculus becomes most abundantly invading vessels and the species was found from 46% of the vessels positive with rats. Invasion of rats was compared among different lines and nationalities. The invasion was measured by an average number of rats in a ship in each group. The highest invasion was seen in the south-east Asia service and in the Taiwan, Australia and India-Pakistan lines. Among nationalities, the highest was Norway, then Indonesia, Panama and Japan. Attention should be payed to the ships on those lines and in nationalities for preventing invasion of the foreign rat-born diseases.

The ships positive with X. cheopis were all on the Asian line and showed the positive rate 18.5% out of 27 ships on the same line. X. cheopis parasitized abandantly on M. musculus as much as on R. rattus and distributed in the various sections of the ships.

N2  - Laboratory tests on the effects of eleven insecticides against two colonies of the housefly, Musca domestica vicina Macquart collected from Kajiki of Kagoshima Prefecture in November of 1966, were carried out by topical application method, contact method to insecticide residues, spraying method and dipping method in laboratory. Insecticides used were as follows : dichlorvos, naled, diazinon, fenchlorphos, fenthion, fenitrothion, trichlorphon, malathion, dieldrin, lindane and DDT. Mortality after contact to the residues was higher in naled, diazinon, fenchlorphos, fenthion and fenitrothion. The others were less effective. Mortality in the spray tests was higher in dichlorvos, naled, diazinon, fenchlorphos, fenthion and fenitrothion ; and the others were less effective. In contact tests and spray tests, dichlorvos, naled and diazinon were more rapid in knockdown than the others. Both colonies of the housefly used were presumed to be the mixture of susceptible and resistant populations to dieldrin and lindane after the results of dipping tests.

N2  - A mature larva of a psychodid fly was recovered from the left eye of a 37 year old patient who was suffering from an irritative feeling of the eye. The larva was collected from water used to wash the eye of the patient, and was brought to the author for identification. The specimen was already at the mature stage and its digestive canal was clean. It was actively moving in water when first exmined by the author. It was transferred into a small glass vial on wet filter paper in order to recover the adult, but it died 2 days later without the pupation. The specimen was mounted in balsam medium for the detailed microscopical examination of the structure. The larva is 7mm long, body greyish white in general, and the head and siphon are dark brown. There are 3 plates on each of the abdominal terga VI and VII, 5 pairs of siphonal tufts and 4 valves on the siphon, which is slender and tapering. The specimen was identified as Psychoda alternata Say, 1824 from its morphological characters. This case is considered to be the first report on human ocular myiasis due to the psychodid larvae.

N2  - In the preceding experiments, methionine was found to enhance the attractiveness of mice for mosquito biting when an aqueous solution was inpregnated on the body surface. Further experimentation on this was conducted by injection of 0.1ml. of 0.5% methionine into a mouse intraperitoneally. Since there was no significant increase of methionine in the blood serum of the treated mice, and since blocking the metabolic pathways of methionine by addition of ethionine cancelled the enhanced attractiveness, some metabolites rather than the intact methionine were suspected to be responsible for this effect. Following the metabolic pathways of methionine in vivo, various probable metabolites were tested, and glycine was found to enhance attractiveness significantly, and cysteine and pyruvic acid somewhat less. Other probable metabolic compounds, creatine, choline and cystine, and taurine and urea actually detected by chromatographic analysis of the blood serum did not contribute to increased attractiveness. Since the contents of glycine and cysteine did not increase significantly in the blood serum when treated mice exhibited the enhanced effect, further metabolic compounds of these are suspected to be responsible for this. The desulfulization process of cysteine to pyruvic acid could not be related to this effect.

N2  - A series of studies on mosquitoes and their role as vectors of human diseases have been carried out by the members of our Department during the past ten years, and some of the results have been reported in connection with the epidemiology of filariasis in the Amami Islands. In this paper an account is given of a mosquito, Anopheles bengalensis, which was found in limpid waters of small streams, irrigation ditches, springs, stream beds, rock-pools etc. of lowland forests on Amami-oshima and Tokunoshima. These specimens are the northernmost collection yet of mosquitoes of the A. aitkenii group, which has not been collected from the other districts of Japan or from the Ryukyu Islands. Small, brownish and unspotted adult resembles A. aitkenii, A. fragilis and A. acaci. The dorsal lobe of the male claspette bears 2 club-like and 2 sword-like spines. The inner clypeal hairs of the larvae are 2 to 7 branched. Some morphological variations of the branches of inner clypeal hairs, abdominal lateral hairs III and the saddle hairs are shown in table 1.

N2  - The seasonal occurrence of the "Habu" viper, Trimeresurus flavoviridis, was observed from 1959 to 1962 through the captivity of the snakes. The number of the snakes captured and offered to the Health Center showed one prominent peak in June every years. The seasonal occurrence of the snake bite showed two peaks; one in June and another in early autumn. The loose correlation existed between the seasonal occurrence of the snakes and the snake bite (0.01<P<0.05). The activity of the snakes observed in a snake pit was absolutely nocturnal. In the time difference of the snake bite demonstrated by Sasa, Tanaka et al. (1956), the bite occurred mainly in the daytime making two peaks at 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. The close negative correlation was found between the hourly change of the snakes' activity and the snake bite (P<0.005). The hourly change of the bite occurrence was assumed not to be influenced by the change of the activity of the snakes but to be attributable to the human activity in the field.

N2  - Screening tests for various aerosol formulations of active insecticides necessitate a device which can deliver an accurate volume of aerosol insectisides at an extremely short period. For this need, an automatic mechanical device was invented. The present device is composed of a time gear which can be pre-set at any time between 0.1 sec. to 30 sec., and a magnet of which arm presses a nozzle button of an aerosol can with the constant pressure of 2kg/cm^2. A spring coil on the nozzle button, instead, pushes back the magnet-arm to cases spraying when an electric current is cut off automatically. By spraying the aerosol containing 0.3% DDVP, 0.1% pyrethrin and 1 mC of P^<32> in 90ml of xylene through 50cm long, and 9cm wide glass cylinder kept horizontally under a hood, 10 house flies were exposed at the other end of the cylinder for a test. Eight time repetitions were made for each spraying test pressed by either the device or a finger. At 10 seconds after puffing the aerosol, the air under the hood was ventilated and the number of house flies was counted. The doses of insecticide attached to house flies were calculated from the radioactivities picked up. The device was satisfactory on the following points and proved to be useful for testing aerosol formulations of active insecticides : 1) KT-50s increased proportionately with increase of the reciprocal values of time when sprayed by the device, however, irregularly by the finger. Especially, in such an extremely short spray as 0.2 sec. the finger could not control the time and tended to press longer. The standard deviations of the knock-down time were smaller when pressed by the device than by finger. This fact is of prime importance since the smaller deviations make the comparison among different candidate formulations more accurate. 2) The radioactivities, namely, the doses of insecticides picked by house flies also showed the proportional increase in accordance with increase of spraying periods when pressed by the device, but not so by finger. The standard deviations of the radioactivities of house flies were, however, indifferent between the tests by the device and by finger. There was a fine linear relationship between the log.-KT-50 and the log.-mean volume of insecticide attached to the house flies.

N2  - Laboratory tests were conducted on sterilizing effects of the chemosterilants, metepa and hempa on a laboratory colony of the mosquito Culex pipiens, form molestus. The chemicals, mixed with sugar solution, were applied to the adults by a bait method and dissolved in water at given concentration to the larvae by a dipping method. Results recorded were; the numbers of egg rafts produced per female; the average number of eggs per raft; and the sterility rate of the eggs in total. After exposure of mixed populations of males and females to baits of sugar solutions containing 0.1 and 0.01 percent of metepa, the sterility rates were 83.7 and 78.2 percent, respectively, while little effect was seen with 0.001 percent solution of the same compound. A solution of 0.1 percent hempa applied by the same method was effective also, and caused of a sterility rate of 91.3 percent. However this compound at concentrations of 0.01 percent and less did not give satisfactory results. Another series of experiments were conducted for the purpose of observing the effectiveness of the compounds according to sex. Males and females were exposed to given concentrations of the chemosterilants in separate cases, and were released in other cages together with males and females, both either treated or untreated. In the population composed of males and females both treated with 0.01 percent of metepa, the sterility rate was almost 100 percent. In the populations with only the males or only the females treated, the rates were 92.4 percent and 92.6 percent, respectively. Metepa showed almost equal effects on both sexes, while hmeap was apparently more effective against the females than against the males. The 50 percent sterilizing concentration (SC-50) of metepa in treatments of both sexes was estimated to be between 0.001 and 0.01 percent under the above conditions, while that for hempa turned out to be around 0.01 percent. No noticeable reduction in mating activity was seen in males thus treated with chemosterilants. In the populations exposed to 0.01 percent solution of metepa and 0.1 percent of hempa for 24 hours in larval stages, remarkable reductions were seen in the number of egg rafts deposited, and the sterility rate of the eggs reached to 50.8 and 98.4 percent, respectively. However, few effects were seen with the solutions of lower concentrations for both compounds, while those of higher concentrations such as 0.1 percent hempa were also ineffective as chemosterilants because the mortalities in the larval stages were extremely high due to the toxicity of the compounds. It is therefore considered that practical application as larval chemosterilants might be difficult since the range of effective concentrations of these two compounds seems to be quite narrow.

N2  - Sterilizing effectiveness of gamma radiation with Co^<60> or chemosterilants on the engorged female cattle tick, Boophilus microplus, was determined. Doses of 10 to 100 kr were inhibitory to oviposition. A 50% hatchability was shown by eggs deposited by females irradiated at a dose of about 0.5kr. Thiotepa was the most potent sterilant of the chemicals tested, and followed by apholate and metepa in this regard. Hempa was lower in the degree of effectiveness than any other chemicals tested. In these chemosterilants, a 50% sterilizing dose were in a range from 1.5 to 2500γ per gram of body weight by topical application. These results were similar to those obtained from many other insecti- and acaricides having an oviposition-inhibiting action upon the tick.

N2  - An experiment on the insecticidal effect of the emulsion of BHC, Sevin, and of their mixture (1; 1, v/v) on the common housefly, Musca domestica vicina, was carried out in 1964 at Miki-cho, Kagawa Prefecture. The results were summarized as follows : 1) The effect of BHC-emulsion on the adult fly was much greater than that of Sevin-emulsion, and the mode of action of both insecticides to the fly seemed to be different from each other. 2) The equivalent mixture of BHC-emulsion and Sevin-emulsion did not show any particular action such as synergistic action, but showed only the independent joint action.

N2  - The studies on the effect of some organophosphorus compounds against dieldrin-resistant and -susceptible colonies of Blattella germanica were carried out. The residue of diazinon, fenitrothion or fenthion was highly effective to the dieldrinresistant colony, as well as to the dieldrin-susceptible colony. The contact only for 10 to 60 minutes to the residue of 2.5g/m^2 of each compound was enough to kill all of the female cockroaches within 6 days after the contact. Meanwhile, dieldrin and chlordane were far less effective to dieldrin-resistant roaches. The continuous contact for 2 days to the residue of 2.5g/m^2 of both chemicals could kill only 23% of the resistant roaches, though the contact for 2 to 10 minutes was enough to kill all of the susceptible roaches. In the fumigating tests of lindane and of the mixture of lindane and dichlorophos, both of them were less effective to dieldrin-resistant colony than to dieldrin-susceptible colony.

N2  - A new species of the Listrophorid mites, Alabidocarpus fujii n. sp., was found from the Japanese long-winged bat, Miniopterus schreibersii niponiae, collected at Miyazaki, Shizuoka and Chiba, Japan. This species is most closely related to A. calcaratus Lawrence, 1952, but the two species deffer in the shape of propodosomal shield and of tarsi of first and second legs. According to the key to the species of Alabidocarpus by Pinichpongse, this new species falls into A. longipilus Pinichpongse, but A. fujii is much larger and has minute setae on mid-dorsum at the level of leg IV. Holotype : Female is deposited in The National Science Museum (Zoology), Tokyo, Japan; (NSM-AC-P 280).

N2  - Using a colony of Laelaps nuttalli collected from rat in the area of epidemic haemorrhagic fever the authors studied its food and blood feeding habits under laboratory condition. Adult and 1st and 2nd nymph of this species fed well on oil in fluid group of food and in solid one they fed very well on boiled egg yolk of chicken, and blood cake (human, rat and chicken) were engorged into their digestive organs. The mite did not attempt to feed unbroken skin of the hosts.

N2  - 1. Tests were conducted to determine susceptibility of eight species of mosquitoes to infection with microfilariae of Dirofilaria immitis. Highest infection rates and largest numbers of infective larvae were found in specimens of Aedes togoi fed on an infected dog and examined 12 days thereafter. Other species tested were Culex pipiens fatigans, Culex pipiens pallens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti, Armigeres subalbatus, and Anopheles sinensis. 2. There were no outstanding differences in D. immitis infection rates among Aedes togoi of four age groups allowed to feed on an infected dog. 3. Microfilariae in peripheral blood of a dog under treatment for dirofilariasis during a 21 day period remained infective for mosquitoes, Aedes togoi, fed on the dog on 10 days during the course of treatment. Decline in numbers of microfilariae in blood of the dog was much more rapid than decline in numbers of infective immitis larvae in mosquitoes which had been fed on the dog and dissected 12 days thereafter. 4. In surveys of microfilaremia among dogs at Kochi, Shikoku the factors which showed most striking correlation with high incidence of infection with D. immitis were age and habitat. Dogs from wooded foothills outside Kochi City proper showed a much higher microfilaremia rate than those from urban Kochi and from a seaside area near the city. Short haired dogs showed an infection rate nearly twice that of long haired animals, and males were infected nearly twice as frequently as females. 5. Only eight of 1, 813 adult female mosquitoes of seven species obtained in light traps, and in resting and biting collections in the vicinity of dog kennels at the seaside, urban Kochi, and wooded suburban foothills 7, 000-10, 000 meters from urban Kochi were infected with larvae of Dirofilaria immitis. Five of these were specimens of Culex fatigans, the remaining three were examples of Aedes togoi. Four of the infected C. fatigans were collected at the seaside area, and one was found in urban Kochi. The three infected specimens of Aedes togoi were found in the wooded foothills, the only area where this mosquito was most numerous.

N2  - The authors examined the fleas collected by Mr. T. Miyao and others from small mammals on the Oki Islands in March, 1966. In those fleas, a female specimen of Rhadinopsylla biloba, having a well developed genal comb, which was not previously recorded from the outside of Kyushu, was contained. It was necessary to make a thorough investigation into the flea occurring on the islands. The authors caught small mammals on the Oki Islands during the period from 16 to 21 in December, 1966, and collected fleas from them. The results of the examination of hosts and fleas were as follows : 1) The total of 74 hosts examined were composed of 32 examples of Urotrichus talpoides minutus, 27 of Apodemus speciosus navigator, 14 of A. argentus celatus and 1 of Mus musculus molossinus. 2) U. talpoides minutus was trapped everywhere traps were set, on sunny places and in forests. The two mice of the genus Apodemus were obtained in the almost same areas, however, more careful observation revealed that the habitat of A. argenteus celatus was associated more deeply with the evergreen deciduous forest. 3) The flea fauna of the Oki Islands was not so rich and contained only 3 species of fleas, Palaeopsylla nippon, Neopsylla sasai and R. biloba. 4) P. nippon was found on the majority of the moles examined. R. biloba occurred on the two mice of the genus Apodemus, whereas N. sasai was confined to A. speciosus navigator. 5) R. biloba obtained on the islands had no morphological differences as compared with the specimens from Kyushu. The well developed genal comb of the female specimen, mentioned above, was ascribed to individual variation. 6) On the Oki Islands, R. biloba was distributed in the very low altitude and appeared not to be rare. 7) The record of R. biloba from the islands might serve as a basis for an expectation of its occurrence in the Chugoku district of Honshu.

N2  - The author presented data and discussion on the relationship between the body weights of pupae of house flies, Musca domestica vicina Macq., reared under different population densities of larvae, and number of matured eggs in ovaries of female flies which were emerged from their pupae. A 2 : 1 mixture of wheat bran and powder of fish scrap was used for culture of larvae. Larvae were cultured under different population densities in this medium. Pupae were picked up from the culture medium and their body weights were measured by the torsion balance. The pupae were grouped by their body weight into 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25 and 26-30mg. On the day of emergence the flies were brought into the cages and were fed by means of cotton ball soaked with milk. Three-to-four-day-old gravid female flies were anesthetized with ethyl ether and the abdomen were fixed in formaldehyde solution. Later, the ovaries were dissected and numbers of matured eggs were counted. The results were as follows. Frequency curve of number of eggs in ovaries showed the normal distribution. The curves moved towards the side of the larger number of eggs when the body weight of pupae were heavier (Fig.1). The average number of eggs in the group of 6-10mg of pupal body weight was 47, and the maximum value was observed in the group of 26-30mg as 156. The values of number of eggs were seen to fall on a straight line (Fig.2). The comparative observation was made by examining the differences between laboratory colonies of vicina-form originated from the wild strain in Osaka and of domestica-form (CSMA) originated from U.S.A. Using pupae of 21-25mg of body weight, the average number of eggs in ovaries observed to be 127 and 135 respectively, and no significant difference could be detected.

N2  - Throughout the year of 1962 flies were collected by the traps with poison bait, containing 0.5% of DDVP and 10% of mollasses in water mixed with 1.2% of isopropyl alcohol, at a hutch where many rabbits were bred located in the center of Kyoto City (A station) and at a farm house in the suburbs of Kyoto City (B station). At B station, survey of flies by trap with fish entrail were carried out to estimate for attractiveness of poison bait to flies at the same time. Trap with poison bait was set successively but changed for new one every five days and flies collected were taken to laboratory. Twenty-four-hour collection using trap with fish entrail was carried out three times at most a month; 28 times in total in a year. At A station, 14, 899 individuals of 12 species were collected by trap with poison bait. Of these species, Fannia canicularis (95.7%) was largest in number, Muscina stabulans (2.1%) was next to it and the other species were rather rare. At B station, 16, 711 individuals of 18 species were collected by trap with poison bait. Of these species, Fannia canicularis (33.0%), Muscina stabulans (32.8%) and Phaenicia cuprina (13.8%) were large in number, and Musca vicina (8.8%) and Aldrichina grahami (4.9%) came next. And 2, 515 individuals of 21 species were collected by trap with fish entrail, of which Aldrichina grahami, Calliphora lata, Sarcophaga peregrina, Phaenicia cuprina and Muscina stabulans were large in number (21.3%, 13.0%, 12.4%, 12.1% and 9.9%, respectively). Seasonal abundance of flies collected are shown in Fig.1, 2 and 3. At A station, Fannia canicularis was collected from late in February to the middle of November and maximum population occurred towards July, and Muscina stabulans was collected from early in March to early September. At B station, Fannia canicularis and Muscina stabulans were collected from mid-March to mid-November by trap with poison bait, and Fannia canicularis was collected at intervals from mid-April to late in October and Muscina stabulans from mid-March to late in November by trap with fish entrail. Both these species were occasionally collected by trap with poison bait even when these were not collected by trap with fish entrail. The results mentioned above indicate that poison bait is more attractive than fish entrail for collecting these species. Phaenicia cuprina, Phaenicia sericata and Sarcophaga peregrina were collected from mid-May to late in October, from early in July to late in October and from mid-March to late in October, respectively, by trap with poison bait. And Phaenicia cuprina and Sarcophaga peregrina were collected for a longer period by trap with fish entrail; from April to December and from April to November, respectively. Aldrichina grahami and Calliphora lata were not collected in summer by both traps and during from November to February. Larger specimens of each species in total were collected by trap with fish entrail than poison bait, in spite of shorter collecting time. The results concerning Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae mentioned above indicate that during the lower temperature seasons, poison bait is less attractive than fish entrail for flies belonging to these Families. An outstanding feature found in the trap with poison bait is that the number of flesh flies, Sarcophagidae, was less attracted than various species of flies collected. The reason why a few flesh flies were collected may be due to isopropyl alcohol used as fly attractant which might be inadequate to stimulate the olfaction of flesh flies. In the case of collecting flies, a chemical bait containing one odorous material will be brought about uncertain results on fly population.

N2  - 1) In order to determine quantitatively the activity of the "Habu" (Trimeresurus flavoviridis), the appearing number of the snakes was observed hourly in the snake pit at Naze Health Center in which 30 snakes were released. In the observations made during the period from 19th to 24th, April 1964, the snakes hid themselves under the dome nests in the daytime and active movement was seen at night from sunset to sunrise with one prominence of activity curve at around 1 a.m. The activity was correlated to the change of the temperature and humidity besides the intensity of illumination. The occurrence of the snake bite was not parallel with this periodicity of the snakes' activity, and the movement of man was considered to be more important factor at the snake bite. 2) The capture rates of the trap boxes were tested in the snake pit. The comparison was made among difference of types of boxes and between presence or absence of a live rat in a trap. The capture rates were different among the types but indifferent to the presence of the rats. The snakes are not sensitive to presence of rats as an attractant.

N2  - To determine the effect of chemosterilants on the mating behavior of house flies, experiments were conducted with male flies sterilized with Hempa. Each pot contained 5 or 10 males and equal females, respectively. Different ratios of sterilized or normal males were used to establish the desired competitive ratio. In two experiments, the percentage of sterile eggs produced by normal females exposed to the males with different ratio of the normal and chemosterilized ones was almost same as, or slightly less than the expected level. It seems that Hempatreated males are sexually as competitive as, or slightly less vigorous than normal males.

N2  - Synergistic actions of S-421 were tested by the Nagasawa's settling mist apparatus, topical application method, abdominal injection method and Leg-Jerk method against the house fly Musca domestica vicina Macqu. The results may be summarized as follows : The knock-down effect of S-421 was high when it was used at high concentrations. The lethal effect of S-421 was stronger than other synergists. The synergistic effect of S-421 evaluated in the abdominal injection method was lower than evaluated by the topical application method. Entomograms of allethrin, pyrethrins, synergists and pyrethroid plus synergists are shown in Fig. 2. It was observed during the test in the Leg-Jerk method that synergistic effect of S-421 increased in the activity of the house fly.

N2  - The effect of a new rodenticide, norbormide, 5-(α-hydroxy-α-2-pyridylbenzyl)-7-(α-2-pyridylbenzyl-idene)-5-norbornene-2, 3-dicarboximide, to some species of rodents was assessed by several lavoratory and field tests. Dose to kill a wild Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, was found to be 20-30mg/kg by oral administration. But administrations of over 4, 000mg/kg to the mouse, 500mg/kg to Microtus montebelli and 500mg/kg to the cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus, were not effective. This compound was proved to be selectively toxic to rats. Most of the wild Norway rats died within 1 hour after the oral administration of 30mg/kg of norbormide, and it showed the rapid action of the chemicals. The shyness to the bait with norbormide was not concluded, because, in one case rats seemed to show shyness to the bait and in the other case they seemed not. In field tests using 0.5% norbormide bait in a wooden apartment house (A) and in two poultry farms (B&C), the control was achieved up to the degree of 76.3% in A, 42.5% in B, and 81.7% in C. The number of the dead rodents discovered after the control procedure was 1 of R. rattus and 1 of M. musculus in A, 32 of R. rattus in B and 19 of R. norvegicus in C.

N2  - In order to know the relationship of flies with the food pollution, the quantity of bacteria carried by them was studied fundamentally in the present study and the following results were obtained. The pathogenic bacteria (Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi murium) which were taken by flies in their larval stage were extinguished in the pupal stage, but the pupal content, harbouring non-pathogenic bacteria, did not become an aseptic state. At ordinary creeping of the adult flies, the transmission of bacteria was mainly the mechanical dissemination by means of adhesion of bacteria to tarsi. The quantity of bacteria attached to the tarsi was proportional to the density of bacteria on the materials on which flies creeped. The maximum value of bacterial transmission was observed when a fly creeped on the materials of which water content was 30 per cent and viscosity was 180.

N2  - A study on the biology, especially on the egg laying, development and the survival of the adult of Aedes albopictus SKUSE was carried out in 1965 and the following results were acquired : 1. About 80% of the number of the blood-sucked female adults gathered in summer from the bush at the beginning of the study, normally laid their eggs in the rearing container. They laid out 80% of the number of eggs for 3-5 days after the introduction of the female adults under the constant temperature of 25℃. 2) The total number of eggs laid out per female mosquito is about 80 on the average. 3) The developmental period in days of each stage of this species of mosquito is : egg 8.1 days, larva 10.2 days, pupa 5.9 days and total 24.3 days under the temperature of 20℃, egg 3.8 days, larva 7.5 days, pupa 2.4 days and total 13.7 days under 25℃ temperature, and egg 3.8 days, larva 5.9 days, pupa 2.3 days and total 12.0 days under 30℃ temperature. As the developmental zero point the following values are presumed : 10°-11℃ for egg, 9℃ for larva, 11.5°-13.5℃ for pupa and 9°-10℃ for all the developmental stage. 4) The duration of survival of the adult male is shorter than that of the female under 25℃. Generally speaking, they live for 6-7 days on the average in the rearing with water only and for 21-26 days in that with 20% sugar water respectively. However, the duration of their survival seems to become longer to some extent than the duration above mentioned, if the rearing container is suitable enough.

N2  - Experiments were made to investigate the inactivating effects of parathion and fenitrothion on mosquito larvae lived in culture media of microorganisms. From experimental results, remarkable reductions of effectiveness were seen in culture with 1% of peptone containing bacteria of Pseudomonas ovalis IAM 1069, Pseudomonas aeruginosa IAM 1007, Pseudomonas aeruginosa OTU 8252, Pseudomonas aeruginosa HO, Pseudomonas fragi IAM 3458, Pseudononas fragi IAM 1650, Pseudomonas cruciviae IAM 1048, Pseudomonas aureofaciens IAM 1001, Bacillus subtilis 10, Bacillus megaterium IAM 1166, Bacillus cereus IAM 1072 and Bacillus macerans IAM 1227. It was also determined that nitrophenol and nitrobenzene did not convert to aminophenol and aniline, though parathion and fenitrothion were converted to amino-parathion and amino-fenitrothion, respectively, in the presence of these microorganisms.

N2  - Very few informations with regard to the insecticide resistance of medical flies are available other than the house fly. In this paper, γ-BHC resistance in a flesh fly, Boettcherisca peregrina, which is a main pest in the privy-pot of our native-type lavatories, was reported. The flies collected from Yushima, Tokyo, in 1962, and Ohmiya, Saitama Prefecture, in 1964 were tested after being reared in laboratory and compared with a susceptible strain maintained in our insectarium since 1956. For detecting the resistance of the larvae, the last instar larvae were tested under the author's "dilution contact method" in which the larvae were exposed to a thin layer of desired concentrations of insecticide emulsion for 48 hours and the mortality was counted. The adults were assessed by topical application test. The LC-50 values in the larval tests were 19ppm in susceptible strain, 125ppm in Yushima colony and 500ppm in Ohmiya colony. Both colonies, Yushima and Ohmiya, were, consequently, fairly resistant to γ-BHC, showing 6.6 and 26.3 folds respectively as resistance ratio. Their resistance seem to be caused by frequent spraying with γ-BHC emulsion over the privy-pots. The LD-50 values in the adult flies were 0.08μg per female fly in susceptible strain, 0.1μg in Yushima and 0.26μg in Ohmiya. Though the latter colony is certainly resistant to γ-BHC, the resistant level is not so remarkable as shown of their larval stage. It was also confirmed, using fenthion emulsion to the larvae, that the γ-BHC resistant Ohmiya colony is still susceptible to it.

N2  - Insecticide resistance level of two different colonies of the larva of Simulium ornatum was compared. One colony was taken at Chino, Nagano Prefecture, where frequent control by DDT or diazinon was made for more than five years, another colony was taken at Saku, Nagano Prefecture, where no insecticide control was made due to the regulation of local fish culture. A rather simple test method was adopted and satisfactory results were obtained. Larvae are dipped in each the emulsions for ten minutes and mortality was observed after 24 hours in aerated water. The Chino-colony showed in LC_<50> about 10 fold greater in DDT, diazinon and fenthion than that of Saku-colony. These results may be due to the fact that the Chino-colony has experienced past insecticide pressure. At present the following sequence in the efficiency of these insecticides can be mentioned for this species. fenthion=fenitrothion>diazinon>trichlorfon>DDT

N2  - A series of field control tests against diazinonresistant housefly larvae applying organophosphorus emulsions to manure heaps were made during June 1965 to July 1966 in Mihara area of Hokota Village, Ibaraki Prefecture. The results may be summarized as follows : Larvicidal treatments of fenitrothion or fenthion, at the dosage of 0.25 gram in active ingredients per square metre which has been recommended in the table prepared by Ministry of Health and Welfare, revealed unsatisfactory against the larvae in manure heaps, but they could be controlled by adding the dose up to 1.25 gram. Fenthion was the most effective, fenitrothion comes the next, but diazinon was naturally far inferior to them at the same dose of 1.25 gram. Against the larvae of Stomoxys calcitrans, fenthion and fenitrothion proved most effective and dichlorvos was the next.

N2  - An experiment was made on mosquito control using fenitrothion (Sumithion) in a hamlet at a site formerly used for salt -fields in a suburb of City of Sakaide, Kagawa Prefecture in July 1965, and following results were acquired. 1) The six species of mosquitoes such as Culex pipiens pallens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Armigeres subalbatus, Aedes togoi, Aedes albopictus and Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis were observed at the experimental area and its vicinity, and several noticeable breeding places of Culex pipiens pallens were found there. 2) Application of the insecticide in this experiment seems to have been successful, judging from the data of the number of mosquitoes invaded the residences in this area at night and that of the number of mosquitoes captured by the light trap set by the main breeding place. 3) The number of Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis captured by the light trap was especially large in the latter part of July. Perhaps this state was due to the remarkable emergence of the species at this time of the year in paddy-fields around the experimental area.

N2  - Changes in the age-composition of a Culex pipiens molestus population at an underground breeding site in downtown of Tokyo were observed from December 1963 to April 1964. Mosquito collections were made with a sucking tube once in a week or two and their ages were determined by counting numbers of relics in the ovarioles. The breeding place is located at the bottom of a building and was observed to be well closed and isolated from outside. Not a single blood-fed mosquito was collected. The population was apparently having been maintained by autogenous proliferation. 318 out of 794 total number of dissected female mosquitos were found parous, however, only 5 among them were biparous and none triparous or over. The development of follicles was observed extremely retarded in the parous mosquitos. The evidences indicated that under the circumstance without blood sources the mosquitos principally laid eggs only once in a lifetime. A period analysis showed that the parous rate fluctuated at 6 week interval. The room temperature was at a fairly constant level from 15°to 20℃ and the temperature of breeding water at 13°to 16℃ during the period of observation. There were no correlation observed between the parous rate and the environmental conditions. So the periodical changes in the parous rate might be interpreted as a result of the periodical reproduction of the population. An exceeding correlation between the parous rates and the mating rates could be observed.

N2  - To search for the factors of producing hypopus in grain mites, the author observed changes of population and age composition in Lardoglyphus konoi through breeding experiments under different relative humidities on the following series of diets. About 300 mites were inoculated on 10g of diets composed of dried fish meal powder (niboshi) at the ratio of 10 : 0, 8 : 2, 6 : 4, 4 : 6, 2 : 8, 0 : 10 respectively, and each of these series was kept under the relative humidities 64%, 75%, 85%, and 94%, in an incubator at 25℃. At 94% R. H., slight reproduction occurred in 2 weeks but diminished till following week. In each series, the highest count of mites was observed under 85% R. H., but the longevity did not last for 5 weeks. The highest count of all the cases, 1640 individuals per 0.5g, was seen on 0 : 10 fish meal diet at 4 weeks under 85% R. H. The time to reach the highest count became shorter in accordance with the ratio of fish meal in diets increased. The period of existence was longest at 75% R. H. that lasted for 11 weeks especially on 6 : 4 and 4 : 6 fish meal diets. At 64% R. H. the mites could not survive. As for the age composition the following three phases were distinguished : Growing phase, in which the population in larval stage was highest, stable phase, the population in each stage appeared on the average and senile phase, the population in adult was highest. The age composition under 75% R. H. which showed either growing or stable phase in process of increase turned gradually into senile phase, and diminished after the climax. As to the 6 : 4 and 4 : 6 fish meal diets, the senile phase after the climax changed once into growing phase in 9 weeks and into senile again the following week. Under 85% R. H., change of the age composition took two types according to the diets : growing phase at 2 weeks, senile at 3 weeks and stable at 4 weeks on 10 : 0 to 4 : 6 fish meal diets, whereas on 2 : 8 and 0 : 10 fish meal diets growing and senile phase respectively at 2 weeks, both senile at 3 weeks and both growing again at 4 weeks. The hypopus appeared in 10% after 4 weeks on 2 : 8 fish meal diet under 75% R. H., while they were scarcely found under the other relative humidities in this experiments.

N2  - The mode of inheritance of malathion resistance among larvae of Culex pipiens fatigans was studied. A homozygous susceptible colony (SS) was separated from a mixed field population by the same method as adopted in the separation of dieldrin- or DDT-susceptible colonies. This method is as follows : Larvae from an egg-raft are reared in a vessel. Twenty or thirty of 3 rd-instar larvae from each egg-raft are exposed to a dipping test. If higher mortality is evident, the remaining larvae were pooled to produce the next generation. After repeating the procedure for 8 generations, a homozygous susceptible colony was established. The homozygous resistant colony (RR) was obtained by selection with the pressure of malathion. The ld-p line (log dosage-mortality regression line) of the hybrids (F1) after crossing the susceptible colony with the resistant one was straight and was located intermediate to the RR and SS lines as shown in Fig. 3. The progeny of the back cross of F1 with SS (P) showed a curved ld-p line with one plateau at about 50% mortality, and of F1×RR (P), an inflection point at about 50% mortality as shown in Fig. 5. F2 obtained from mass-mating of F1 showed a curved ld-p line with one plateau at about 25% mortality and with one inflection point at about 75% mortality as shown in Fig. 4. In view of the results mentioned above, the authors were led to the conclusion that the mode of inheritance of malathion-resistance in C. p. fatigans was autosomal and monofactorial, and that the resistant factor was partially dominant to the susceptible one. By drawing an ld-p line of malathion on logprobability paper using the larvae of any population and by determining the plateau in the ld-p curved line, the configuration ratio of SS : (RS+RR) in the population might be estimated easily.

N2  - Two colonies of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Alcaligenes viscolactis var. were isolated from water containing laboratory animal food, after incubation for a week at 28℃. Reduction of the effects of parathion, methylparathion, fenthion, DDT, diazinon, fenitrothion and lindane on mosquito larvae by these colonies was tested. Fenitrothion, parathion and methyl parathion were converted to non-toxic materials such as amino-fenitrothion, amino-parathion and amino-methylparathion within 1 to 2 days in living bacterial cells of the two colonies. The effects of fenthion, DDT, diazinon and lindane lasted 16 days under these conditions even though some reductions or conversions of the toxicants were apparent.

N2  - Laboratory tests on the sterilizing effect of Metepa and Hempa to house flies were conducted. The chemicals were treated to adult flies by topical application method and by bait method with milk solution. Treatments of Metepa by topical application caused a reduction in the number of eggs produced and of larvae hatched out. Males were more affected than females. ED-50 value, when treated to both sexes, was approximately 7.5μml. When treated female crossed with normal male, ED-50 was approximately 30μml. In the test of bait treatment, the reduction of egg production was more remarkable in the case of crossing of treated females with normal males than in the reverse case. When a small dose of Hempa less than 80μml per fly was topically treated, the egg production was not affected, but most of the eggs could not hatch out in the doses of 20〜80μml. ED-50 of Hempa was estimated to be approximately 25μml per fly. Bait treatment of Hempa with a higher concentration than 0.25% was proved to make the flies completely sterile.

N2  - Co-operative effects of two kinds of synergists mixed with allethrin were observed and compared with each other using Film and Nagasawa's Methods. Several rates of mixture of two kinds of synergists out of 4 (piperonyl butoxide, S-421, Synepirin-222 and Synepirin-500) were made and 6 of those, see Table 2, were tested on the hous fly, Musca domestica vicina of Takatsuki lineage. Mixed rate of allethrin and synergists was 1 : 5 and those of two co-operative synergists were 100 : 0, 80 : 20, 60 : 40, 40 : 60, and 20 : 80. The values of co-operative effects were calculated by Buchfield Method. Antagonistic relations were observed between two kinds of synergists except of piperonyl butoxide and Synepirin-500. So the author came to conclusion that co-operative effect of synergists is hopeless as far as allethrin is used as effective insecticide except of special case.

N2  - Tests on effect of insecticides on adults of housefly and German cockroach were carried out by dipping technique. The insecticides employed were as follows : Tech. -DDT. lindane, dieldrin, DDVP, Dibrom, diazinon, ronnel, Baytex, Sumithion, Dipterex, malathion. Adults of housefly and German cockroach were immersed for three minutes in diluted aqueous solution of acetone or ethanol containing a required concentration of each insecticide. Mortality was recorded after 24 hours. Effects of dipping tests were evaluated differently and compared with those of topical application. Effects of DDVP, Dibrom, Dipterex and malathion of dipping were especially lower in comparison with those of topical application. Moreover, the mortality was affected strongly by the susceptibility of insect strain tested. Housefly adults used here showed resistance to organochlorinated insecticides and diazinon of topical application tests and the effectiveness which was commpared with LC_50 of dipping tests was declined in following order : ronnel, Baytex, Dibrom, Sumithion, diazinon, lindane, DDVP, DDT, malathion, dieldrin, Dipterex. German cockroach showed no resistance to insecticides tested (dieldrin, lindane, Baytex, Sumithion, diazinon, ronnel, Dibrom, DDVP, DDT, malathion, Dipterex).

N2  - Since 1964 we have been engaging in checking the development of insecticide resistance in German cockroach, Blattella germanica. Samples of cockroaches were collected from about twenty different places of Japan. The results may be summarized as follows : Females of the field colonies showed less than 50% mortality to dieldrin at 0.25g/m^2 after 7 days' continuous exposure. Even at 2.5g/m^2, several colonies showed only low mortalities not attaining 50%. On topical application test these resistant cockroaches showed (LD)_<50> values against dieldrin after 7 days at least 370 times that of the normal strain. The dieldrin-resistant colonies were also resistant to γ-BHC and chlordane, the (LD)_<50> value being about 20 times the normal for γ-BHC and about 60 times for chlordane. These resistant colonies were found to be still quite susceptible to organophosphorus compounds such as fenitrothion and diazinon.

N2  - During summer and autumn of 1964, a field test of fly control with residual treatments of Baytex and dimethoate was carried out in a poultry ranch of Osaka prefecture. Sixteen species of flies were collected in a poultry ranch (Table 1). The dominant species were Sarcophaga peregrina, Fannia scalaris and Ophyra nigra. Emulsion of Baytex was applied in the southern part of the ranch, and wettable dust of dimethoate in the northern part. 0.5% emulsion or suspension of each insecticide was sprayed on the ceiling and walls, at the rate of 50ml per square meter. These applicalions were made with motor compression sprayer. Population density of each flies was estimated by counting the flies adhering to sticky fly tapes which were located at poultry ranch or dwellings. In the results, the population of flesh flies, Sarcophaga peregrina, was markedly decreased after those applications. The reduction of fly populations was also observed in the neighboring houses, but the effect was not limited to flesh flies. It was supposed that the decrease may be attributable mainly to the effect of residues treated on the poultry ranch, and its effect was given for a month.

The effciency of the new trap and Kato's animal baited trap is compared ; Culex pipiens pallens is not effectively captured by the new trap, whereas C. tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis are captured effectively by the new trap. Aedes vexans nipponii seems to be captured in equal numbers by both traps. The difference of abundance of the mosquito population is recorded in the two kinds of mosquito trap.

N2  - Some fatty acids, their esters, and related alcohols were assayed by a filter paper method for the attractive and feeding stimulative effect on the three species of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, P. fuliginosa, and Blattella germanica. The results suggest that the starved cockroaches are attracted to many kinds of fat soluble substances which include at least above mentioned three groups of compounds. There seems to be optimum ranges of molecular weights for attractiveness in homologous groups of the compounds. The most effective saturated free fatty acids in gathering the insects on the spots treated with them were n-caproic, n-caprylic, n-capric, and lauric acid. Oleic acid, one of unsaturated fatty acids, was also highly attractive. The most effective attractants in esters were methyl myristate, ethyl myristate, methyl palmitate, and ethyl palmitate. Saturated normal alcohols with 8 to 14 carbon atoms were also attractive especially for P. americana, and P. fuliginosa. Oleyl alcohol was especially attractive for B. germanica. A few of the attractive compounds also showed the feeding stimulative effect, but many others were less or not effective in eliciting feeding responses in the three species at a dose level of about 250μg per spot on the paper, despite of their long time exposure to the insects. The most effective feeding stimulants were n-caprylic acid and methyl myristate. Oleyl alcohol was especially stimulative for B. germanica, but not for the others. There observed a few species-specific responses to some compounds, though the lack of specificity of most of the attracting compounds and feeding stimulative ones among the three species was demonstrated.

N2  - Through rearing and several crossing experiments, the author observed ovarian development at 25℃, 20℃ and room temperature of 10℃ average, oviposition and mating activities in autogenous form of Culex pipiens in Japan. When follicles developed normally, inseminated females reached oviposition in 3 to 5 days after emergence at 25℃ ; 5 to 7 days at 20℃ and 14 to 20 days at room temperature. Ovaries of some females, especially of uninseminated females, were often observed to stay at Stage III or earlier when the other normal females attain ovipositing stage. Five per cent sugar solution as diet to adult females was found to have no effect on the period up to oviposition but markedly affected the longevity with this diet, oviposited females showed a low death rate of 4.5% whereas the females given only water showed a high death rate of 90.6% within 3 days after oviposition. Sperms inseminated in receptaculum proved to have an important effect upon oviposition. The oviposition was delayed 1 day or indefinitely in uninseminated females, which showed a tendency to leave eggs in the ovary after they laid such abnormal eggs and each eggs wouldn't stick together like normal rafts. Mating activity in autogenous males rose earlier after emergence than in anautogenous male. One autogenous male emerged a day before was observed to have an ability to copulate with 6 females at 25℃ through 3 days when released with 10 newly emerged females in a cage of twenty centimeters each side. On the contrary only one anautogenous female was copulated by one anautogenous male during ten times of same experiments. Autogenous females also proved to be inseminated by anautogenous male much easier than anautogenous one. When paired in test tube, insemination rate at 20℃, showing 100% through 6 days of pairing, was the highest under the three conditions ; 71% through 5 days at 25℃ and 85% through 14 days at 10℃ average. 91% of copulated males were dead through 25 days after emergence, while uncopulated males showed lower death rate of 32.7% during the same period. When paired as long as oviposition in test tube, the female laid egg-raft with a high fertilisation rate, usually reserving a great deal of sperms in receptaculum. But in such a special case as one male released with 10 females in a cage through 3 days, receptaculum reserved no sperms or the low fertilisation rate of rafts was observed.

N2  - 1. Ecological study on the mosquito Aedes albopictus was made at a cemetery in Amami-Oshima from 1962 to 1963. 2. In summer the larvae and pupae of the mosquito can inhabit every conceivable domestic containers. 3. In summer the density of population of the larvae and pupae is 15.480 (per 100cc water) and the mean number of basins available for the mosquito is 1.112 (per 1m^2). The quantity of water containing in the basins averages 120cc. Thus, the number of adults of the mosquito emerging from the basins in the areas studied is, at least, 12, 000 per day. 4. Most larval sites in winter are flower vase made of bamboo, which stood in the areas not exposed from seasonal wind geographically (Fig.1). Winter density of population is as followas : Dec. (1.108) Jan. (0.228) Feb. (0.052) Mar. (0.008) 5. A discussion was made in relation to the reason why bamboo-stump is suitable for overwinter of the larvae.

N2  - The observations on variations of number of eggs in an egg-sheath, hatching rate and immature period of the roach, Periplaneta japonica, under several environments were carried out and following results were reported in this paper. 1. Number of eggs in an egg-sheath is about 15 both in the colony of female and in the mixed colony of male and female. In the case of even number, eggs are arranged in double line, while number of left side is fewer than right side in the case of uneven number. 2. Thirteen individuals hatched from an egg-sheath of mixed colony (average hatching rate 87%) and 5 from female colony (average hatching rate 30%). 3. Average immature stage of larva from mixed colony was 6 months and only 4 out of 118 individuals needed more than one year. While the one of female colony was 8 months and female matured faster than male. 4. The average longevity of a female reared with a male from mixed colony in a same lot was 137 days and that of female colony was 112 days. And average number of egg-sheath produced by the former was 25, in which 6 were of abnormal sheath, and that of the latter was 14, 8 of which were abnormal ones. The longevity of females one of the reared from egg of female colony was 348 days and no egg-sheath was observed. 5. A generation of the roach is 7 to 8 months and reproduction is taken place even in the winter if temperature rises as higher as in the summer. The increase of roaches may be caused by progress of environment such as better structure of houses and heating apparatus. 6. The longest longevity was observed when the roaches were served with water only and it was longer than the cases neither water nor food was served or food was served only. The resistance of female against starvation was stronger than male. Female lived in 2 weeks and male could live in one week.

N2  - Over 5 years surveys on the food habits of 'Habu', poisonous snake, in nature in the Amami Islands were carried out since September of 1959 and the results were summarized as follows : 1. 927 cases were examined and these animals as food of Habu in nature belong in 43 species, 38 genera and 27 families of whole classes of Vertebrata, i. e. 85.9% of them belonged in Mammal, 6.6% of birds, 4.9% of Reptile, 2.5% of Amphibia and 0.2% of Pisces. 2. 17 species of animals were newly found as the food of Habu. 3. House rats and water rats occupied of 82.5% of whole cases examined and the author believes that the house rat is very important one as the food of Habu. 4. Main food of young snake was cold-blooded animals as Reptile and that of adult was warm-blooded animals, especially house-rats. 5. Rats occupy majority of food all year round but the rate of bird becomes higher in autumn. 6. Territory of Habu varies in wide range from field to around residence area and Habu likes house rats so much that residence area must be dangerous zone of chance of Habu attack. 7. Nocturnal activity of Habu and its activity of climbing tree and invasion to residence were proved by its food habits. 8. Sizes of food vary by size of snake and sometimes its takes same size of food as its own body length. 9. Foods are swallowed from head and also digested from there. 10. New knowledges on taxonomy and ecology of food animals were obtained from these series of surveys.

N2  - Recently, a grain itch caused by mites in autumn became a serious problem in barley storehouses in the central part of Japan. The authors investigated some storehouses in the district of Mito where the most severe itch patients were observed from 1960 to 1965. The mite species found are Pyemotes ventricosus (Newport), Cheletomorpha lepidoptorum (Shaw), Cunaxa sp. and Leiodinychus sp. Among them, P. ventricosus and C. lepidoptorum were the most abundant species on the surface of straw-bags containing barley grain and undoubtedly responsible for the itch. Not only the porters carrying strawbag on their shoulders but also incidental passengers walking through the storehouses were attacked by mites. The symtoms are very similar to that described by Booth & Jones (1952) for a grain itch which burst at Indiana in 1950-1951. The only difference is the shorter incubation time before the appearance of symtoms (6〜8 hours). The main hosts and preys of the two mite species seem to be Lepinotus reticulatus Enderlein, Liposcelis sp., Sitophilus oryzae Linne and some free-living Acari (Leiodinychus sp. etc.). It is interest to note that ungorged females of P. ventricosus occasionally form a mass on the surface of straw-bag, though the meaning of this habit is quite uncertain. This assemblage is observed in the form of an orangecolored spot of 7〜8cm in diameter. Each spot may consist of more than 300, 000 individuals of pyemotids. In the case that the color of the spot is pale-pink, more than a half of mites involved are dead. Is it impossible that the phenomenon is due to their cannibalism?

N2  - Cross-breeding experiments between molestus (autogenous) and pallens (anautogenous) strains of Culex pipiens sensu latu were carried out by using genetic markers Gr (green larva) or Or (orange larva) in colonies established from naturally occurring mutants as the weaus for investigating their copulation habits. 1. In the crosses between Or-females and Ormales plus Gr-males, 13% of the egg rafts produced larvae showing mixture of the two different colour characteristics of Or and Mix, which indicated that their mothers were inseminated by at least two males with different genetic markers. This fact suggests that females of Culex pipiens s. l. can copulate with two or more males and their offspring from the same egg raft may have different fathers. 2. In the crosses of pallens-females with Gr-males plus pallens-males in the same cages or of Gr-females with Gr-males and pallens-males, it was also demonstrated through hatchability of egg rafts and by larval colour characters that pallens or Gr females sometimes copulate with both pallens and Gr males, and can produce mixed larval colonies with different fathers. 3. In the mixed crosses of Gr-females plus pallens-females and Gr-males plus pallens-males, 6.3% of egg rafts deposited by pallens-females were composed of a mixture of eggs inseminated by both pallens and Gr males. 4. In the mixed crossing experiments between males and females or different forms belonging to the same age groups, selection in copulation between the same forms were observed. However, in the mixed crosses of same and different forms copulated with males of different ages, i. e. those emerged one and eight days before, the females were found to more frequently copulate with younger males, irrespective of the form to which this belonged.

N2  - Experiments were carried out to determine the influence of rearing conditions of larva on the development, body size, and autogeny of the autogenous mosquitoes, Culex pipiens molestus. The following quantities of food were available for larvae : 2.5mg 5.0mg, 10.0mg, 20.0mg, and 40.0mg, per larva. Developmental rate of the larvae increased with larger amounts of food. The mean developmental times from first inster larvae to pupae were 13.9 days with 2.5mg food per larva, and 7.4 days with 40.0mg per larva (Fig.1). The pupation rate and emergence rate of mosquitoes showed their maximum percentages at 10.0mg of food per larva (Fig.4). The autogeny rate of each group of the mosquito was recorded by the number of females with fully developed eggs (stage IV) in their ovaries per total number of females dissected. The autogenous character in this strain of the mosquito was found to be more strongly influenced by the genetical background rather than the nutritional conditions. The autogeny rates of series fed 40.0mg and 20.0mg per larva were 100%. These rates of series fed 10.0mg and 5.0mg per larva did not drop below 80%. Only three females emerged among those larva fed the minimum amount of food (2.5mg/larva), but all were autogenous females. Wing length of the adults emerged from the lots reared under different nutritional conditions was measured as an indication of the size of the mosquitoes. The wing lengths of mosquitoes increased in the following order : males<anautogenous femles<autogenous females. In each group, the wing length increased progressively when greater amounts of food were available (Fig.5).

N2  - The authors confirmed that a aquarium fish of South America, guppy (Lebistes reticulatus Peters) has been acclimatized in the sewages of hot spring water of Rendaiji (N34°42′, E138°12′), Asama (N36°15′, E138°00′), Togura-Kamiyamada (N36°29′, E138°05′) and Uchigo (N37°02′, E140°51′) from several years ago. Regular surveys of the guppy populations and the enviromental factors of habitats were mainly made in Togura-Kamiyamada and Rendaiji. Water temperature of the habitats of guppies was maintained about 20℃ even in winter season. These guppies were not cold-resistant. They begin to disperse to irrigation streams, rice fields and shallows of rivers in summer. In one of the winter habitats population density of guppy attained to extreme high level until end of winter, but it remarcably decreased in summer as dispersion of fish proceeded. The guppies showed so rapid growth and so great fecundity that they could fill the summer habitats in shorter time. It can be supposed that guppy is suitable to be used as a predator of mosquito larvae which emerge in rice fields and other smaller water bodies by the reason of its euryphagy and rapid increase in number. In the rice fields of Rendaiji and Togura-Kamiyamada, very little larvae of Anopheles sinensis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus were discovered.

N2  - Investigations were made to find out the cause of inactivation of some organophosphorous insecticides after mixed with polluted water. Fourth instar larvae of the mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, DK strain, were used for test of the effectiveness of the insecticides. Results of experiments to expose the larvae at 28℃ for 24 hours to buffer solutions with various pH values have shown that 50% levels were 11.8 and 2.4 and no deaths were seen between pH 3 and pH 10. Further tests were made on the residual effects of insecticides mixed in buffer solutions with varying pH values from 3 to 10. At the observations made after 16 days, no considerable reduction in the effectiveness was seen for dieldrin, lindane, p-p' DDT, fenthion (Baytex), fenitrothion (Sumithion), parathion and methyl-parathion, while remarkable reductions in effectiveness were seen at all pH levels for ronnel, at alcaline solutions over 7 for dichlorovos (DDVP) and malathion, and at acid solutions below 4 for diazinon. The loss of activity of some insecticides when mixed with polluted water discussed below is therefore considered not due to the direct effect of hydrogen ion concentrations. Experiments were carried out to see the effects of bacterial growth in media containing insecticides. The insecticidal activity of parathion, methylparathion and fenitothion was found to be remerkably reduced or almost completely lost within 4 days when these were mixed into polluted water prepared with a animal food from natural environments or into unsterilized bacterial culture media such as 1.0% peptone solution. The media containing pure culture of Bacillus subtilis was found to cause the same inactivating effects on the insecticides, while the insecticidal activity was kept unchanged when these were mixed after the media had been sterilized. Both fenthion and diazinon were stable under the same condition and no reduction in the effectiveness was seen for a period of 16 days. The above inactivation of some insecticides in polluted waters was found to be due to bacterial decomposition of substances non-toxic or less toxic to the insects. For example, Bacillus subtilis was demonstrated to decompose parathion to amino-parathion, and fenitrothion to amino-fenitrothon or to methylparathion and further to aminomethylparathion. LC 50 levels against C. p. pallens larvae of amino-parathion, amino-methylparathion and amino-fenitrothion were estimated to be 5.37, 60.3 and 115 ppm., respectively. The chemical structures of amino-parathion, amino-methylparathion and amino-fenitrothion are O, O-diethyl O-para-aminophenyl phosphorothioate, and O, O-dimethyl O-(3-methyl-4-aminophenyl) phosphorothioate, respectively.

N2  - A screening method of cockroach repellents was described. A filter paper (Toyo No.2., 10×9.6cm) impregnated with repellent at one prescribed concentration was set into a paper tube (10cm long by 3.0cm in diameter). The paper tubes were placed in a plastic cage (30×23×6cm), and then 50 adults of the German cockroach, Blattela germanica L., were released. Repellency was evaluated from number of the roaches in tube after 24 hours as follows; Repellency (%)={(Number of roaches in untreated tube)-(Number of roaches in treated tube)}×100/(Number of roaches in untreated tube).

N2  - During a period of June and July, 1965, there was a great outbreak of housefly in the dump site, Yumenoshima Island, Tokyo. An enormous number of these flies supposingly moved to shopping districts and became a great annoyance. On topical application, these flies taken from "Yumenoshima" proved to be highly resistant not only to DDT and γ-BHC, but also to organophosphorus insecticides such as malathion and diazinon. On the other hand, they showed only slight crossresistance against the other organophosphorus insecticides, DDVP, Baytex (fenthion) and Sumithion (fenitrothion). The larvae of the same colony were also resistant to malathion, but still susceptible to Baytex, Sumithion and DDVP.

Seven emulsions of insecticides, DDT, lindane, dieldrin, diazinon, DDVP, Baytex and Sumithion were tested through residue contact method using impregnated filter papers in various concentrations. As a result of the experiments, it was confirmed by LC-50 values after 24 hours of treatment that lindane is the most effective restult showing LC-50 value 2.3ppm and the others are successively effective in the following order : DDVP, diazinon, Baytex, Sumithion, dieldrin and DDT. LC-50 value of DDT was 1, 740 times of lindane emulsion.

N2  - In order to investigate the behaviour pattern of feeding of three species of cockroaches, some preliminary experiments were carried out on their responses to olfactory and gustatory stimuli of food origin. The responses of the three species to the constituents of rice bran and some carbohydrates clearly indicate that the chemical basis of their food preference can be classified under four headings; (1) volatile substances which are soluble in n-hexane and act as olfactory attractants, (2) methanol-or water-soluble and (3) n-hexanesoluble substances which act as feeding stimulants, and (4) sugars and related compounds also acting as gustatory feeding stimulants. There is the lack of specificity of some feeding stimulants such as maltose, L-arabinose, sorbitol, fructose and sucrose among the three species. It is likely that there is the lack of specificity of n-hexane soluble releaser substances among them. The effects of galactose and mannitol, however, are somewhat or highly species-specific in the three species, and there are different responses to the acidic fraction A of the n-hexane soluble extract of rice bran between B. germanica and the other two species. There are also different responses to the n-hexane extract S_1 and to the acidic fraction A between the newly hatched nymphs and adults in P. americana.

N2  - 1. Investigation of the altitudinal distribution of flies was made on the Mt. Fuji from 28th to 30th of July, 1964. 2. Eight collecting stations were selected, where flies were gathered with 2 cage traps uaing horse minced flesh as the bait. 3. Collected flies were identified and counted. The results were shown in figures and in a table. 4. Each fly species had its own distributional range, which was determined chiefly by climate, flora and the presence of the breeding place, particularly human dwellings. 5. There were 4 altitudinal zones of fly distribution : (1) 0-500m. (2) 500-1, 500m. (3) 1, 500-2, 500m. (4) Over 2, 500m.

N2  - An investigation of bovine thelaziasis and its vectors was conducted on Miyake Island, Tokyo, during the period of September 16th-23rd, 1963. The results are as follows : 1. Adults of Thelazia species collected from the eyes of the cows were mostly T. rhodesi, and a few specimens of T. skrjabini was also captured. 2. Twelve cows were examined and they were all infected with Thelazia. Some of them were infected with both T. rhodesi and T. skrjabini. 3. The flies found on the cows were mainly Musca convexifrons and Morellia simplicissima. 4. Seventy one males and 1, 310 females of Musca convexifrons were dissected, and 7 females were infected with thelazian larvae. These thelazian larvae were identified as Thelazia rhodesi. Twenty five males and 179 females of Morellia simplicissima were dissected, but no thelazian larvae were found from them. 5. Infection rate showed a direct correlation with ovarial development in M. convexifrons. The highest infection rate was found among the flies with fully developed ovaries. 6. The vectors of Thelazia rhodesi were females of M. convexifrons. The vectors of Thelazia skrjabini were not found in this survey, but females of M. convexifrons were estimated to be the vectors.

N2  - The distribution pattern of the larvae of the predatory mosquito, Culex (Lutzia) vorax in a ditch was analyzed by the index of aggregation (Iδ, Morisita, 1959). The aggregation of the larvae of C. vorax was comprised of two groups with different size. Smaller aggregation was about 10cm in width and the other was dispersing over a range of about 2m including some of the former in it. The larger group was considered to be consisted of the larvae dispersing from one egg raft. The C. vorax population was, therefore, considered to be intermingled with the population of the prey, C. pipiens fatigans, not individually but as a group. Consequently, the heaviest reduction of the prey population was found in the areas where C. vorax is occurring. The larvae dispersed quickly after hatching in the laboratory but ceased to spread after 24 hours when almost all the larvae had attained to the second instar. The distribution pattern, however, was still aggregative after the stabilization. The relationship between the prey population and the quantity of the predation was recognized as Ivlev's (1961) predation curve, fitting the formula r=R(1-e^<ξN>). As for first instar larvae, however, the expected values obtained by this formula hardly fitted to the observed ones. Those values calculated by the following formula, r=R{1-e^<ξ(N-a)>} fitted quite closely to the observation. The asymptote obtained here was lower in the more advanced instar. On the other hand, the first instar larvae had higher predatory efficiency, and fed on more larvae at higher density of prey population and this higher predatory efficiency differed discontinuously from those of the second and later instars. Such a higher predatory efficiency in the first instar seemed to cause the faster growth of the larvae within the instar. This phenomenon was recognized by the growth curve of this species in the formula, Y=5/(1+e^<-0.579(x-1.702)>). The cannibalism of C. vorax was examined experimentally. Four fourth instar larvae of both prey and predator were released into a vial and the reduction of individuals of each species was counted in time sequence. The reduction of the number of the prey larvae always occurred first, but the cannibalism among individuals of the predator larvae did not occur when a certain number of prey larvae was present. This phenomenon seemed to be attributed to the specific behaviour of the predator such as settling and waiting to capture prey even if no prey was present. The settling behaviour of the predators was apparently reducing the chance of the contact among themselves, therefore, the cannibalism did not occur when the prey, which moves more frequently, was present.

N2  - Crossing experiments were carried out between Gr and Ka strains of Culex pipiens s. l. with different genetical characters, the former representing autogenous or molestus-form associated with greencoloured larval mutants, and the latter being anautogenous pallens-form with normally coloured larvae. F_1 eggs obtained by the crossing between Ka-females and Gr-males showed only 1.8% of hatching rate, the rest 53.1% harboured embryos which were matured but unhatched, and 45.1% were unfertilized. The above rates for F_1 eggs of the cross between Gr-females were 0.1%, 36.8%, and 63.1% respectively. The sex ratio of the former cross was roughly 1 : 1 but all the adults recovered by the latter were females. The hatching rate of F_1 hybrids of the former was almost as high as that of the parent colonies. Gr was selected from a colony of molestus n nature and has been established as a homozygous green larval strain. In the former crosses phenotype of F_1 larval were all "green". Larvae of F_2 were composed of 20.6% of green, 19.6% of normal and 60.4% of intermediate. It was estimated from the above results that the green character is polyfactorial in its inheritance. Among the females obtained by the former crosses, the autogeny rate was 6.7% at F_1 and 3.8% at F_2. No correlation was observed between the apearances of larval colour types and the autogeny of the females.

N2  - It is anticipated that the effect of fly-maggots larvicide is influenced by the absolute volume of the used diluent under "the dilution contact method", in which the test insects are exposed to a certain depth of, or a thin layer of, insecticide dilution for 48 hours and mortality counts are made. The relationship between the used volume of lindane emulsion at the various concentrations and the LC-50 value was investigated using last inster larvae of the flesh fly, Boettecherisca peregrina (Rovineau-Desvoidy), in a test cotainer of 9cm diameter and 6cm in height. The volume of the each diluent was 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16ml, respectively. Through this investigation, it was experimentally confirmed that the relationship between the volume of the used diluent and the LC-50 value showed an inverse correlation as a single straight line. In any series of the experiments, 4ml application has given the most stable LC-50 value. The absolute amount of the active ingredient will be expressed as an index which is obtained by the product of the volume of diluent at each dilution and the concentration. Experiments showed that the more the volume of diluent at each dilution was used, the more the mortality was determined even when the index value was constant. It seems to be influenced by the additional drowning effect. On the contrary, in case of the 1ml application the mortality decidedly decreases. An explanation of this phenomenon will be reported elsewhere.

N2  - A series of experiments was made with larvae of Culex pipiens s. l., to determine factors influencing the effects of larvicides under different water conditions. DDVP, diazinon, ronnel, lindane, malathion, Sumithion, Baytex, dieldrin and p, p'-DDT were used as the larvicides. The fourth instar larvae were exposed to various concentrations of the larvicides in water for different periods of time, ranging from 1 minute to 24 hours. The results showed that in order to obtain the same mortalities in one-tenth the exposure time, it was necessary to increase the amount of toxicants about 10 fold. This relationship between exposure and the amount of toxicants was applicable to most of the larvicides tested, with a few exceptions in cases of some concentrations of lindane or dieldrin. Under the stable water conditions effectiveness of the larvicides was reduced by adding organic materials which absorbed the toxicants. However, the addition of either non-absorbable or water-soluble materials such as starch or sugar did not appear to influence the effects of the larvicides. The absorption of the toxicants into the organic materials appeared to contribute to the reduction of the effects. The quantities of the toxicants which were absorbed into the compound were greatest in DDT and dieldrin, with the following descending order : Baytex, Sumithion, ronnel and diazinon. The absorption of DDVP was not evident in all the compounds tested which is free from active carbon. Active carbon absorbed large amounts of the toxicants in comparison with the others. Three grams of the absorptive materials were added to 100ml of water containing 2ppm of the toxicants, and maintained under sterilized condition for 4 days at 25℃. Results were as follows, with the quantity absorbed given in brackets. Filter paper-DDVP (7.5%), -diazinon (9.0%), -Sumithion (26.5%), -Baytex (36.5%) and -DDT (87.5%). Wood chips- DDVP (19.5%), -diazinon (81.0%), -Sumithion (79.5%), -Baytex (86.0%) and -DDT (92.5%). Larval diet (standard laboratory animal pellets) -DDVP (25.5%), -diazion (75.0%), -Sumithion (86.0%), -Baytex (86.0%) and -DDT (96.0%). From the results of this experiment, it has been found that the descending order of the absorption to the materials was as follows : active cabron > larval diet, wood chips > soil > filter paper > talc, kaolinum, bentonite. There was little absorption of most toxicants by starch or diatomaceous earth. Experiments were carried out with the toxicants at dilutions ranging from 0.1 to 100ppm in which either 90% or 30% of the water containing larvae refreshed daily. Baytex produced 100% mortality for 3 to 4 days with 90% water refreshment and for 12 to 14 days at 30% water refreshment. DDT, dieldrin, and lindane produced almost 100% mortalities with 90% water refreshments for periods of 3 to 4 days, 3 to 4 days and 0 to 3 days, respectively. At 30% water refreshments, almost 100% mortalities were obtained for 4 to 14 days, 5 to 14 days, and 7 to 12 days, respectively, for these three toxicants. Under the conditions of 90% daily-water-refreshment, the residual effects of the larvicides DDT and dieldrin, which showed great reduction of the effect by adding the organic materials in the water of unrefreshed conditions, were decreased more rapidly by addition of the same materials into the water. On the other hand, Baytex, Sumithion, diazinon and lindane produced longer residual effects in water which included the materials thanin deionized water. DDVP was as effective in water including the materials as in deionized water. When excessive amounts of toxicant which produced complete death of the larvae were used, the granular form of Baytex was more effective than that of emulsion under the water refreshment. Factors influencing the residual effects of the larvicides, i. e., the aborption of the toxicants into organic materials, and the release of toxicants from the materials into the water were discussed based on the results of these experiments. In addition, the amounts of the toxicants required to obtain practical control of the mosquito larvae were calculated.

N2  - The biological and chemical analysis tests were conducted on adult houseflies to determine the residual effect of 0.3% DDVP oil solution fumigated in a room. The fumigation was done at the rate of 1ml per 1m^3 in the room where a veneer testing board was installed. The room was sealed for one hour after fumigation, and then the testing board was removed for testing. Houseflies of Takatsuki strain were continuously exposed to various surfaces of the board after two hours, three days, and six days of fumigation respectively and the time-knockdown data were observed. The residual deposit of the veneer testing board in two hours after fumigation was the most effective when it was placed at 5m distance from the jet nozzle and so the effect was most excellent when the surface faced vertically to the nozzle and in the descending order of the horizontal surface and parallel surface. The venner board in three days after fumigation showed an insecticidal effect on the surface facing vertically to the jet nozzle as well as on the horizontal surface at a distance of 5m. Even six days after fumigation, the insecticidal effect was confirmed on the surface facing vertically to the nozzle at 5m distance. Whereas the residual effect retained on the veneer board which was installed on the ceiling at 10m distance from the jet nozzle was noticeable for three days. However, the residual effect on the surface of a glass plate placed beside the veneer board was not recognizable. In case of substituting the testing board which was installed vertically to the jet nozzle at 10m distance for other ones, the insecticidal effect varies in the descending order of the painted veneer ≧ plain veneer > fiber board > textured board > polyvinyl chloride plate > mortared board. It is surmised from the above results that the fumigation of 0.3% DDVP oil solution gives to the indoor ceilings and walls the insecticidal deposit sufficient to kill houseflies.

N2  - During July 12 to August 18, 1965, control tests of the diazinon resistant houseflies with Sumithion (fenitrothion) and a mixture of diazinon and isopropyl diazoxon were carried out in Mihara area of Hokota Village, Kashima-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture. While the laboratory test with the topical application method, the fly colony from this area proved to be more than 20 times as strong against diazinon as the normal colony. In three test areas, 0.5% diazinon emulsion, 0.5% Sumithion emulsion and 0.25% diazinon・0.25% isopropyl diazoxon emulsion were treated as residual sprays. In the case of Sumithion and a mixture of diazinon and isopropyl diazoxon, the fly population estimated by ribbon traps decreased considerably, but the effect of diazinon was always unsatisfactory.

N2  - Difference of the locomotion of Trimeresurus flavoviridis was found between facing to man and isolated from man. Facing to man, the snake made striking pose on its position or rapidly escaped meandering its body. On the other hand, the isolated snake, having loosed its striking pose in a certain period of time, started to move slowly and wandered not in the meandering way. The latter locomotion, having hardly been perceived hitherto, was considered to be one of the aspects of the behavior in the natural environment. 2) The advancing speed of Trimeresurus spat wandering locomotion was measured from the time while a part of a snake continuously passed through a distance of 30cm. Little significant difference of the speed was seen among different individuals of the snakes nor among different intensities of illuminations from 2 to 2300 luxes and the average speed was 114.8cm/min. at 20℃. 3) The advancing speed of the snakes which were used in the experiments on the previous day was slower, 70cm/min. at 20℃. in average and above prolongation seems to be caused by being exhausted or tamed. 4) When the snake was placed 136cm. distant from a dark place, it reached there wandering and resting on the way. From the time required for passing this distance, the velocity was measured as a vector speed wholly. The vector velocity, differing at each intensity of illuminations, measured 49.6cm/min., 111.5cm/min. and 138.8cm/min. at 2, 100 and 2000 luxes respectively. The results showed that the snake wandered along a long way round and frequently rested when in the dark place. This locomotion has been thought to be one of the aspects of the behavior in the natural environment and could be seen in laboratory when in the dark and being isolated from man. 5) Persistent time of the striking pose after isolation has been not considered to be influenced by the intensity of illumination. But it seemed to be prolonged when the snake was active and wild. And the duration of the pose could be recognized as a sign of the wildness.

N2  - Although the green bottle fly, Phormia regina belonging family Calliphoridae is well known as a common species in Hokkaido, Japan; the occurrence of the fly in Honshu of Japan is almost unknown but with some exceptions : Only the one male collection from Morioka in Iwate Prefecture by K. Hori (1950), the five male collection from Naoetsu in Niigata Prefecture by Y. Saito (1955), collections of this fly from Tohoku District excluding Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures by R. Kano and S. Shinonaga (1963), and the seventeen males and one female from Kanazawa City by H. Kurahashi (1964). Some weeks after the great earthquake in northwestern Japan which happened on 16 June 1964, and being called 'Niigata-Earthquake', the insecticide-spraying by helicopters against both mosquitoes and flies of medical importance was carried out early in the next month July. In the course of this practice, accidentally it was noticed that the occurrence of a relatively large number of Ph. regina was demonstrated in the fly-collections from Niigata City. In view of the fact, further investigations of fly fauna and particularly of Ph. regina were undertaken in several localities in Niigata Prefecture and compared with the earlier data which had already been obtained by the present authors from the same prefecture during the past several years. The results obtained are as follows : The total number of flies collected from 9 localities (Niigata, Shibata, Maki, Tochio, Nagaoka, Tokamachi, Naoetsu, Ryotsu and Aikawa) during from July to September 1964, were 49, 568 consisting of various genera and species of family Muscidae, Anthomyiidae, Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae. Of totaled 49, 568, 4, 450 (9.0%), and of totaled 41, 008 specimens of Calliphoridae, 4, 450 (10.8%) were the members of Ph. regina respectively. The flies collected from Niigata City only during the same months were 45, 463 in total number, in which 9.7% of the whole flies and 11.7% of the flies of Calliphoridae were occupied by the members of Ph. regina respectively. In Ph. regina, male by female ratio was almost equall (47.1 : 52.9) based on the 2, 862 specimens trapped in Niigata City during the summer months. As to diurnal and seasonal activities of Ph. regina, it was found that this fly was most active at lighter and hotter daytime in summer though actually active from late April through summer to mid-November. In the other hand, the flies collected from Niigata City from April to December 1963, were 8, 954 in total, of which 5, 876 (65.6%) were the flies of Calliphoridae and 0.7% of the same family were Ph. regina. In 1955, the flies collected from 19 localities in Niigata Prefecture during from April to December were 30, 751 in total number and only 5 male specimens of Ph. regina were found in them. On the basis of those yearly observations, it was newly known that recently Ph. regina showed a tendency to increase in population year by year in Niigata Prefecture, Honshu, Japan.

N2  - It has been seemed that housefly (Musca domestica vicina) is generally bred from fresh rearing sources for its larva, and not from rotten sources. Yet, the information about the relation between the state of medium and the breeding of housefly has been quite scarce. In this experiment, and artificial medium for housefly was used and tested to make clear that housefly could be bred from the medium or not. The material of artificial medium was so-called "dry mixed feed for rat and mouse" which includes corn meal, rice-bran, fish meal, dry yeast, soy-bean meal, cod-liver oil, salt and calcium, etc. The medium was treated with the combination of following three factors. Temperature was kept at three grades of temperature 10°, 30°, and 50℃, while lapsed time after the preparation of medium had 1, 3, 5 days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 weeks, and then, the top of the pot with medium was covered by cotton or vinyl cloths which were called "opened or closed condition", respectively. The control medium used the same material of just after the preparation. The breeding of housefly was observed in such treated or untreated media. And then, to know the state of treated media, we have measured total nitrogen by Kjeldhl method, pH by pH meter, and acid value by N/10 NaOH, in the media. The results were summarized as follows : (1) The breeding of housefly varied according to the treated conditions of media. Especially, it was influenced by the temperature conditions. In the case of the media kept at 10℃ with lapsed time from 1 to 8 weeks, the breeding of housefly was similar with the case of control medium. And in the media treated at 30℃ in opened condition, housefly was fairly bred regardless of the lapsed time. Housefly, however, could not be bred on such media that were treated at 30℃ in closed condition and 50℃ in the cases of both opened and closed conditions, regardless of the lapsed time. (2) Total nitrogen, pH and acid value were measured with the treated media and it was seemed that total nitrogen of every treated media showed little difference and it has slightly upward tendency according to the lapsed of time. On the other hand, pH and acid value of the media changed according to the treated condition of media. For example, in cases of 10° or 30℃ in opened condition, they had no great difference, but in the closed condition of 30℃ and in the condition of 50℃, pH of the media decreased and acid value of them increased, as compared with the control medium. (3) The breeding of housefly was seriously affected by the state of treated media, especially, pH and acid value of media. When the state of medium indicated less than 5.5 of pH and more than 100 of acid value, housefly was not bred at all. It is supposed that the limit of breeding of housefly will be approximately around the point where pH is 5.5 and acid value is 100, in the medium.

N2  - An investigation of bovine thelaziasis and its vector was conducted by the authors in Niikappu Pasture, Hokkaido, during the period August, 1962- November, 1963. The results are as follows : 1. The flies found on cows were mainly Musca convexifrons, Morellia simplicissima, Stomoxys calcitrans and a few other species. Of these, M. convexifrons and M. simplicissima gathered around the eyes of cows and licked their tears. 2. Although 3, 923 specimens representing several species of flies were dissected, thelazian larvae were found only in females of M. convexifrons. 3. Thelazian larvae were found in females of M. convexifrons from July to October. The highest percentage of infected M. convexifrons was found in October, although the number of thelazian larvae per individual fly was greatest in September. 4. Females of M. convexifrons were dissected into four parts (proboscis, head, thorax, and abdomen). Each part was examined separately for presence of thelazian larvae. In these examinations, thelazian larvae were found most frequently and in greatest number in the abdomen. The head was second in this respect. 5. Infection rate showed a direct correlation with ovarian development in M. convexifrons. The highest infection rate was found among flies with fully developed ovaries. 6. Thelazian larvae were collected from eyes of cows throughout the year. The infection rate was highest from September to November, and lowest during May and June. 7. All adults of Thelazia collected from eyes of cows were identified as Thelazia rhodesi (Desmarest, 1827).

N2  - The following is presented as the summary of the findings of the present investigations : The probable importance of the common flies in the transmission of bacillary dysentery and diarrheal disorders should still not be underestimated in the not so sanitary areas. Especially the prevalence of Morganella spp. in and on the fly body, some members of which might be the causative agents of summer diarrhea, would be regarded as the presumptive index of sanitary condition of the area under investigation. Therefore, corresponding attention should be directed to fly control.

N2  - Two field surveys were carried out in filariasis endemic areas in order to assess the relationship between ages of mosquitoes and their infection with various stages of developing filarial larvae. One survey was done in Okino Erabu Island, in the southwestern part of this country, where bancroftian filariasis has been endemic with a microfilaraemia rate of about 10% among the inhabitants. Here Culex pipiens fatigans is the only certain vector. Another survey was carried out in Hachijo-Koshima Island, a small islet some 250km south of Tokyo in the Pacific Ocean. This is the only site of malayan filariasis so far known in Japan with a microfilaraemia rate of 19% among inhabitants at the time of our examination, Aedes togoi is the only vector. In both islands female mosquitoes were collected inside houses from 20 to 22 hours nightly by using sucking tubes and were dissected on the following morning. First the ovary was isolated and the physiological age of the individual mosquito was determined by observing the number of relics at pedicel of the ovariole, according to Detinova's method (1962). The whole body was then dissected out and examined for filarial larvae. Among 349 dissected mosquitoes of C. pipiens fatigans, which were caught resting indoor at Okino Erabu Island in May, 1963, 50.7% were nulliparous, 39.70% uniparous, 8.65% biparous and 0.89% triparous. Of these 45.2% were found to have fed. Although 8.8% were infected, the infective rate was 0.29%. It is of interest to note that the infected rate increased with an increase of age of the mosquitoes : i. e., 7.06% were infected among nulliparous, 9.77% among uniparous, 10.34% among biparous and 66.7% among triparous. This naturally follows, since the older mosquitoes have had more opportunities to take infective bloodmeals. The nulliparous mosquitoes also were often found to be infected; however, all larvae were in the early phase of development. And most noteworthy is the fact that the mature infective larvae were found only in the biparous and older mosquitoes. This suggests that the age composition of the population, particularly the relative proportion of biparous and older groups is of prime importance as a factor to be considered in connection with the transmission of the infection to man. The results obtained with Aedes togoi in Hachijo-Koshima Island in August, 1963 showed the same trend as that described above. Among 108 mosquitoes dissected, 43.3% were nulliparous, 46.3% uniparous, 9.3% biparous and 0.93% triparous. Of these, 77.8% had fed, 6.48% were infected, and 1.85% were infective. The rate of infected mosquitoes was 2.13% among nulliparous, 6.0% among uniparous, and 33% among biparous. The infective larvae could be detected only in the biparous mosquitoes. In both areas the rate of infected mosquitoes was higher among those collected from houses where microfilarial carriers dwelt, than among those collected from houses of non-carriers. However, the infective rate was no different among mosquitoes in either carriers' houses or those of non-carrieres. Since the mosquitoes could have moved around for a considerable distance by the time ingested microfilariae reached the mature stage, it is reasonable to find infective mosquitoes in either kind of house. Hence it is recognized that any of the inhabitants of the area were exposed to the same risk of infection in their respective areas. In both endemic areas no significant trends to familial aggregation of infected cases were observed.

N2  - 1. Mutant strains which exhibit "green" (Gr) and "orange" (Or) pigmentations at the 4th instar lavae were isolated from a colony of the autogenous form of the common house mosquito, Culex pipiens molestus. After selective breedings of such mutants for 4 generations, both Gr and Or could be established almost to the true breeding line strains, but the reverse selections for establishing white (Wh) strains which completely lack in such colour characters were rather difficult and the larvae at the generation were still ununiform in their coloration. 2. Crossing experiments were made on both sides with Gr and Or males and females. All the larvae at F1 generation were intermediate (Mix) in colour character. At F2 generation the larval colorations could be classified into Gr, Or, Mix and Ye by the ratios of roughly 12, 18, 67 and 3 percent respectively, in which a new character Ye appeared which could be differentiated by "yellow" coloration of the larvae. The adults reared from Ye were all males. 3. At the crossing between Ye males and Gr females, F1 larvae were all Gr and F2 were separated into the classes by ratios Gr 53%, Or 21% and Ye 26%, while F1 larvae obtained by the cross between Ye males and Or females were all Or and F2 were roughly Or 88% and Ye 12%. All of the adults reared from Ye were also the males, and the percentages of Gr females plus Ye males were always almost equal to that of Or females in all of these experiments. 4. The above genetical characters of Gr and Or are at most polygenetical in nature, and further genetical and biochemical studies need before these larval colour characteristics could fully be elucidated. 5. The above genetical characters were found to be useful markers in many ways in the researches on this species of the mosquito. As an example, the insecticides susceptibility of the non-selected parent colony and the Gr and Or strains were compared with DDT, dieldrin, lindane, fenthion, malathion, ronnel, dichlorvos, diazinon and Sumithion as the test insecticides, there are no significant differences could be detected. There seemed to exist no correlation between the above mentioned larval colour characters and the resistance to those insecticides.

N2  - The differences of residual effectiveness of insecticides applied to different surfaces were studied using DDVP, diazinon, ronnel, lindane, malathion, Sumithion, Baytex, dieldrin and p, p'-DDT. These were applied in ethanol solution to glass plate and filter paper. Their effects were evaluated in laboratory tests using the adult houseflies, Musca domestica vicina, and the house mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens. All the insecticides, except DDVP, applied to the glass plate were more effective than those applied to the filter paper, when the insects were brought into contact within 24 hours after the application. The effect of the more volatile DDVP was reduced rapidly because of the high initial loss of the toxicant on the glass plate; therefore the mortality observed on the glass plate was lower than that observed on the filter paper 8 to 24 hours after the application. In general, it has been found that insecticides having the steeper slopes of the ld-p line produce larger differences of LC_<-50>'s between the glass plate and the filter paper when compared immediately after application. In residual effects highly volatile chemical, for example DDVP, showed higher mortalities on the filter paper in comparison to the glass plate, and the differences of LC_<-50>'s between the latter and the former became greater as time elapsed. Although moderately volatile insecticides such as diazinon, ronnel and lindane, applied to the glass plate gave higher mortalities for a few days, their LC_<-50>'s obtained from 4 to 8 days after the application were almost equal on both types of treated surfaces. After 8 days higher mortalities were observed on the filter paper than on the glass plate, the differences of LC_<-50>'s increasing in accordance with the time elapsed. The effects of residues from insecticides with low volatility, i. e. malathion, Sumithion, Baytex, were higher on the glass plate during most of the 64 days test period, although the differences of LC_<-50>'s were reduced as age of the residues increased. Throughout the entire test period of 64 days, insecticides of low volatility, dieldrin and DDT, showed high mortalities when applied to the glass plate; those effects, or the differences of LC_<-50>'s were almost the same on both surfaces as those obtained initially after the application. In interpreting these experiments, it is considered that the adsorption of solutions containing toxicants on or into the treated surface, the release of toxicants into the air by evaporation, and the translocation of toxicants from treated surface to untreated, were the factors affecting the differences in residual effects of insecticides applied to different surfaces as residual sprayings.

N2  - Experiments were made to estimate the effects of insecticide applications on the population densities of the adults of Culex pipiens fatigans in four areas in Bangkok. The insecticide used was 10% Sumithion emulsion, and the population densities were measured with the box-trap method newly developed for this purpose. In area T where residual sprays to all houses with the ratio of 50ml of 0.5% solution per square meter of the wall surface, the reduction of the mosquito density was seen immediately after the sprays to about 13%, and recovered to about 50% on a month later when the second spray was applied. The population level dropped to about 6% at an observation made 6 weeks after start of the spray. In area W, no residual spray was made but all the breeding places of the larvae were treated by spraying Sumithion emulsion at the rate of 0.1ppm, at weekly intervals. The. reductions in the adult populations were seen only after a few weeks from the start of the treatments, but the effects were remarkable and the populations were kept at levels below 10% so long as the weekly sprays were continued. Simultaneous applications of the adult control by residual house sprays and the larval control by the treatment of breeding places were practiced in area R. The effects naturally appeared from immediately after the start and lasted for all the period under observation. No significant changes were seen in area C where no control measures were applied. Mosquito samples collected by the traps were identified and disected. Almost all specimens were Culex pipiens fatigans, and the always higher in numbers than the females. The ratios of young females (nulliparous and with the ovarial follicles of Stage I) were found to drop remarkably in areas where the larval control measures were practiced. The parous rates of females varied by the collections, and no significant changes were seen even in areas of residual sprays.

N2  - In the summers of 1962 and 1963, field experiments on the repellents to chicken-biting Culicoides species, C. arakawae and C. odibilis which are dominant components of the biting midge populations, were carried out in three poultry farms isolated from each other at the Tama-kyuryo Hill area in Yokohama City. For determination of repellency of three repellent formulations, the flock of chickens of either farm A or B was sprayed with emulsions of the repellents and successive change of the daily biting rates of midges collected by light trap at the treated pens as compared with the rates at the control farm. The spraying schedule on the two farms was changed from treated to control, alternatively. In parallel with the examination of the biting rate, the infection rate of Leucocytozoon caulleryi in a definite flock and the growth rate of both groups were also investigated. Formulation 1, containing N, N'-diethyl mtoluamide 5%, 20% pyrethrins 2.5%, piperonyl butoxide 2%, N-octyl bicylohepten dicarboximide 2%, and di-n-propyl i-cincomeronate 2% as main constituents, was more effective than formulation 2 containing the former compound and butoxy polypropylene glycol. Sprayings of 10-fold diluted emulsion of formulation 1 at the rates of 3-8ml per chick and 25ml per chicken inhibited the biting rates of Culicoides at the level of 90 to 95%. The effective duration of formulation 1 was about 1 week after a single treatment but prolonged to 2 weeks after repeated ones at 3-day intervals. In spite of rather successful protection of chickens from the feeding of biting midges, the infectivity of L. caulleryi to the birds was not lowered in 1962 where high prevalences of both biting midges and disease were shown, but other evidences indicated some possibility for protection of severe infection. The infectivity apparently decreased as a result of sprayings in the experiment of 1963 where the prevalences were comparatively low. In addition, prophylactic effect was observed on a flock treated against fowl pox infection. No adverse effects were noticed in the growth and health of chicks after repeated trials of formulation 1 at 3-day intervals over a period of 1.5 months.

N2  - During the early summer in 1963 an enormous number of mosquitoes had become a tremendous nuisance among the inhabitants in an area of Omiya district, the vicinity of Tokyo. The only one main breeding place was found to be a stagnating irrigation creek running through by the area. The control of mosquito larvae was carried out in the end of May by spraying floating dust of 3 per cent of Baytex on the surface of the creek along about one kilometer of length. Then the complete change on the breeding place was achieved by spilling the water away into rice paddy fields which followed a few days after the insecticide spraying. Observations on the density and the age composition of the adult population were carried out before and after the larval control for the period of one and a half of months. Collection of mosquitos was done in a station located about a half kilometer from the creek using light traps, dry ice-mosquito net traps and inside resting collections in a chiken hut. The population density was observed to show a rapid decrease after the control and by the time of two weeks after the control it reached a minimum, that is, about 10% of the original level before control. Thereafter the population recovered gradually and regained its original size in the beginning of July. The age determinations were done according to the Detinova's method and the number of relics for individual mosquito were recorded. The parous rates individual mosquito were recored. The parous rates indicated 9.3% and 8.3% for the collection by dry ice method and by resting collections respectively before the control. Two weeks after the control they reached up to 91.7% and 57.4% then dropped again to 11.0% and 4.0% respectively in the beginning of July. It is obvious that the changes in the parous rate were reversely correlated with the transition in the density. A fact that a remarkable increase of parous rate was encounterred in two weeks after the control when the depression in the density occurred clearly suggests that the decrease of the population was caused exclusively by the eradication of the larval stage of the mosquito.

N2  - In order to investigate the relationship between calendar age of mosquitoes and physiological age determined by the observations of ovarioles after Detinova (1962) the examinations were carried out at 25°C and 80-90% RH conditions with the colonies of Culex pipiens pallens which have been collected in Tokyo and maintaned in this laboratory. The results showed that by 24 hours after emergence the follicles developed from N stage by Detinova to the stage I by Christophers. The follicles remained to I stage unless the mosquito fed on blood meals, however they continued to grow and the diameter reached to around 80 microns on three days after the emergence then kept almost same size until blood feeding. By three days after emergence over the half number of female mosquitoes took the blood meals and after six days over 90% were observed to finish blood feeding and also mating, which was determined by the presence of sperms in the spermatheca. After engorgement the follicles started to develop; by three days they reached to V stage and the longer diameter grew from around 100 microns up to about 550-600 microns. However the actual ovipositions took place a little later, and it was six days after engorgement that more than half of examined mosquitoes had been found to lay eggs. In twenty four hours after oviposition the saclike dilatations formed at ovariole pedicels completed their contraction and made the relics, therefore a considerable part of mosquitoes which were obtained in the field and found to have one relic per ovariole, that is, determined of one physiological age, could be considered to have elapsed around ten days after emergence. The mosquitoes which finished the oviposition were found to refeed on animals in a remarkablly short period after laying eggs; by 15 hours after oviposition more than half of the mosquitoes were observed to reengorge still having sac-like dilatations in ovaries. Whereas the period required to make the second oviposition could be considered to be almost the same with that in the first gonotrophis cycle, the second egg-laying would occur around 16 to 17 days after the emergence of the mosquito. So the physiological age of two would correspond to around 16-17 days of calendar age in the majority of mosquitoes.

N2  - One year observation on the fluctuation of population density of Culex pipiens pallens was carried out in a large cave and in the chicken houses outside of the cave located in the vicinity of Tokyo, from Feburuary of 1963 to Feburuary of 1964. Physiological age was also determined with each collected specimens in accordance with Detinova's method and seasonal changes of age composition of the population were observed. The data on the density combined with those on age composition facilitated the dynamic analysis of natural population of mosquitoes. Five phases were distinguished concerning to activity of mosquito population on the basis of changes in density and age composition; that is, hibernating phase in winter, reactivated phase in the early spring, first generation in spring, proliferating phase in summer, and pre-hibernating phases in autumn. The parous rate of population which is hibernating in the cave was observed constantly at the level of around six or seven per centage. Although all of the parous mosquitoes of hibernating population were found to have only one relic at ovariolar pedicles, the fact indicated that at least a part of hibernating mosquitoes did take a blood meal before entering into hibernation. This would be of interest pertaining to possibility of overwintering of some arthropod-born viruses by adult females of hibernating mosquitoes. The temporal decrease of population density was observed to take place in the midst of summer season. The slight aging tendency which was concurrently noticed in the age composition of adult population of this season suggests that decrease of number of adults could be resulted from decrease of pipiens larvae by their natural enemy, i. g. the larvae of Culex vorax which is well known to breed in breeding places of pipiens larvae in that season. The developing stage of follicles in ovaries were found all remaining at Christophers's I stage in mosquitoes which were hibernating in the cave, however, the most parts of mosquitoes in active seasons were observed to have the follicles at II or III stage. As the latter specimens of mosquito were collected inside of the chicken houses at around three o'clock in the afternoon, and the majority of them were shown to have blood clot in stomach, it may be natural that the follicles had developed to some extent by that time after engorgement. However as it was reported in the previous paper of this series, the period required for the follicles to develop up to II or III stage would be about 24 hours at 25℃, a fact suggested that mosquitoes remained for a considerable period in chicken houses after taking a blood meal.

N2  - In the previous paper, the author reported on the differences in activities of various enzymes in the body of typroglyphoid mites, and that remarkable differences by the species were seen those which acted on carbohydrates. The present study was intended to see mode of utilizations of various carbohydrates as nutrients by different species of the grain mites as observed from the rates of reproductions in food composed of mixtures of dried yeast and various carbohydrates. Cultures of three species of the grain mites, Tyrophagus dimidiatus, Aleuroglyphus ovatus and Carpoglyphus lactis were made in media composed of the mixtures of dried yeast and carbohydrates (glucose, lactose, sucrose, dextrin and starch) at the ratios of 10 : 0, 8 : 2, 6 : 4, 4 : 6, 2 : 8 and 0 : 10. They were kept in separate containers regulated at relative humidity of 75% in an incubator at 25℃. The densities of mites in the cultures were counted at two weeks intervals. Carpoglyphus was found to breed best in the media containing 40 to 60% glucose or sucrose, while the diets containing dextrine and starch were less adequate as food than dried yeast alone. On the other hand, the rate of reproductions of Aleuroglyphus ovatus was the highest in cultures composed of the mixtures of starch and yeast at about equal ratios. However, the mite was estimated to be unable to utilize glucose and lactose for its reproduction. Tyrophagus was found to be intermediate type in its nutritional requirements between the above two species, and the addition of any of the carbohydrates to the yeast was had the effects to increase its rates of reproductions. The results shown above seem to indicate that Caropoglyphus lactis is the mite that utilize glucose or sucrose as the nutrients but not the starch, while Aleuroglyphus is the reverse in its requirements, and that Tyrophagus has broader allowances and can utilize a variety of carbohydrates from glucose to starch.

N2  - The breeding places and some habits of tabanid flies concerning with their control were investigated in the mountainous regions of Yamagata and Niigata Prefectures in 1964. The results were as follows : 1. The larvae of Tabanus iyoensis, adults of which are prevalent in the mountainous regions, were found beneath decayed leaves lied thick on bushy ground. 2. The larvae of T. sapporoensis were also collected beneath decayed leaves lied on somewhat watery places. 3. Some knowledges concerning with the breeding places of mountainous tabanids such as Chrysozona rufipennis, Tabanus chrysurus, Silvius matsumurai, etc. were also obtained. 4. Most (93%) of the tabanid larvae collected from rice fields were identified with those of Tabanus mandarinus, and others were those of T. takasagoensis, Chrysops van-der-wulpi and an unidentified species. 5. No larvae of bloods sucking tabanids were obtained from sandy soil of river-bank. 6. Tabanid larvae fed on earthworms, Limnodrilus gotoi and Pheretima communissima. 7. Some types of seasonal occurrence were recognized : Chrysops japonicus appeared late in April and vanished early in May, Tabanus fulvimedioides appeared late in June and vanished about the middle of July when many other tabanids began to come out, and Chrysops basalis appeared late in August when the tabanid occurrence declined. Most of tabanids appeared in midsummer, while the occurrence of Chrysops van-der-wulpi and Tabanus amaenus were thought to last long from late in May to the end of August. 8. The tabanids which occurred before the midsummer were thought to appear later and those which occurred after the midsummer earlier in mountains than those on plains, therefore the duration of tabanid occurrence in mountains was observed to be shorter than that on plains. 9. Peaks of occurrence of T. iyoensis, T. mandarinus and T. trigonus were seen at the middle of August. 10. The duration of occurrence of T. iyoensis at the upper stream of Tamagawa River, Yamagata Prefecture, was about a month from late in July to late in August. More than 90% of tabanids collected at their most prevalent period of the middle of August were occupied by T. iyoensis. 11. Most of T. iyoensis were observed to attack cattle and men in the early evening (6.00〜7.00P.m.). 12. T. iyoensis and some other species were observed to be attracted by carbonic acid gas originated from dry ice. 13. Some of T. iyoensis and T. sapporoensis were observed to be attracted by a fluorescent lamp. 14. The cow applied with the repellent (main element : Dimethylphthalate) on body surface was prevented from attack of tabanids.

N2  - During a period from April, 1962, to February, 1963, the prevalence of Culex mosquitoes which breed in the septic tanks for water closet located within the city of Tokyo, Shibuya, Harajuku and Yoyogi, was investigated. Similar observation was made from April 1963 to June 1964 at the same tank of Harajuku. At the septic tank of Shibuya the mosquito was recognized, in 1962, from the beginning of July until December, at Harajuku from the middle of June until January of 1963. During 1963 the mosquito population declined at Harajuku, appearing in late June, disappearing in early December. This is probably due to netting at the opening of disinfection tank. It was demonstrated that in the early season (June-early August) the tank of Shibuya was occupied by Culex pipiens pallens, then, in August, both C. pipiens pallens and C. molestus coexisted, but in September the latter species monopolized and finally the both are mixed again from late October to middle November. At Harajuku the tank was occupied by C. pipiens pallens until late August, which was followed by the mixed population during September but C. molestus remained exclusively later then. Similar phenomenon was seen in 1963, i. e., C. pipiens pallens occupied from July to early September, both species from middle September to early October, then only C. molestus remained. At a septic tank of Yoyogi netting at the exhaust pipe and blocking of manhole crevices, accompanied with insecticide spraying into the second septic tank, completely prevented the mosquito annoyance.

N2  - The autogenous mosquito, Culex molestus, usually invades into septic tanks for water closet and establishes themselves not only in its disinfection tank but even in the second septic tank. A series of the tests was conducted to kill mosquito larvae without interfering decomposing process of microorganisms breeding in the aerobic bed. It was observed that the application of diazinon emulsion in 5ppm, or malathion in 5ppm affects unfavourably to the total population of microorganisms and their balanced composition. On the other hand malathion in 1ppm, Baytex in 0.25ppm did not show any recognizable influence upon microorganisms. A laboratory as well as a field test were conducted in order to check the efficiency of used insecticides. In laboratory tests using, as the diluent, chlorine free tap-water or actual septic-tank water, Baytex (fenthion) and Sumithion (fenitrothion) showed high efficiency to the mosquito larvae which belong a high DDT-resistant strain. In field tests, the mosquito larvae kept in a cage were submerged in septic-tank water. When Baytex or Sumithion, in 0.25ppm respectively, was applied 100% mortality of the caged larvae was recognized after 24 hours. On the other hand, diazinon application has shown 99% mortality in 1ppm, but only 50% in 0.5ppm. Against the adult mosquitoes prevailing in the closed space of a septic tank a 20% DDVP resin strip has given a promising effect.

N2  - A thin-bodied pale brownish cockroach being misidentified as "Phyllodromia vilis auct." (nec Brunner v. W.) has been known to occur in Kyushu and Taiwan. Princis suggested recently the correct name, Onychostylus pallidiolus (Shiraki), of which the specific name was once given by Shiraki but changed by himself misled by Karny (1915). Here is given an illustration of this species based upon a plentyful material taken from many localities on the Pacific coast of south Japan and from the islands of the Ryukyus as well as from Taiwan. This is an arboreal insect dwelling among the leaves of trees. The oothecae are stuck on the leaves and are very flat as compared with that of Blattella germanica. The larvae are extremely flat insects and almost semitransparent, inhabiting always green, or often dead, laeves of shrub trees. Two other species, O. notulatus, and the true O. vilis were also illustrated, the former recently found from some islands of the Ryukyus, and the latter from Iwo-jima (Sulphur Island) in the northwestern Pacific. The biology of these species has not sufficiently be made known although they are supposed to be arboreal as the first species. It may be interesting to note that O. vilis was recorded, in Iwo-jima, as invading human houses. This species is easily bred in a breeding vial under artificial condition similarly to the German cockroach.

N2  - Following the previous report on the comparative study of pleural structures of the thorax of adult mosquitoes in Japan, additional observations were made with 31 species of the mosquitoes collected from Thailand. It was also confirmed that the characters of pleural plates and attached bristles and scales were extremely useful in the taxonomy of the mosquitoes. Taxonomical key characters were described and illustrated for identification and classification of the species, subgenera, genera and tribes of the family Culicidae. The examination of pleural structures by the method reported here is recommended to be more widely used in the entomological surveys, since it is simple and easy to be practiced in the fields, and always reflects phylogenetically important charcters.

N2  - Comparative morphological studies were made in the colonies of Culex pipiens complex collected from localities covering from northern to southern Japan which represented the forms known by the subspecies names of pallens, fatigans and molestus. The colonies examined were the anautogenous forms from Sapporo (Hokkaido, the northmost island), Sendai (northern Honshu), Tokyo (east Honshu), Nagoya (middle Honshu), Kyoto (west Honshu), Sakito (west Kyushu), Kagoshima (south Kyushu) and Koniya (Amami, southmost island), and the autogenous form from Kawasaki near Tokyo. The biometrical values of 100×D/V of male genitalia defined by us as well as of stem-cell index of wing vein were found to become the smaller as the locality of collection moved from northeast towards southwest, and the ratio of occurrence as well as the size of the dark patches on abdominal sternites became the larger from northeast towards southwest. The shape of white basal bands on abdominal tergites also differed in each colonies, and their margins were almost linear in specimens from northern region while those in southern colonies were arched and expanded medially. The ranges of variation of the above biometrical values were always overlapping between the two neighbouring localities, and no clearcut differenciation could be made between pallens and fatigans forms being recognized as different species or subspecies by some previous authors. The autogenous colony from Kawasaki was the only exception from the above rules in that 100×D/V values were larger than those of the northmost colony from Sapporo. Its character of dark patches on abdominal sternites varied from "absent" to "small" as corresponding with some colonies from southwest Honshu, but the shape of the margin of white bands on abdominal tergites was roughly linear like the colonies from north Japan.

N2  - In the present paper the formations of relics at the pedicles of ovarioles after oviposition were clearly shown with the colonies of mosquitoes of Culex pipiens pallens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Aedes togoi and Armigeres subalbatus, which were reared in the laboratory. The adult females of mosquitoes were individually reared in the test tubes so that one may control the times of blood-feeding and oviposition. The observations of the changes in ovaries were made at each gonotrophic cycle. The sac-like dilatations at the pedicles of Culex pipiens pallens were found to complete their contraction in twenty-four hours after expelling the eggs. The maximum number of relics per pedicle was observed exactly correspond to the number of ovipositions of each mosquito. Therefore it was shown that the maximum count of relics per ovariole can be utilized for expressing the physiological age of mosquitoes of above mentioned species of this country. The rate of number of ovarioles which have the maximum number of relics was, however, found to be rather lower than expected. It was around one third of all observable ovarioles at the first gonotrophic cycle, around one tenth at the second and around one twentieth at the third cycle. It was emphasized that the observation should be carefully made not to miss the small number of those ovarioles in order to determine the age of mosquitoes correctly.

N2  - The age determination of mosquitoes was carried out with the following populations, first was Culex pipiens fatigans of indoor collections with insect aspirators at night in May 1963 from each house at a certain village in Okino-Erabu Island, another was Aedes togoi also of night collections in August 1963 at houses in Hachijo-Koshima Island. The mosquitoes were kept alive in small cages until the dissections were done next morning. Out of 333 mosquitoes of Culex pipiens fatigans which were examined about the relic numbers of ovarioles, 174 individual or 52.3% were nulliparous, 127 (38.1%) uniparous, 29 (8.7%) biparous and 3 (0.9%) were found triparous. With Aedes togoi, 48 (44.0%) out of 109 individuals were nulliparous, and 50 (45.9%) uniparous, 10 (9.2%) biparous and 1 (0.9%) triparous were observed. The determinations by tracheoles after Detinova (1949) and by observing of granules according to Colles (196) were conducted in parallel with the examination of relics in each individual of mosquitoes. Either tracheole method or granule method yielded almost the same parous rate as that by relic method. However, in a considerable part of specimens the three methods did not always give a good concordance. It was shown that tracheole method would lead to false positive results particularly in the specimens of which the follicles developed. Because the enlargement of ovaries even of nulliparaous mosquitoes result the unfolding of tracheole ends. In the use of granule method the pigment of ovarian sheath was often a trouble and did mislead to false positive results. In both of two methods other than the relic method the yolk in too much developed follicles, that is, later than the 3rd stage by Christophers' criteria made the observations either of tracheoles or granules extremely difficult. Therefore a large part of materials were left undetermined of age by these method, whereas the relic method was available. Besides the relic method only can determine the number of oviposition and give more informations of physiological age, so other two techniques should be adopted only in auxiliary use, although they have an advantage in the examination of a large number of materials in a day.

N2  - Observations were made on the biting and resting behaviors of Culex pipiens fatigans in Bangkok. Human bait collections were repeated at the intervals of about a month by four technicians asigned to stations inside and outside of a building, and the biting rhythm as well as population density could successfully be observed. The biting activity was found to become highest at about midnight and to take chronological periodicity similar to that of the microfilarial density in the blood stream. The results also reflected the seasonal fluctuations of the mosquito density which considerably dropped in the dry season. All the mosquitoes collected by the human bait method were females with the follicular stage I-b (ovarial follicles undeveloped and midgut unengorged), same as those collected by the dryice traps. The resting behavior was observed by the box-traps set inside the building and by the water-jar trap set outdoors. Both equipments were the favorite daytime resting places for Culex pipiens fatigans, and several hundreds of the mosquito could be collected everyday. The males were always higher in the numbers than the females, and females of all stages of ovarial developments and blood engorgements were found to use the traps as the daytime shelters. All these mosquitoes were found to escape from the traps during a few hours' period from about the sunset, and come back into the traps in a short period in the morning just before or soon after the sunrise. Comparative studies were made on the ovarial developmental stages and parous rates of the females collected from various resting places, such as the above two types of the traps, animal houses, human dwellings and outdoor shelters. Examinations of physiological ages of the females as estimated from the numbers of ovarial follicular relics indicated that the species were relatively short-lived in nature, with the parous rate of about 20% in the average.

N2  - Under natural condition ovarial developments followed by oviposition of a mosquito is usually affected only sucking blood of host animals. In the present study, observations were made to see whether the blood, some of its components served to mosquitoes as liquids soaked in cotton layers might effect in producing the eggs, and such artificial breeding method might be used for maintaining laboratory colony of Culex pipiens form fatigans for which absence of autogeny had been checked for more than 20 generation. In a comparative observation on the efficiency of ingestion of the blood served by different methods, the mosquito was found to engorge either of the three routes, defibrinated bovine whole blood coated with chicken membrane, that soaked in cotton layer in a petri dish, or through biting on a laboratory mouse fixed in wire-screen cage, with the rates to the total mosquitoes of 94.0%, 85.7% and 72.3% respectively. However, the rates of reproduction as calculated by dividing the total numbers of eggs deposited by the number of females tested were 36.8, 37.9 and 98.8, and the above two artificial feeding methods were found to be less than half in the efficiency of reproduction than through natural bite on animals. Results of dissections of mosquitoes which ingested the blood soaked in cotton have shown that it is usually taken into dorsal or ventral diverticles of oesophagus but later transffered into the midgut, and that no peritrophic membrane is formed like after natural bite on animals. Many of the mosquitoes thus fed artificially were found to discharge the blood without fully utilizing it as the nutrient. However, developments of yolk in ovarian follicles as well as production of mature eggs were affected when the blood meal was served repeatedly for several days at least in a part of the mosquitoes tested. Further experiments were made to see which of the blood component was effective to induce maturation of the eggs when fed by the above method. Out of 25 mosquitoes tested for each lot oviposition was seen only in 8 females engorged with bonine whole blood with the average egg number of 80.8, and all of the others fed once by saline suspension of blood corpuscles, serum, purified hemoglobin or sugar solution failed to produce mature eggs. However, in another experiment in which hemoglobin was fed cotinuously for successive days, a part of females which ingested it for more than three times were found to produce small numbers of eggs. A similar experiment was made with hemolysed blood, the rates of the number of the oviposited mosquitoes to the number of the blood ingested mosquitoes were lower than the none hemolysed blood, but were no significant difference in the egg number. The whole blood obtained from chicken, cattle, horse, rabbit and mouse was all effective to induce egg production through the artificial ingestions, and no significant difference were seen in the rate of ingestions as well as the rate of reproductions by blood source. The course of blood digestions in the midgut and the development of ovaries after the artificial ingestion was carefully checked daily following Sella's classification proposed for Anopheles. However, the blood fed by the abnormal route was often discharged from the anus or often caused death of the mosquitoes probably due to an intoxication, thus cousing irregular results. The addition of 1, 000 unit percent of pencilline and 250mg percent of streptomycine to the blood were found to be effective to reduce the mortality and to increase the reproduction rates. In a similar experiment made with an autogenuous colony or molestus-form of Culex pipiens complex, the ingestion of blood or its components did not cause any significant increase in its first batch of autogenous egg production. The more oviposition was not seen in the groupes that did not engorge blood meal after the autogeny, and in this strain of the molestus-form also the average egg number was fewer in artificial feeding than natural bite. Before autogeny, any mosquito of this strain did not bite mouse.

N2  - Laboratory studies on the developments and rearing methods of mosquito larvae, Culex pipiens (L.) were made under various breeding conditions by using mainly 500ml. of beakers being 57(cm)^2 of water suface. Diet used in the experiments was "the diet for experimental animals". The egg rafts laid within 15 hours were used in the experiment. In non-water-conversion condition, no or little numbers of the larvae were generally developed but the numbers of 18 larvae per 1(cm)^2 of the water surface were developed in the beaker providing 30 egg rafts and 6gr. of the diet at time of the egg stage. In most of the cases, three to six individuals of pupae were obtained from the beakers in which equal amounts of the diet were added every days during the larval stages. Eight to fifteen individuals of the larvae per 1(cm)^2 were developed when the diet and water converted every other days with the exception for large amounts of the diet or few numbers of the egg rafts were used. Larger numbers of the larvae were developed in daily-water-conversion as compared with other water-condition. Thirty four individuals of the pupae per 1(cm)^2 were obtained from the beaker that added daily 6gr. of the diet in daily-water-conversion. These results indicated that the conversion of water or procedures to providing the diet are more important factors that influenced larval developments than the amounts of diet or the numbers of the egg rafts provided. The pupating periods were prolonged with the high larval densities or with the few amounts of the diet. From these investigation the rearing method for the large numbers of the larvae by using 500ml. beaker is summarised as follows : Ten numbers of the egg rafts introduce in a beaker and then 0.3gr. of the diet add in 25℃. Afterthere 0 or 0.3gr., 1.5gr., 3gr., 3gr., 3gr., 3gr., 1.5gr. and 0.8gr. of the diet are added at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 days after initiating the breeding. Three hundred ml. of water are usually maintained in the beaker with conversions of water. The conversions of water are made daily without 1 and 2 days after intiating the breeding. The amounts of diet that based on 25℃. are increased under lower temperatures and decreased under higher ones.

N2  - Successive studies on the seasonal prevalence of larvae and pupae of mosquito fauna in a suburban and residental area of Tokyo city were carried out from May 1961. Results of the year 1961 and 1962 were previously published in this journal (Vol. XII, No. 4 and Vol. XV, No. 4). Examined stations and methods were almost followed as described in the previous paper. Total 37, 493 mosquitoes belonging 3 genera, 6 species were collected (Table 1). C. pipiens occupied 98% and A. albopictus 1.2% and other species less than 0.2% of whole collection. C. pipiens was found in all stations except bamboo stumps and had a tendency to become dominant species even in paddy and swampy field, because of spoiling by residental sewage due to imcomplete drainage system in this area (Table 3〜5). The results of three years 1961〜1963 showed species of mosquito except C. pipiens and C. vorax decrease their number yearly; on the contrary C. pipiens increases constantly and C. vorax fluctuates unstably according to unknown factors. It must be described that between observed numbers of C. pipiens and C. vorax exists obviously antagonistic correlation and therefore C. vorax seems to be useful as natural enemy of C. pipiens in this area (Table 2, comparing with same table in previous papers). C. pipiens and C. vorax appear to be important species to investigate in future in various respects in Tokyo city.

N2  - It was already reported in the previous first to fourth reports that the flies emerged out numerously from livestock excreta and that the fly density in dwelling house or livestock barn was considerably effected by the practice of livestock keeping. In this observation, the fly fauna in the farm (of the National Institute of Animal Industry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Chiba city) where dwelling houses and livestock barns, etc. were placed in a limited area, was observed by using fly catch ribbon, in May and in September in 1963. As shown in the disposition of these building on the farm in Figure 1, several kinds of building were distributed on the farm having the scale of about 600 metres from east to west and about 1, 400 metres from south to north. On this farm, 90 dairy cattles, 150 hogs, 70 goats, 1, 500 hens and 200 rabbits were kept and the results of the observation were summarized as follows : 1. Total number of collected flies by this method were 11, 980 individuals in May, and 4, 611 individuals in September. Among the collected flies, the number of Fannia canicularis, Muscina stabulans, Calliphora spp. and other small-sized flies were much more in May than in September, but on the contrary, a number of Musca domestica, Stomoxys calcitrans, Sarcophaga spp. were collected in September. 2. The proportions of the number of flies by collecting place were 73.6% in livestock barn, 15.8% in dwelling house, and 10.6% in office building. 3. Of the collected flies in the livestock barns, the house-fly was mainly collected in the hog shed and hen shed while the stable-fly was collected in goat and cattle sheds. Only, in May the little house-fly and the small-sized flies were remakably collected in the rabbit shed. 4. The main active place of house-fly is seen near their breeding sources. Therefore, much of them were collected in the livestock barn than in the dwelling house or office building. As for the number of house-fly in the dwelling house and office building, it had only a very little relation with the distance from thier breeding source. 5. It was seen that the important factors of invasion of house-fly into the dwelling house were careless consideration on home management and the existence of children in the family, etc.

N2  - A series of experiments were made to see whether the differences in food habits by the species of the grain mites might be associated with the activities of some digestive enzymes. Three species of the grain mites, Carpoglyphus lactis, Aleuroglyphus ovatus and Tyrophagus dimidiatus, were collected from their cultures with the saturated saline floatation method, and were isolated and purified from their culture media by repeated applications of washing and centrifuging in saturated sodium chloride solution. The mite bodies were homogenized in 10 times of 15/M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), centrifuged and the supernatants were tested for the activities of protease, esterase, amylase and saccharase. The protease activity as measured by Folin method was the highest at pH 7, 5 in Carpoglyphus and at 7.0 in Tyrophagus, while that in Aleuroglypus was the highest among the three species in strength and its optimum pH was at around 6. No significant differences were seen in esterase activities by the species. Amylase activity was the highest in Aleuroglphus, about twice as strong as the other two species, and its optimum pH was seen at 5.5 for all the species. Saccharase was the lowest in Aleuroglyphus and was about one fourth of the other two species, and its optimum pH was at about 5.0 for all the species tested.

N2  - Colonies resistant as well as susceptible to DDT were selected from a single laboratory colony of Culex pipienns molestus, and have successfully been established as the laboratory strains genetically fixed for generations. Tests were made on the comparative toxicity of various insecticides against the larvae of the three colonies by the dipping method using ethanol solution of the chemicals roughly following WHO Standard Method. LC 50 values estimated for the resistant colony (R), susceptible colony (S) and the parent colony (P) against p, p'-DDT were 82-100ppm, 0.042ppm and 0.0078-0.012ppm respectively, while that against technical-DDT were 12ppm, 0.0032ppm and 0.00037ppm. The latter was found to be higher in toxicity than p, p'-DDT against both S and R, and the ratio in the toxicity was larger in the susceptible colony than in the resistant. Tests were also made on the susceptibility of R and S colonies against dieldrin, lindane, malathion, fenthion, diazinon, ronnel, sumithion and dichlorvos. The values of LC 50 for these insecticides were roughly on the same levels reported by previous authors using unselected colonies of Culex pipiens complex, and no cross-resistance against these insecticides seemed to have developed in our DDT resistant colony. However, our R colonies were usually twice to three times more tolerant to most insecticides than S colonies, presumably due to the developments of a kind of tolerance rather than of the real resistance. In our tests using S colony as the material, the toxicity of insecticides as estimated from LC 50 values was by the order of tech-DDT, fenthion, dieldrin, p, p'-DDT, sumithson, ronnel, diazinon, dichlorvos, malathion and lindane. It should be pointed out here that DDT is one of the most effective insecticides so long as the susceptible colonies are concarned, though it usually shows much lower toxicity against natural or unselected laboratory colonies due to the resistance more or less developed within the populations.

N2  - In this paper, the authors reported of the fleas collected from bird-nests. Four nests of three species of ground-nesting birds were examined. These host-birds were Emberiza fucata, Saxicola torqata and Emberiza yessoensis and their nests were collected soon after the youngs had left from them at Kirigamine grassland plateau (1600m.), Nagano Prefecture. Many fleas emerged from each nest and they all were identified with Ceratophyllus garei Rothschild, 1902, a common flea on the ground-nesting birds in the northern hemisphere. Some male individuals had variations on the apical membranous processes of the sternum VIII as shown in Figure 1.

N2  - In the present paper, the author describes the feature of development and decrease of insecticide resistance of the larvae of Culex pipiens molestus against p, p'-DDT, dieldrin and diazinon. The test colony, Fukagawa strain, was collected at Tokyo-Sarue lumber yard in 1962. The test larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of insecticides following WHO method. Originally in 1962, the 4th instar larvae, showed a (LC)_<50> value of 17.87 p.p.m. to p, p'-DDT. After being bred free of insecticide for 20 generations, their DDT-resistance lightly decreased. At the 13th generation of continuous DDT-selection the larvae showed only 8-10% mortality to 100p.p.m. DDT. The colony kept under continuous dieldrin-pressure showed a (LC)_<50> value of approximately 10p.p.m. dieldrin. In the test with the 10th generation of the diazinon-exposed colony the larvae showed considerable rise of resistance, the (LC)_<50> being 0.2857p.p.m.

N2  - In order to obtain the fundamental data for the mosquito control operation, successive studies on the seasonal prevalence of larvae and pupae of mosquitoes were carried out during the whole period of 1962 under the almost same conditions as explained in the previous paper 1962. Stations were divided into three groups as follows : AB group : 8 stations, dominant species is Aedes albopictus (Table 3) CD group : 11 stations, dominant species is Culex pipiens (Table 4) E group : 7 stations, dominant species are Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis (Table 5) As a whole, 21, 259 mosquitoes belonging to 3 genera and 6 species were collected (Table 1). C. pipiens occupied 90%, C. vorax occupied 3% of whole collection respectively and other species decreased as compared with the result of the previous paper. Larvae decreased remarkably in number with stages advanced as in the previous paper. C. pipiens decreased considerably from July and on the contrary C. vorax increased in the same period (Table 2). An obvious antagonistic relation has been observed among the above-mentioned two species. Larvae of C. pipiens existed under -3℃〜-6℃ in atmospheric temperature and were observed from April 14 to December 29 in 1962 (Table 4 and 6). C. pipiens was found in all stations except bamboo stumps and other species are going to loose their breeding places in the residential area in Tokyo. C. pipiens is now the most medically important species in suburban area in Tokyo.

N2  - Successful results in preparing chromosome specimens of Culex pipiens complex were obtained by modifying the methods reported for Drosophila and Anopheles. For preparation of the salivary gland chromosomes, 4th instar larvae were dissected in 0.1% solution of sodium oxalate and the glands were isolated from between head and thorax, soaked in freshly prepared fixative for two minutes, stained in 2% orcein solution in the equal amount of the mixture of 85% lactic acid and acetic acid glacial for 3 to 4 minutes, rinsed with the acetic acid and lactic acid mixture, and were squashed under a cover-glass with adequate pressure of a finger. The fixative was prepared by mixing 25 parts of 85% ethanol, 23 parts of 50% acetic acid, one part of 11% formaline and 25 parts of distilled water. Materials of ovaries were prepared by dissecting either 4th instar larvae or pupae at the joint between 6th and 7th abdominal segments, while those used for the study of testes were obtained from pupae since larval testes were immature and too small. Similar techniques as above were applied for the preparation of reproductive organs, but the organs isolated in 0.1% solium oxalate solution were transferred directly into the stain without treating in the fixative.

N2  - Towards making a research of fauna of Acarina on the floors of school buildings during the summer season, a new method was tested. This was done by means of examining the dust collected within vacuum-cleaners by using a mixed solvent (ethyl-ether/chloroform or ethyl-ether/carbon chloride combination). The schools where this new method was tested were : 6 public schools (3 Grade, 2 Junior High, and 1 Senior High) and 3 private girls' schools. The mites collected totalled 6, 766 spp., all belonging to 29 different families (or 20.5 WMI, which means the whole number of mites per one gram of dust). The WMI figure of the mites, as broken down according to schools, is as follows : 66.6-Private Girls' Schools, 7.9-Public (Senior High) School, 4.5-Public (Grade) Schools and 1.9-Public (Junior High) Schools. The numbers of families of the mites are : 23 families in Senior, 20 families in Grade, 19 families in Junior High and 15 families in Private Girls' Schools. The higher the ratio of the number of Acaridiae is, the higher the ratio of the number of active live mites is. The ratio of this particular cohort according to different types of schools is as follows : 98.6% in private Girls', 72.9% in Public Senior High, 47.5% in Grade and 43.1% in Junior High Schools. As for the Oribatids ratio, the above order of schools is reverse. As for Mesostigmatids and Trombidiformids, the orders of schools are as that for the Oribatids ratio, except that Junior High and Grade Schools are reversed. It is considered at this stage of the research that the different floor cleaning methods are contributing factors for the difference in WMI figures and the suborders. It is added that the numbers of mites were the highest for retarded pupils' classrooms and sewing-rooms. No statistic significance of difference was noted in the average WMI among the schools of the same age groups (e.g. among the three Public Grade Schools). The difference was noted, however, between the three grade schools and the two Junior high schools and also between the public and private schools. Both Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes, 1961, and Dermatophagoides scheremetewskyi Bogdanow, 1864 (Epidermotidae), are definitely dominant species on the floors of the school buildings aforementioned. They comprise 89.9% in the Acarina fauna on the floors. It seems that they act as agents for pruritic dermatosis (insect bites) for the reason that there are many reports on the relationship between D. scheremetewskyi and dermatosis. The symptoms of these bites at the above-mentioned schools were seen on the exposed feet and arms of the pupils accompanied by itching red papules each ranging from several millimeters to several ten millimeters in diameter, and no one recognized the agents, although 78% of the pupils in a girls' schools suffered from the bites. This indicates that the agents might have been too small to be visible. Mites other than described heretofore were found as follows : 91 spp. of Cheyletids (1.3%) (percetage of mites total), 87 spp. of Melichares sp. (1.3%), 68 spp. of Acarids (1.0%), 66 spp. of Tetranychids (1.0%), 61 spp. of Hypochthoniids (0.9%), 38 spp. of Glycyphagids (0.6%), 38 spp. of Hypoaspis sp. (0.6%), 33 spp. of Lohmanniids (0.5%), 20 spp. of Tarsonemids (0.3%), 18 spp. of Ornythonyssus bacoti (0.3%), 16 spp. of Pyemotids (0.2%), and others. Meanwhile, as a result of this new testing method, not only the mites but also other arthropods such as Insecta, Araneina, and Cheliferidae were found. Hemiptera, an order of Insecta (larvae of shell worms and jumping plant lice), totalling 120 spp., which was 1.8% of the mites total. 30 spp. of larvae of beetles (0.4%), 21 spp. of book-lice (0.3%) and 16 spp. of thrips (0.2%) were found also. The latest investigation by the Educational Committee of Yokohama shows that 56 out of 216 public schools (26%) have suffered from both rodents and mites. My study has revealed that 118 out of 211 pupils (56%) in these schools showed the symptoms of the aforementioned insect bites. These observations clearly indicate the possibility of not only tropical rat mites and Dermatophagoides spp. but also Acarids, Glycyphagids, Cheyletids, Pyemotids and others being the agnets for these insect bites. It is said that the habitats of the free-living mites extend to almost any place available for animal life. The floors of an average house are offering normal and constant factors aiding the living of mites containing various organic substances for their foods, thus making proper biotopes for certain species, at least for Dermatophagoides although it has never been so considered up to the present. There are many reports on so-called acariasis. Although at this writing its source is considered to be mite-infested foods, we should pay particular attention to the floors of our houses as well. Also, when examining urine and sputum and so on in detecting the cause of acariasis, special caution must be exercised in maintaining to clean the apparatus used.

N2  - 1. Nine species of mosquitoes which commonly attack the human in the endemic area of filariasis in Amami Island, southern Japan, were experimentally tested for the susceptibility against bancroftian filarial worm. The 3rd stage or infective larvae were examined in four species of mosquitoes; Culex pipiens fatigans, C. tritaeniorhynchus, C. bitaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis. Aedes albopictus, Aed. riversi, Aed. vexans and Armigeres subalbatus were non-susceptible and Aed. Japonicus failed to feed on microfilarial carriers. 2. The majority of ingested microfilariae failed to develop in the early phase, even in C. pipiens fatigans which was shown to be the most efficient host, a large number of microfilariae were lost during the first 36 hours after intake. However, during the same period, only a small part around 4.2% of microfilariae could be found in dejectas. This fact suggests that the loss of ingested microfilariae were mainly due to some processes other than dejection out of the mosquitoes. 3. The rate of infected mosquitoes and the rate of infective mosquitoes increased linearly in accordance with microfilarial density of the donor's blood. The regression line of the former is Y=41.654X+48.735 and that of the latter is Y=25.178X+48.735, where Y is the rate and X is the logarithm of microfilarial density. 4. Host efficiency of C. pipiens fatigans was tested at various densities of microfilaraemiae. Host efficiency of An. sinensis at the density of 1.21 Mf/cmm was 0.076 and that of C. tritaeniorhynchus atthe density of 1.32Mf/cmm was 0.010, whereas, those of C. pipiens fatigans at both densities were 0.75 and 0.67 respectively. This fact shows that C. pipiens fatigans is much more efficient as the host of bancroftian filarial worms than the other two species. 5. Mortality of C. pipiens fatigans increased with the increase of the number of larvae ingested, and it was particularly remarkable when the mosquitoes fed on the blood donor having the microfilarial density over 5.0Mf/cmm. For the most part of the mosquitoes, deaths occurred when the larvae reached to the 3rd stage and started to migrate through the body tissues of the mosquitoes. 6. The indices of the experimental infection were calculated after Kartman (1954) with C. pipiens fatigans at various numbers of intake of microfiariae. The highest ndex was obtained around two to three microfilarial intake per mosquito. Therfore, it was shown that the microfilarial carriers with the microfilarial densityof blood appropriate to serve the above mentioned number of microfilariae to mosquitoes are most dangerous as the reservoirs.

N2  - Control tests of the diazinon-resistant house flies with Sumithion and DDVP were carried out during September 25 to October 30, 1964, in Mihara area of Hokota Village, Kashima-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture. In late 1960, it was found that a remarkable diazinon-resistance had developed in the houseflies of this area. As residual sprays 0.5% Sumithion・0.2% DDVP emulsion was treated in three areas, while 0.33% DDVP emulsion was treated in one area. In the case of a mixture of Sumithion and DDVP, the fly population estimated by ribbon traps decreased markedly through the period of the experiment. On the other hand, the effect of whole DDVP emulsion was rather unsatisfactory.

N2  - The experiments on the separation of a dieldrinsusceptible and -resistant colony from a field population of Culex pipiens larvae were conducted using seven populations collected in Japan. The separating methods adopted here were as follows : For the separation of the susceptible colony, the larvae from an egg-raft were reared to 3rd or 4th stage, then some of them were tested by the discriminating dosage, in most cases 0.02ppm. The batch of the larvae some of which showed higher mortality were pooled in a bat and the next generation was obtained. This was repeated for three to seven generations. For the separation of the resistant colony, similar method was adopted using the discriminating dosage of 0.3ppm and the discriminating mortality of over 80% to 100%. The usual method of the selection by the pressure of dieldrin was also adopted for this purpose. After the results, the separation of the susceptible colony succeeded in Koniya and Furuichiba populations, and that of resistant colony in Koniya, Furuichiba, Denken and Kawasaki populations. The ld-p lines of the separated colonies showed straight lines and these were in good accord with the estimated ld-p lines by "ld-p line tests" shown by Suzuki et al. (1964). The trial of re-separation of the separated susceptible colony with the discriminating dosage of 0.004ppm ended in failure which proved that the colony obtained here was the most susceptible colony, and more susceptible colony could not exist. The LC-50 of dieldrin to the susceptible and resistant colony obtained here were 0.004-0.006ppm and 0.5-0.8ppm, respectively.

N2  - In order to know the effects of several organophosphorus insecticides against the last instar maggots of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga peregrina Robineau-Desvoidy, an investigation was carried out in the laboratory. Emulsions of eight insecticides, diazinon, malathion, dichlorvos, ronnel, trichlorfon, naled, fenitrothion and trichlorfon were tested through "the dilution contact method" which applies a thin layer of dilutions of insecticides. An explanation of this method will be published elsewhere. It was confirmed that three insecticides, trichlorfon, fenitrothion and dichlorvos, are most excellent in the (LC)_<50> value, and diazinon comes next, the others are in the following sequence, i. e., trichlorfon, ronnel, naled. Malathion may be applicable but it did not show the lethal effect to the maggots so far as these dilution rates are concerned.

N2  - 1. A colony of the mosquito, Anopheles (Anopheles) sinensis Wiedemann, 1828, has been established and is now in the eighth generation. 2. Adults are housed in a screened 3′×3′×2(1/2)′cage in an insectary in which temperature is maintained at 27℃, and relative humidity is kept at 75%. 3. Sliced apples, sucrose solution (soaked in cotton pads) and a shaved, restrained rabbit are provied for food. In addition, an opportunity to feed on man is given daily. 4. Larvae are reared in aerated tap water in wooden tubs and enamel pans containing algae, Spirogyra quinina, and are fed powdered rabbit liver and powdered, high protein, laboratory rodent chow. 5. Eggs hatch in two or three days. Duration of the larval stage averages 10 days. Average duration of the pupal stage is two days. 6. Controlled light intensity and regulated duration of light and dark periods did not prove significant in establishing the colony. On the other hand, high relative humidity proved essential for maintenance of engorgement and oviposition rates and lowering the daily death rate. 7. Chief factor limiting colony size was reluctance of females to feed on rabbits and other laboratory animals. The present daily engorgement rate of about 10% of available females was achieved by rubbing human perspiration on the shaved back of the rabbit placed in the adult cage nightly.

N2  - For the purpose to know the differences of shape or size of the egg and sexual behaviors by the living condition of the cockroach, Periplaneta japonica, the females were separated in two groups, one group contained females only and another group contained both sexes. The results obtained by the observations on these two groups, Group A the former one and Group B the latter one, were as follows : 1. Prematuration period was about 11 days in these two groups. 2. Period of egg stage in the egg sheath of A was about 32 days and two days longer than B's under the temperature of 22.2 to 29.9℃. 3. Interval of ovulation of A was 6 days and also two days longer than B's under the condition of 23.1 to 29.1℃. 4. Average number of eggs ovulated by A was a half of those of B but no difference of the size of egg sheath was observed. 5. More number of abnormal shape of egg sheath were observed in A and these egg sheath only were eaten by the roaches.

N2  - This investigation was carried out in order to examine the relation of fly and its parasitic Hymenoptera for the purpose of practising fly contol operation at the rural districts of Tokyo. 1. Overwintering pupae of 18, 555 in number were collected in Ohme city and Chofu city, of which 9, 464 (51%) seemed to be replete by outside inspection. (Table 1) 2. These replete pupae were applied to observe the emergence of any insects from them. Flies of 3, 280 (33% to 9, 464) and 1, 998 (21%) parasitic Hymenoptera appeared. Ratio of fly to Hymenoptera was quite diverse by districts. (Table 2) 4. Of Sarcophagid flies occupied 82.7% and Calliphorid 8.6%. Of hymenopterous parasites Aphaereta sp. (2) occupied 33.7%, Brachymeria fonscolombei 30.7%, Exolytus laevigatus G. 19.7% and other species under 10%. (Table 3) 5. It is interesting that Aphaereta sp. (2) coincided with Sarcophagid in period of emergence and this parasite seems to be effective on fly control in Sawai and Minami-kosogi. (Table 2, 3) There found two types of Aphaereta (2) and of Trichopria commoda in the period of emergence. (Table 3) 6. Nakata's idea to cover the vessel containing fly pupae with a net of such mesh as Hymenoptera passable and not of flies is recommended instead of burning up the digged pupae usually practised in Japan as one of fly control measures.

N2  - To determine the preference of ovposition of Culex pipiens (L.) to water containing larval food or other materials, a series of experiments were made using about 200 of the gravid femals housed in a cage of size of 30×30×30cm. Four jars, 6cm. In height and 9cm. In diameter, containing 200cc of water and the foods were placed in four corners of the cage, or, six beaker, 5.5cm. in height and 4cm. In diameter, containing 50cc of the test solutions were introduced in places except four corners and center of the cage. After 15 hours the numbers of egg-rafts laid in each jar or beaker were counted. The foods used in these experiments were 6 of proteins i. E. leucosin, egg albumin, casein, glutenin, zein or gliadin, 1 of peptide : pepton, 9 of amino acides : alanine, histidine, proline, lysine, tyrosine, valine, glutamic acid, asparagine or cysteine, 6 of carbohydrates : starch of white potato, starch of sweet potato, cornstarch, glucose, sugar or lactose, and others : the food for experimental animals, ebios, ethanol, urea, sodium chloride, NaOH, anmonia, acetic anhydride or HCl. Although some fluctuations observed in these results, the orders of the materials exhibit attractiveness for the female's oviposition were as follows : 0.1% of the materials added to water; Leucosin, Egg albumin>Casein, The animal food>Glutenin, Zein, Pepton, Alanine>Histidine, Proline>Tyrosin, Lysine>Valine, Glutamic acid, Asparagine>Cysteine, Starch of sweet potato, Starch of white potato, Cornstarch, Glucose, Sugar, Lactose, NaCl, Water (the following materials showed repellency for the female's oviposition)>Soybean oil, Ethanol>Acetic anhydride, Anmonia. 0.3% of the materials added to water; Cornstarch, Egg albumin, Leucosin>Pepton, The animal food>Glutenin, Casein>Zein, Glutamic acid, Glucose, Sugar, Lactose, Water, Starch of white potato, Starch of sweet potato (the following materials showed reppellency)>Gliadin>Soybean oil, NaCl, Ethanol, Acetic anhydride, Anmonia. Other experiments using 3rd instar larvae of Culex pipiens were carried out to determine the nutritious effects of the diets to the larvae. The weights of larvae that fed on foods for 1 day were measured and compared with each other. The orders of foods that produced large body weights of the larvae were as follows; 0.3% of the foods; The animal food>Leucosin, Egg albumin>Glutenin>Pepton, Casein>Zein, Starch of white potato, Cornstarch, Glucose>Sugar, Glutamic acid, Gliadin, Starch of sweet potato, Lactose, Water, Urea, Ethanol (the following materials showed larval mortalities)>NaCl>Soybean oil>NaOH>Anmonia>Acetic anhydride>HCl. 1% of the foods; The animal food, Leucosin>Egg albumin, Glutenin>Casein, Zein>Pepton>Glutamic acid>Starch of white potato>Cornstarch>Glucose, Sugar, Lactose, Starch of sweet potato, Water (the following materials showed larval mortalities)>Gliadin, Urea, Ethanol>NaCl>Soybean oil>NaOH>Anmonia>Acetic anhydride, HCl.

N2  - Analytical studies on dieldrin resistance in field populations of larvae of Culex pipiens were done adopting two test methods. One is the so-called "ld-p line test". If a field population consisted of two or three component populations being homogeneous in susceptibility or resistance to a insecticide, and if each ld-p line (log dosage-probit mortality regression line) were separated independently, the ld-p line, or more correctly the curve, obtained from the mixed population would show one or two plateaus, flat portion parallel to the horizontal axis (see Fig.1 and Fig.2). Analyzing the position of the plateaus experimentally get from the curve, the genetical configuration of the mixed population and the component ld-p lines, such as RR, RS, SS can be estimated. By analyzing 10 field populations of C. pipiens larvae, the configuration ratios of RR (homozygous resistants), RS (heterozygous hybrids) and SS (homozygous susceptibles) to dieldrin was estimated, which were shown in Fig.3 and summarized in Fig.4 and Table 2. The other method is the so-called "discriminating test", the outline of which is as follows : Egg rafts collected from breeding sources in field were reared to 3rd or 4th stage larvae in separate bowls. Thirty (pallens type and fatigans type) or fifteen (molestus type) larvae were tested with two discriminating dosages, i. e., 0.02ppm and 0.3ppm (0.1ppm in Koniya population) of dieldrin. With 0.3ppm (0.1ppm in Koniya population), almost all of RR may be alive and all of RS and SS may be dead, and with 0.02ppm, almost all of SS may be dead and all of RS and RR may be alive. So, the rafts consisted of only RR and of only SS can be discriminated from those consisted of two or three components. In these cases, the rafts consisted of only RR may be produced from RR(P)×RR(P); and those of only SS from SS(P)×SS(P). If the frequency of RR and SS factor in P was supposed to be a and c, respectively, the appearance ratio of RR and SS rafts to all the egg rafts was admitted to be a^2 and c^2, respectively. As a^2 and c^2 can be available experimentally by the discriminating test mentioned above, a, b and c can be calculated (in this case, b=1-a-c), and RR(F_1), RS(F_1) and SS(F_1) can be calculated by the formula shown in Table 3. The configuration ratios of RR, RS and SS components in five field populations estimated by the discriminating test were listed in Table 4. In Table 5, the configuration ratios estimated by ld-p line test and by discriminating test were listed. Those methods estimated by two different tests were in good accord with each other. Summarizing the data mentioned above, it appeared surely that dieldrin resistance in larvae of Culex pipiens showed a monofactorial mode of inheritance, with the resistant factor partially dominant. This was confirmed by the crossing experiments with susceptibles and resistants, which will be reported in the other paper.

N2  - DDT-susceptible and -resistant colonies were separated from a population of Culex pipiens molestus, namely Kawasaki population. The separating methods were as follows : Egg rafts were set in separate bowls. After rearing to 3rd or 4th stage 15 larvae were brought into the dipping test of DDT. The larvae from the egg rafts which showed higher mortality or lower one were pooled respectively to each batch. In the following generation, this method was repeated with higher discriminating dosage in the course separating resistant colony and with lower dosage in the course separating susceptible colony. After 3-4 generations, the susceptibles were colonized without exceeding more susceptible, which showed the LC-50 of 0.01-0.012ppm. The resistant colonies selected both by the separation method mentioned above and by the normal selection method under the pressure of the chemical, showed the mortality of 40% with 100ppm of DDT, though this might not be admitted to be genetical homozygous resistant colonies. The hybrids obtained by crossing resistant one and susceptible one were the intermediate of the parents, being more close to the resistant one than to the susceptible one.

N2  - Effects of synergists to pyrethrins, and the mixtures of pyrethrins and lindane were evaluated, using houseflies with topical application method. The relative potency of synergists to pyrethrins was as follows : piperonyl butoxide, 11.06; sulfoxide, 9.62; S-421, 2.61; cynethrin, 1.07. In the mixtures of pyrethrins and lindane, the synergistic effects of piperonyl butoxide and sulfoxide increased in proportion to pyrethrins content, and effect of S-421 was influenced with neither pyrethrins nor lindane. Effect of cynethrin was of slight degree.

N2  - Seven per cent of dimethoate is soluble in water at 80℃. It is possible that the absorption and toxicity of dimethoate in insects are more influenced by the higher atomospheric humidity than by the lower atomospheric humidity. It is also thinkable that oil added to solvent is useful to maintain insects in wet condition. A 2^3 factorial experiment on alternative storage conditions concerning the atomospheric humidity for insects before and after treatment and the adjuvant effect of soy bean oil to solvent in topical application was designed to test the toxicity of dimethoate against the common house fly, Musca domestica vicina Macquardt. The house flies were stored at either 70 or 100% relative humidity for 24 hours before treatment, and also at either 100 or 70% relative humidity for 24 hours after treatment. Soy bean oil was used as a 2 per cent (v/v) solution in acetone. The experimental data obtained (Table 1) were analysed by the method described by Finney (1952). As is seen in the estimated relative dosage values (Table 6) or relative potencies (Table 7), the effect of atomospheric humidity after treatment was the highest among the factors concerning to the absorption and toxicity of dimethoate against the house fly, and the adjuvant effect of soy bean oil was not significant.

N2  - The autogenous type of Culex pipiens, so-called Culex pipiens molestus, has recently been an important nuisance pest in urban districts of Japan. The authors made a study on the breeding sources of the mosquito and their control method in Kawasaki city. The mosquitoes were found in 45.5% of septic tanks and in 50% of underground sewage tanks. Their control was successful by the application of 1ppm of diazinon emulsion or of Baytex granules.

N2  - In summar of 1963, three organophosphorus insecticides, i.e., Nankor (Ronnel), Sumithion and Dipterex, were tested against natural population of non-biting stable flies, Muscina stabulans Fallen, breeding in manure under poultry cages in Saitama area. All applications were made with mortor compression sprayer at 500ml of emulsive dilution containing 0.05% of each insecticides per one square meter, and the treatments were repeated every two weeks. Fly population was evaluated by collecting the flies with paper or ribbon traps which were located at poultry farm or dwellings. All the insecticides gave good control of the stable flies breeding in poultry manure after the second treatment. After the third spraying, however, population of house fly, Musca domestica vicina Macquart, was markedly increased with the depression of the stable fly, although the house fly larvae did not breed in the chiken manure treated with the insecticides.

N2  - The fly fauna was surveyed in the four farms of Tokyo keeping a large number of swine in May and September 1963. Flies were collected using fly catch ribbons in the same manner as the explained in former report. The observations were summarized as follows : 1) The total of collected flies amounted to 48, 254 individuals and they consist of Musca domestica, Fannia canicularis, Muscina stabulans, Stomoxys calcitrans, Calliphoridae spp., Sarcophagidae spp., and the other small-sized flies including of Drosophilidae, Psychodidae, etc. Among them, small-sized flies were ranked first, amounting to 36, 463 individuals (75.5% in total), followed by Musca domestica of 5, 686 individuals (11.8%), Fannia canicularis of 3, 813 individuals (7.9%), Muscina stabulans of 977 individuals (2.0%) and others. 2) As described in the former report, Musca domestica, Fannia canicularis and Muscina stabulans were widely observed on the inside of dwelling houses; on the other hand, Stomoxys calcitrans and small-sized flies predominated outside of the dwellings. Musca domestica were also collected considerably on the outside of dwellings, whenever the favorite diets for adult Musca domestica were available. In the case of Japanese style farm houses (opening planned houses), the number of flies in the dwellings tended to increase than that of flies in the closing planned houses. 3) It is highly likely that the number of flies in the farm in which they heap up or throw away the swine excreta and their feeds around the dwellings are numerously than that of the farm to good raising of swine. Through these observations, it was deemed that the number of flies in the such farm would be sharply decreased, if the several improvements of technical know-how for swine raising and sanitary consideration in the farm were completely practised.

N2  - To know the comparative attractiveness of black light and white or blue ones to biting midges and mosquitoes, a light trapping was carried out during July to September, 1963, at a poultry house in the Shizuoka Prefectural Chicken Breeding Station. Black light always attracted more numbers of biting midges and mosquitoes, especially Culicoides arakawae, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, and Anopheles hyrcanus comparing with white or blue light, but the ratios of the attractiveness considerably varied with species and sex of the insects or days collected.

N2  - 1) Field experiments on the insecticidal effects of 5% Nankor emulsion on larvae of mosquitoes, Culex pipiens pallens, Aedes albopictus, Aedes japonicus and Aedes togoi, in ditches and reservoirs were carried out in Kyoto City, in August, 1963. 2) By the application of 5% Nankor emulsion to the ditches at the rate of 16.67ppm of active ingredient to the whole water, all larvae and most of pupae disappeared after one day. Reapperrance of larvae occured after 16-25 days. 3) By the application of 5% Nankor emulsion to the reservoirs at the rate of 16.67ppm of active ingredient to volume of water, all larvae and most of pupae disappeared after one day. Effective period was more than 25 days, being longer than that in the ditches.

N2  - Covering from the southernmost area of Kyushu and whole the Ryukyu islands there is found a wild cockroach, Blattella lituricollis (Walker) which is sometimes mistaken as the German cockroach. So far verified by myself the distribution of this insect ranges : South Kyushu (Cape Sata, Satsuma Peninsula), Tanegashima, Yakushima, Nakanoshima, Akusekisima, Amamioshima, Okino-erabujima, Tokunoshima, Okinawa (Honto), Miyakojima, Ishigakijima, Iriomotejima, Yonagunijima, Iwojima (Sulfur Islands) and Taiwan. Blattella lituricollis was first described from Amoy, then it has been recorded from South and Central China (Fukien, Szechuan), Taiwan, Philippines, Hawaii Islands, Burma (Bl. bisignata), Greater Sunda Islands, Lesser Sunda Islands. Princis (1957) revised these local materials and recognized the following subspecies : A. Blattella lituricollis lituricollis (Walker, 1868) China (Amoy, Fukien, Szechuan), Taiwan, Philippines, Hawaii Islands. B. Blattella lituricollis bisignata (B. v. W., 1893) Burma (Bhamo, Mytkina), India (Madras)? Seychelles? C. Blattella lituricollis sundaica Princis, 1957 Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Nias, Engano. D. Blattella lituricollis meridionalis Princis, 1957 Sumba Islands, Timol, Celebes? The Japanese and Ryukyu materials fall within the category of the nominate subspecies. They are found, throughout the year, on the ground surface rather gregariously, hiding themselves under debris on the coastal and cultivated lands, often abundant around human houses, and supposed to invade the kitchens in tropical countries. In our insectarium, kept under 29℃, a life cycle needs about two months. While examining a series of the specimens of supposed lituricollis from Thailand I found there are two different forms, one is quite identical with the typical lituricollis (Fig. 15, 16) while the other slightly larger in size being the wing length 11 mm, and is, in the males, clearly different in abdominal and genital features (Fig. 17, 18, 19). The character of the subgenital plate rather allies to that of Bl. lituricollis bisignata rearranged by Princis (1957). As the wing length of "bisignata" was given as 11mm by Br. von Wattenwyl and from the adjacency of the locality of his "bisignata" I am now inclined to think that the larger form from Thailand represents an independent species which might bear the specific name, Blattella bisignata Brunner von Wattenwyl."

N2  - It was already reported that flies tend to emerge out from any animal fecal materials. In this investigation, the fly fauna at the inside and outside of dwelling houses was observed, using fly catch ribbons, from May 1962 to April 1963. The data was collected from eight farms keeping a few live-stocks and two non-farms in Hino-machi, Tokyo. The results were summarized as follows : Thirty-two families of flies consisting of Muscidae, Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae and others, were observed during the period of observation. The total of the flies was 49, 176 individuals, of these Muscid flies were ranked first, amounting to 14, 446 individuals. The majority of the fly species showed the peak of the prevalence at early summer, from June to July. Only Musca domestica showed two peaks, viz., May and December. A considerable difference of fly number was observed depending on the collecting site. In general, inside the dwelling houses Musca domestica and Fannia canicularis were abandant, while outside the dwellings Stomoxys calcitrans, Sciarids, Milichiids, Scatopsids and the other small-sized flies were frequent. There was a wide difference of the number of flies collected inside each dwelling houses. A large number of flies were collected naturally in the farms keeping live-stock, as well as an ordinary non-farming house, if it was located adjacent to a live-stock barn or a manure shed.

N2  - 1) Four families, 34 genera and 65 species of these medically important flies were identified from the many fly specimens collected by various entomologists on the Ryukyu Islands. 2) Medically important flies were collected by K. Aniya four times a month in Ishigaki City from March 1957 to February 1958. 3) In the surveys conducted by K. Aniya, 4 families, 13 genera, 20 species (numbering 17, 380 flies) were collected in Ishigaki City. 4) Chrysomya megacephala was trapped in the largest number. Musca domestica vicina was second largest in number. 5) The seasonal fluctuation of all flies collected showed peak population in spring and a small peak in the fall. 6) In the raw fish trap, many more females of calliphorid flies were trapped than males. 7) Musca domestica vicina, M. sorbens, Chrysomya megacephala, Hemipyrellia ligurriens and Boettcherisca peregrina are particularly noxious in this area.

N2  - Bean bugs are well known as a harmful insect from an agricultural view point. Recently one of the bugs Halyomorpha picus, however, has been found to give a bad influence upon persons living in mountain areas of Tohoku districts in Japan, because of the adult invasion into house under their densely populated condition owing to their hibernation habit in autumn and of the nasty smell resulting from their odor gland fluid on that occasion. During late June to late November 1963, prior to the insecticidal experiments in laboratory and field, survey of H. picus including other common bean bugs occurring on mountain plants had been carried out and these observations led to the following results : 1) H. picus was found living on mountain plants such as malberry, paper malberry, valley deutzia, raspberry and paulownia, etc. Egg masses, each larval stage and adults were collected on these plants during from latter part of June to August. 2) Besides H. picus, some other bean bugs Menida violacea, Plautia stali, Carbula humerigera, Eusarcoris parvus, Elasmucha putoni and Acanthosoma forficula, were also collected on the above-indicated plants and some others. 3) Adults of H. picus capable of oviposition were attracted by light traps in hot summer, in which a large number of them were collected from basin water applied directly under the lamp. They, however, were hardly collected from there in autumn. 4) It was noticed from the rearing in our laboratory that an adult female of H. picus usually laid 28 milky white-colored eggs at a time in the form of an egg mass and further successive few time ovipositions were seen at intervals of about 7 days. 5) About 40 days were necessary to finish their development from eggs through 5 larval stages to adults in hot summer, and at least 2 months being required during late summer to autumn. 6) Various insecticides used were all effective upon the adult H. picus, one of which Sumithion showed a most excellent insecticidal activity. 7) DDVP (0.3% kerosene solution) and Sumithion (1.5% powder) were practically used in the field control and the satisfactory results being obtained.

N2  - Experiments were carried out to observe the mode of breedings of two species of the acaroid mites (Tyrophagus dimidiatus and Carpoglyphus lactis) under the constant temperature of 25℃, the different conditions of nutrition and humidity. The mites were bred in the food of the mixtures of white sugar and dried yeast by the ratios of 0 : 10, 2 : 8, 4 : 6, 6 : 4, 8 : 2 and 10 : 0, and under the humidity of 64%, 75% or 85% R. H. as regulated by saturated salt solutions. 1) Results of pure cultures of each species : Carpoglyphus was found to breed best in the mixture of sugar and yeast at the ratio of 4 : 6, and its rate of breedings was higher under 85% R. H. than under 75% R. H. in the foods of the yeast content of 60% or more. The velocity of breedings of Tyrophagus was faster as the ratio of sugar in food became lower, and the maximum density was observed in pure dried yeast at the humidity of 75% R. H. 2) Results of mixed cultures of the two species : Observations were made to see which of the two species breeds predominantly under the different food and humidity conditions. Mixed cultures of the two species were prepared with inseminations of the materials containing Carpoglyphus and Tyrophagus at the ratios of 82.2 : 17.8, 53.6 : 46.3 and 17.7 : 82.3 to the containers with the varying food mixtures and under the different humidity conditions same as in the above experiments for individual species. As the results, it was demonstrated that the nature of food was the essential factor to determine which of the two species bred predominantly, since the population density of Carpoglyphus was always higher in the mixtures of yeast at ratios from 0% to 60% while Tyrophagus was shown to predominate Carpoglyphus in pure dried yeast only, and the ratios of the two species were almost the same in the food composed of 20% sugar and 80% yeast.

N2  - The influences of relative humidity and temperature, as the important factors on the effect of insecticides to the housefly, was studied by contact test on filter paper and topical application test. The influence of relative humidity toward knockdown effect of residues was largest in DDVP and larger in Dibrom and Dipterex. On the contrary, it is smaller in diazinon, Nankor and Sumithion, and smallest in Baytex. On the variation of effect to DDVP residue, relative humidity was the higher the sooner the peak of the increase appeared and in the case of the lower, the sooner the decrese appeared. The effects on the residues if they are replaced knockdown effect with equivalent dosage, changed from eight-fold to one sixteenth in DDVP, in Dibrom from about four-fold to one eighth and in diazinon from about four-fold to one fourth. It was supposed, that the variation of knockdown effect of insecticides was influenced with moisture of filter paper and nature of each insecticide. The variation influenced with temperature of knockdown effect on diazinon residue was very strong. The effect of DDVP to housefly by topical application test was scarcely influenced with relative humidity and temperature ranging from 25℃ to 30℃.

N2  - In 1963, Dimetilan bait was evaluated against house fly population in rural districts of Saitama prefecture. The baits impregnated with 100mg of Dimetilan (2-dimethylcarbamyl-3-methylpyrozolyl-5-dimethyl carbamate) were set in dinning room or kitchen of each dwellings. Population density of house fly was estimated by the paper or ribbon traps. The results are summarized as follows : The application of one bait for each dwellings did not give satisfactory control effect to house flies. If three or five baits were set in a house, more effective fly control was given for a month or more. The most promising result was obtained by combining larvicidal treatment and three baits for each dwellings.

N2  - In laboratory tests of mosquito larvicides, the effects of density of larval population to the mortality were studied using Culex pipiens. As the density increased, the mortality seemed to decrease remarkably in dieldrin, considerably in p, p'-DDT, ronnel, Baytex, slightly in technical DDT, lindane, malathion, and scarcely to decrease in diazinon. It was also proved that though the density of larval population was regulated to be the same, the mortality decreased slightly, when the environment was considerably larger. After the end of 24 hours-tests, the test water was further brought into the new larval tests, for estimating the residual amount of dieldrin. As the results, the authors were led to the conclusion that a larva spent about 0.006ppm of dieldrin per individual during 24 hours.

N2  - It has been already anticipated that the minute moisture contents within a treated material supported the blooming of the impregnated insecticide. In order to demonstrated this supposition, eight sheets of piled filter papers were used as a model of absorptive surface placed on DDVP residue. House flies were made contact with each sheet of these papers which, in a pile, have been exposed to two different grades of humidities for a certain period. The relationship between the knock down effect due to blooming and the amount of the moisture of the paper surface was investigated. When the piled filter papers were exposed to a relative humidity of 90±2 per cent the moisture value of the surface was estimated to be between 6.2〜11.5 per cent in accordance with the interval of the exposed time, while when it exposed to a relative humidity 42±2 per cent the surface value became 4〜5 per cent. It was confirmed by bioassays that the higher the moisture value of the sheet the greater the knock down effect. It may be concluded, therefore, that the blooming effect of an insecticide decidedly increases under a higher humidity condition.

N2  - Effects of the four compounds, i. e., N-(2'-ethyl hexyl)-3, 6-endomethylene-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydrophthalimide; 3, 6-endomethylene-4-cyclohexene-1, 2-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester; Dihydronor cyclopenta dienyl isothiocyanate and N, N-Di-n-butyl-p-chlorobenzene sulfonamide were studied in an attempt to utilize them as synergists of DDT against resistant houseflies. The ratio of synergist to technical DDT was one to five. The (LD)_<50> value for the resistant Hokota strain was above 60 microgram per female fly on DDT alone, whereas it was 3.898 microgram on mixture of DDT and Dihydronor cyclopenta dienyl isothiocyanate, 14.127 microgram on mixture of DDT and N-(2'-ethyl hexyl)-3, 6-endomethylene-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydrophthalimide, 14.462 microgram on mixture of DDT and 3, 6-endomethylene-4-cyclohexene-1, 2-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester. The technical DDT containing synergist was much effective in causing knockdown of the resistant Kokura, Hokota, Ibaraki, Nebi, Obitsu and P-9 strains. A smaller synergistic effect was found when it was applied against the susceptible S. R. S. strain. Dihydronor cyclopenta dienyl isothiocyanate showed also a high degree of synergism as well as N, N-Di-n-butyl-p-chlorobenzene sulfonamide.

N2  - Using DDT added by a synergist and Baytex a series of control tests against diazinon and DDT resistant houseflies were carried out during September 24 to October 31, 1963, in Nebi area of Miho Village, Ibaraki Prefecture. Residual and larvicidal treatments with DDT alone and a mixture containing Dihydronor cyclopenta dienyl isothiocyanate as a synergist, at 2.5 gram per square metre, were made to cover all the ceilings and the breeding sites. Considerable decrease of fly-population was recognized in the case of DDT containing synergist. Residual sprays and larvicidal treatments of Baytex emulsion, at 0.25 gram in active ingredients per square metre, gave satisfactory control effect through the period of the experiment.

N2  - Distributional records and biological informations on three Japanese wild cockroaches, Blattella nipponica Asahina, Liosilphoidea sp. and Anaplectella sp., were reported. Blattella nipponica was commonly found and collected afield from many localities of Tottori, Shimane, Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, and Kumamoto Prefectures, in the western part of Japan. Liosilphoidea sp. and Anaplectella sp., however, were found from only one locality, Omuta City, Fukuoka Pref., whereupon was often observed the former species coexisting with B. nipponica not only in field but also in human dwellings. It seems to be caused by repeated intrusions from their natural habitats. The data of laboratory rearing experiments led to an estimation that the adult stage of B. nipponica usually appears three times a year and that of Liosilphoidea sp. does two times. Female adult of Liosilphoidea brought her oothecae for about a week and then deposited on some wet substances such as the cotton mass for water supply. Larvae hatched usually in a period of 2-3 weeks after release of oothecae from female.

N2  - Comparative studies were made on the pleural structures of the thorax of adult mosquitoes of 58 species collected from Japan. It was demonstrated through these observations, that tribes, genera, subgenera, some species-groups or species could readily be separated by the pleural characters, such as the presence or the absence, or the numbers and the arrangements of certain bristles and/or scales. The figures of each species and the key to differenciate these groups by the pleural structures were presented together with the description in Japan for all the species concerned. The above study suggests that examination of the pleural structures of the mosquitoes are of essential taxonomic importance, and that it often provides information most convenient or valuable for the identification of the species or species-groups of the mosquitoes.

During the year of 1962 and 1963, twenty-four nests of the Japanese house-martin, Delichon urbica dasypus, were obtained from various parts in Hokkaido. 12017 fleas representing four species were obtained from these nests. The species are Ceratophyllus farreni chaoi, Callopsylla (Orneacus) waterstoni, Ceratophyllus olsufjevi, and Frontopsylla (Orfrontia) sp. The detail of the results of the census of fleas in nests from eight districts are shown in Table 1.

N2  - A patient (43 years old, ♂) who expectorated larvae and pupae of Psychoda alternata Say (Diptera : Psychodidae) in sputum was reported in this paper. During the last four years the patient has suffered from bronchiectasis, and for the last two years his breath has had an offensive odor. With his offensive and fetid odor, the gathering of moth-flies and other undetermined small flies around his face has been observed by the patient. This phenomenon was conspicuous when he lay down. The cause of this phenomenon is presumed as the existance of certain chemical in his breath that attracts these flies. In his discharge, flies were observed four times, during the period from the end of May to the middle of June. The stages of discharged flies were of larval at the first and the second time, and were of pupal at the third and fourth. Vigorous movement of the larvae were observed immediately after their discharge. The route of infestation was presumed as follow. The laying of eggs by the adult female attracted by the odour of patient's breath, was done on the moist part arround his nose or mouth. And then the movement of the eggs or hatched larvae into his trachea happened when he inspired and the growth of larvae was done internally.

Overwintered adult insects collected from Koga, Ibaraki Prefecture, were used. Five emulsion of insecticides, γ-BHC (lindane), DDT, chlordane, diazinon and DDVP were tested through residue contact method using impregnated filter papers in various concentrations, and LC_<-50> values were assessed from the obtained results. It was confirmed that lindane is most excellent in the LC_<-50> value, and DDT comes next; but its concentration-mortality regression line shows a gentleslope; the others are following sequence of descending oder in the LC_<-50> value : i. e. diazinon, chlordane, DDVP.

N2  - Following 1961 and 1962 experiments, a series of spray tests, in order to check the residual effect of Sumithion and Dipterex, were carried out using several summer-huts located in Hachioji-city, west of Tokyo. 1. During May-June period of 1963, residues of 0.5% Sumithion emulsion (0.25 gram of active ingredient per squaer metre) gave 80-99% knock-down for about one month against susceptible Takatsuki flies. Difference in the knoc kdown effect between the shadowy huts and the sunny huts has hardly been recognized 2. Residues of 0.5% Dipterex emulsion (0.25 gram Dipterex per square metre) showed about 70-80% knockdown effect against susceptible (Takatsuki) strain through 35 days in the shadowy huts located among the trees. Against diazinon-resistant flies (RP strain) the residues of Sumithion and Dipterex gave a higher kill than that of diazinon, but a slight cross-resistance with diazinon would not be denied.

DDVP emulsion was treated as residual spray or larvicides in 5 areas, while DDVP bait, named "fly cake", was applied in 4 areas. By residual spray or larvicidal treatment, at 0.15 gram to 0.25 gram in active ingredients per square metre, the fly population estimated by ribbon traps decreased considerably, but more satisfactory effect was obtained by using 0.25% DDVP bait.

N2  - 1) The control tests of mosquitoes and flies by residual spray of dieldrin and Baytex were conducted in Amami Island, an endemic area of Bancroftian filariasis, in summer of 1962. The resistance levels of mosquitoes and flies, i. e. larvae and adults of Culex pipiens and Armigeres subalbatus, and adults of Musca domestica vicina and Chrysomya spp., after three applications of the chemicals were compared with the susceptibility levels assessed before the applications. 2) The residual spray of Baytex was highly effective to housefly and mosquito, though not so effective to Chrysomya spp. The applications of dieldrin were scarcely effective both to housefly and mosquito. 3) Among four species of mosquitoes and flies, Armigeres subalbatus showed of high resistance by the residual spray of dieldrin, and the adults of C. pipiens showed of slight resistance to dieldrin. All of four species have not showen any marked resistance to Baytex, and those except the above two species also have not shown of any marked resistance to dieldrin.

N2  - Denken and Kunetsu colonies of Culex pipiens and Denken and Yui colonies of the same species were selected by the treatments of dieldrin and Baytex, respectively, both in adult and larval stages for several generations in laboratory, adopting the dipping method in larvae and the topical application method in adults. After the results, any marked resistance has developed neither by the selection of dieldrin nor by that of Baytex. Though slight increase of LD_<-50> in adult mosquitoes were observed. This may perhaps be ascribed to the fact that those colonies were already highly resistant to dieldrin. To Baytex, in the contrary, the colonies were susceptible and the resistant gene to Baytex was not or scarcely existent in the populations.

N2  - It is rather curious that any attempt has not been made to control the larvae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus in the paddy field despite of the fact this is the most important vector of Japanese B encephalitis in this country. Along with helicopter spray of various insecticides against the rice-stem borer at the Mizukaido area, Ibaraki Prefecture, a spray test of 2% Baytex dust was made on July 16th, 1963, against the paddy-field mosquito larvae in the same area. This test was followed by a series of model experiments using various Baytex formulation in the field and laboratory. 1. By aerial spray of 2% Baytex dust, 30kg per hectare (60mg/m^2 in active ingredient) the larvae of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and of Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis in the paddy field were checked for three days. On the fourth day, however, in some spot of the treated area a few earlier instar larvae were found to develope, and on the sixth day grown larvae were recognized also. The whole population of the mosquito larvae almost recovered on the tenth day. 2. A small-scale application at a paddy field at Toyoda, west of Tokyo, revealed that 2% Baytex dust fails to kill the larvae on the seventh day of the application. On the other hand, 5% grains of Baytex strewn on the paddy field (60mg per square metre in active ingredient) showed 14 days efficacy when tested by the water of the paddy field. 3. In order to compare the residual effects of five Baytex products small artificial rice-fields, one square metre and framed by concrete, were used. The active Baytex ingredient was equally 60mg per square metre, this is about 1 ppm to the water within the frame. The effect of each products is as follows : 1% floating dust 6 days, 5% grain 8 days, 2% dust 5 days, emulsion 2 days, wettable powder 1 day. 4. Small pots in which rice-plant was deposited, were used for further comparison of the residual effect of the five products. Each product, one ppm in active ingredient, were added into the water, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus larvae reared in laboratory were put into it at ceatain intervals. 5% grain lasted at least 14 days, one percent floating dust was effective until 7th day, 2% dust and wettable powder gave similar result with the floating dust. 5. It may be concluded from the model experiments that Baytex floating dust or grains must be more promising than the 2% dust applied at the practical text.

N2  - Field control tests by insecticides against Anopheles sinensis and Culex tritaeniorhynchus were carried out from June through August, 1963, in a paddy field, Kawasaki. Wettable powder and granules of DDT, wettable powder, granules and floating dust of Baytex and Dieldrin dust were tested with various dosages. Little difference was recognized between DDT and Baytex, though the former seemed to have slightly longer residual effect than the latter. Application of wettable powder and floating dust gave better effect than that of granules. Regarding DDT and Baytex wettable powder as well as Baytex floating dust, 0.1-0.5ppm or 10-50 mg/m^2 in active ingredients should be applied to obtain a practically effective result. When a longer residual effect is expected, at least the dosage of 1.0-3.0 ppm or more of DDT wettable powder or Baytex floating dust should be applied.

N2  - During the period from 25 May to 5 June 1962, one of the authors, Rokuro Kano, made a survey of medically important flies on Okinawa Main Island of the Ryukyu Islands. This work resulted in a collection of more than 2, 000 fly specimens. Some years before this (December 1952-May 1953), Dr. Tokuichi Shiraki surveyed both agriculturally and medically important flies on the Ryukyu Islands and also collected many fly specimens. The authors examined fly specimens of both surveys in detail, and found one new genus and three new species of sarcophagid flies among them. Regarding the generic names of these species, the authors followed the opinion of Dr. B. B. Rohdendorf and Dr. H. S. Lopes.

Collecting records of E. murina from rats in Japan were described. "E. gallinacea" has been believed to be common on rats in southwestern part of Japan, but the writer has the opinion that the species recorded as E. gallinacea in this country may be corrected as E. murina.

N2  - 1. Comparative biometrical studies were made on the 4th instar larvae of colonies of Culex pipiens s. l. collected at several localities from southern to northern Japan. The investigations were started by examining the differences between a laboratory colony of pallens-form (DE-colony) originated from Tokyo and two colonies of fatigans-form collected from endemic areas of bancroftian filariasis in Amami (KO-colony) and in Ryukyu (TA-colony). Further observations were made to accumulate the same line of characters pertaining their hybrids or individuals of colonies collected from other localities. 2. The above three colonies which represented pallens and fatigans forms were found to differ in the distributions of values of siphonal index or in the number of pairs of siphonal hairs as had previously been pointed out, but better defined differences could be detected in the number of branches of the first and the second subventral siphonal hair tufts or in the relative length of these hairs to the width of siphon. The number of the branches in fatigans form was mostly 6 to 8 while that in pallens form was usually 2 or 3. The relative hair length to the width of siphon (HL/SW) was 0.85 in KO-colony and 1.08 in TA-colony but was 1.42 in DE-colony in the average. These values were intermediate for the hybrid colonies between the two forms. 3. Since the above three colonies were bred under the same condition for a number of generations in the laboratory, the above characters seemed to be genetically defined. In the selective breedings of individuals with 8 branched one from TA-colony, the percentage of larvae provided with this character increased from 20.7 in parent generation to 50.0 in F_1, 81.5 in F_2 and 78.2 in F_3. 4. In the comparative biometrical observations with a number of colonies collected from southern to northern Japan, gradual increase in the values of the siphonal index and of the number of branches of siphonal hair tufts, as well as the gradual decrease in the relative hair length were seen as the localities of collection moved towards the south. The only exception was Kawasakicolony, which represented an autogenous or molestus form and morphologically closer to fatigans form than pallens or anautogenous form of the same area.

N2  - The attractiveness of 20 amino acids and two decomposed products to Culex pipiens pallens were determined. A mouse, which wet with 0.5cc of the test solution at various concentrations, was used as an animal trap for the mosquitoes. The female mosquitoes trapped, most of which were fed to repletion, were counted and the ratio to the control well compared. Sulfur containing amino acids, methionine at 0.01% and cystine at 0.001% were highly attractive as 9.7 and 7.0 in the relative attractiveness respectively. Hydrogen sulfide, a decomposed product from sulfur containing amino acids, was also highly attractive as methionine. Glycine, lysine and threonine in 1.0%, tryptophane in 0.1%, tyrosine, arginine glutamic acid, serine and leucine in 0.01% and aspartic acid in 0.001% were also more or less attractive to the mosquitoes. The relationship between the best attractive concentration of each amino acid and the quantity in animal tissues and blood was discussed.

N2  - In order to obtain basic data for paddy-field mosquito control, a survey of the mosquito population and its fluctuation was carried out during the season of 1962, at a paddy-field in the suburbs of Kawasaki. The mosquitoes collected through the survey consist of nine species belonging four genera. Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis occupied the majority of the specimens collected from the paddy-field, whereas, Culex hayashii was a dominant species in the irrigation ditch. During the period of the rice nursery, the breeding of mosquito larvae was not abundant yet, because of the area covered by water is restricted and the season is too early. After the riceplanttransplantation (June 11-17th), C. tritaeniorhynchus and A. sinensis increased remarkably. They were, however, entirely eradicated on July 14th by the parathion spray which was made for the rice stem borer control. The population density of mosquitoes almost recovered nine days thereafter, and, on July 24th, the second peak of mosquito abandance was observed when the drainage began. Drainage was repeated for eight times until the final one (Sept. 13th) when the irrigation ceased completely. The period when the mosquito larvae most prevailed was estimated approximately 40 days begining from the riceplant-transplantation to the first drainage. It was fortunate to say that the parathion was applied in the middle of period giving favorable effect upon mosquito control. From the result stated above, the authors assume that if appropriate insecticide was applied twice between the riceplant-transplantation and the final drainage, or, drainage procedure was attempted twice, it will give a decisive effect upon the mosquito control in the paddy-field.

N2  - 1. The lumber yards located on the low coastal area of Tokyo are supplied with waters subjected to sewage pollution and subsequent successive breeding of the mosquitoes of Culex pipiens group. 2. The mosquito species, prevalent at Sarue lumber yard, and, has been becoming a serious pest since several years, was Culex pipiens pallens accompanied with a great many Culex pipiens forma molestus and small populations of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis. It seems noteworthy, in this country, that the autogenous C. molestus made an abundant appearance since an early summer season in an open water like lumber yard. 3. It may be also noteworthy that the LC_<50> against p, p′-DDT of C. molestus larvae showed such a high value as 17.78ppm; the same species also gave, at the same time, a high resistant value against γ-BHC and dieldrin. 4. The LC_<50> value of Culex pipiens pallens larvae was extremely high when compared with those of other populations of the same species in this country. It seems doubtful to get a sufficient control effect against these populations by chlorinated hydrocarbons. 5. However, organophosphorous insecticides showed high efficiency as indicated by the following sequence : Baytex-Sumithion-Nankor-DDVP-diazinon-malathion-Dibrom-Dipterex. 6. Against Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis larvae both hydrocarbons and OP-compounds gave excellent efficiency. 7. By application of 0.3% DDVP oil solution, 60ml/m^2, a larval check was recognized for three or four days. 8. By application of 5% diazinon emulsion, diluted 50 times, and sprayed 100ml/m^2, a larval check was seen for four days. 9. By application of 1% or 3% Baytex floating dust 1 to 2 gram/m^2 a larval check was seen for about 14 days. 10. Against the pupal stage of these mosquito species DDVP oil solution showed a high efficiency, while diazinon emulsion, which was rather insufficient in dosis in the present test, did not affect satisfactory. Baytex floating dust was satisfactory when applied to the pupae. 11. Adult survey by a light-trap showed that : 1. In the case of DDVP oil solution the adults population recovered 4-5 days after the spray; 2. In the case of Baytex floating dust the adult mosquitoes were satisfactorily checked, so that no adult was trapped after Aug. 22.

N2  - N, N-Di-n-butyl-p-chlorobenzene sulfonamide was studied as a synergist for DDT against resistant houseflies. The ratio of N, N-Di-n-butyl-p-chlorobenzene-sulfonamide against technical DDT was 1 to 5. The dosage required to obtain 50 per cent mortality ((LD)_<50>) for the resistant Hokota strain was above 60 microgram per female fly on DDT alone, whereas it was 2.35 microgram on mixture containing synergist. The technical DDT plus N, N-Di-n-butyl-p-chlorobenzene sulfonamide was much effective in causing knockdown of CSMA, Obitsu, P-9 and Nebi strains. Fairly high efficacy was still obtained when the concentration of DDT was cut in half. It also activated γ-BHC against the resistant Ebina strain. A similar synergistic effect was recognized for DDT when it was applied as larvicide against the larvae of resistant fly.

In the synergism to pyrethrins evaluated in terms of (LD)_<50> or (KT)_<50> for each synergized formulation used in the test, the five synergists are ranked as follows in order of superiority for the respective methods indicated : Topical Application : piperonyl butoxide, n-propyl-isom, Safroxan, MGK 264, S-421 Spray Chamber : piperonyl butoxide, n-propylisom, MGK-264, S-421, Safroxan Petri-dish Contact : piperonyl butoxide, MGK-264, n-propyl-isom, Safroxan, S-421 In the synergism to allethrin evaluated on the same basis as above, the five are ranked in superioirty as follows : Topical Application : S-421, Safroxan, n-propylisom, piperonyl butoxide, MGK-264 Spray Chamber : S-421, piperonyl butoxide, Safroxan, MGK-264 Petri-dish Contact : MGK-264, piperonyl butoxide, S-421, Safroxan, n-propyl-isom As used with each principal toxicant, the order of superiority among the five synergists varied with the test method employed. Regardless of the method employed, however, the synergistic effect of piperonyl butoxide on pyrethrins and that of S-421 on allethrin were indisputably high.

N2  - A wild Blattella species apparently closely allied to the German cockroach, Blattella germanica Linne, has been known to occur in the coast area of western part of Japan. Furukawa (1948) supposed it to be the same with Blattella bisignata Brunner von Wattenvyl which was, however, described from Burma and now believed to be a geographical race of the small-sized South Asiatic Blattella lituricollis Walker. The present author came to the conclusion that this species represents a distinct, undescribed species, and named it as Blattella nipponica sp. nov. The main distinguishing characteristics are, when compared with those of Bl. germanica, as follows : 1. The paired black stripes on the prothorax broad and always show the tendency to access each other at the posterior ends (Fig.1) 2. The structure of the dorsal glands of the male 7 and 8 abdominal segments quite different, and there are numerous short bristles on 7 segment (Fig. 2, 3). 3.The male subgenital plate short and broad, the assymmetrical depression, when seen from ventral side, is shallow; the two styli situated closely (Fig. 4, 5). 4. The left epiphallus of male genitalia ending in a claw which is sparcely punctured (Fig.6). 5. The female supraanal plate, in a fresh or alcoholic specimen, slightly emarginated at the posterior end, with two dark spot at the base (Fig.7). This species distributes in the southwestern part of Japan as far south as Tanegashima but never found in Ryukyus (Fig. 9). The type specimens are selected from Tanegashima material. The life-history is not still sufficiently made known, they are found in the roadside grass-land of seaside, or under dead leaves collected at forest edge, or among decayed vegetable matter in cultivated land. Overwintering is made during later larval instars and two generations are supposed to be passed in a year. These can be bred in a laboratory by similar method to the German cockroach. It may be interesting to note that this species can fly while the German cockroach does not; attempts to hybridize both failed so far.

N2  - Comparative studies were made to see the effects of humidity and temperature on the breedings of three species of the grain mites, Tyrophagus dimidiatus (T.d.), Aleuroglyphus ovatus (A.o.) and Glycyphagus destructor (G. d.). In T. d., the optimum condition for the highest densities in their breeding in dried yeast was 75% in relative humidity (R. H.) and 25℃ in temperature, and the ranges of humidity and temperature to allow its breeding were relatively restricted. The optimum condition for A.o. was seen at 85% R. H. and 30℃, and the ranges were much larger, since the species was found to breed under the low humidity, or up to 35℃ under the high humidity, under which condition the former species could not survive. In G.d., the optimum was 85% R. H. and 25℃, and the velocity of the breeding was generally slower than in the former two species. Further experiments were made to compair the effects of humidity and temperature on the ratio in densities of the above three species cultured in the same food samples. The material inseminated was the mixed culture of the grain mites with A.o. as the predominant species. In all the samples kept in low humidity, or in those at 25℃ and 30℃ under various humidities, A.o. maintained the highest in the density, and all the other species were found to disappear at 30℃. At high humidity and at 20℃, either G.d. or T.d. became the dominant for certain period.

N2  - 1) This paper deals with the control effect of soil fumigant D-D and DBCP against the pupae, Musca domestica vicina during 30th July and 23rd November in 1960. 2) The distribution of pupae in glass cylinder (diameter of 9.5 cm, depth of 30cm), the number of pupation of larvae in 3cm depth are the most abundant, although they distributed around between 1-14cm depth, and the number of individuals showed 81.8, 17.7 and 0.68% of the total in each 5cm depth downward. 3) According to the result of experiment, when the each solutions of D-D (0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 30cc) was poured into the soil in the depth of 5, 10 and 15cm separately it is known that the emergency was never occured. The efficiency of 2% emulsion of DBCP (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0cc) against the pupae in the soil showed lesser effect than D-D solution, which showed 90% control effect at the following conditions : 2.5cc DBCP applied in depth of 5cm, 30cm, and 10cm, respectively. 4) According to the result of experiment being sprayed with D-D, DBCP, lindane, dieldrin, aldrin and endrin, on the surface of the soil, 11 adults emerged out among 100 pupae with D-D and 82 adults with DBCP, 75 with lindane, 93-dieldrin, 92-aldrin, 79-endrin respectively. 5) As the result of field test of D-D solution, only 7 individuals were emerged out of 100 when D-D poured into 15cm depth. But DBCP showed control effect as followed : 54.5, 32.5, 33.5% at each depth of 5, 10, 15cm. 6) Although this paper showed the results under the natural temperature. It is thought that further examination should be carried out under the condition of lower temperature.

N2  - Sarcophaga pseudoscoparia is fairly common in Europe, but hitherto it has never been reported in Japan and Korea. The authors obtained two male specimens in 1962. The first specimen was collected by Soung Ho Park on Mt. Pal-gong, Korea, 28 June 1962. The second specimen was collected by Mr. Kiyoyuki Mizusawa on Mt. Orofure, near Noboribetsu, Hokkaido, Japan, 22 July 1962, who, in turn, gave the specimen to Senior author for further study and investigation. Sarcophaga pseudoscoparia seems to be very rare in both these countries.

N2  - The result of the research on the seasonal prevalence of the smoky brown cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa Serville in the house at miki-cho in Kagawa Prefecture, extending from 1960 to 1962, was described in the present paper. Although the outline of the result was shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, some considerations and discussions on the prevalence of its stage or our control were also made in this paper.

N2  - Comparative morphological studies were made with the adults of three laboratory bred colonies of Culex pipiens s.l. which were originally collecte d from Tokyo (DE) in eastern Japan and from Amami (KO) and south Ryukyu (TA) in the south. The latter two represent the so-called fatigans-form, while the first is of pallens-form. Conspicuous patches composed of dark scales were detected on abdominal sternites III to VII of the latter two colonies, which were found to lack almost completely in the first. The patches, when present, were more conspicuous in the males than in the females. Differences were also seen in the transverse white bands on abdominal tergites of females, which were nearly linear in the former and were arched posteriorly in the latter two. Differences between the above two forms were also seen in the cell-stem index of the wings, which were seen more obviously in the males with the critical value of about 2.40 between the groups. The measurements of the male genitalia were made with the values of 100×D/V in the place of DV/D of the previous authors. The two groups could be differentiated at D/V value of 50 where those for DE were larger and for TA and KO were smaller than this value. All of the biometrical values of the hybrid colonies of the two groups discussed here were roughly intermediate. Although the above two groups were found to differ in the experimental populations, overlappings of the individual values between the groups were always seen for these values.

N2  - Laboratory observations on the effect of some larval environmental conditions upon the development, mortality or the size of adults were made with a colony of the mosquito, Culex pipiens s.l.. 1. Temperature. The first instar larvae were bred under regulated temperature ranging from 10℃ to 38℃. The rates of pupation of the larvae were 0% at 10℃, 81.3% at 15℃, 92.6% at 18℃, 71.3% at 20℃, 78.0% at 25℃ and 28℃, 68.3% at 32℃ and 0% at 38℃. The days required for the larvae to develop into pupae varied greatly by the temperature, especially in the range between 18℃ and 25℃, such as the average of 20.4 days at 15℃ and 5.4 days at 28℃. No significant differences by the temperature were seen in the sex ratio or in the size of black patches on abdominal sternites. The size of adults as measured by the wing length was the largest in those bred at low temperature, and became smaller as it became higher. 2. Amount of food. Each 25, 50 and 100 larvae were bred in the same size of containers to which different amount of food ranging from 50 to 2, 000mg of diet for experimental animals was given at the start. The optimum amount of food as observed by the lowest mortality was about 10mg per larva for the lot of 25 and 50 larvae per containers and was some 5mg per larva for the lot of 100. In the range from 2 to 10mg of food per larva, the average wing length of adults became longer as the amount of food was increased. 3. Size of the containers. In the experiments using different size of containers with the surface varying from 60 to 480 square cm. and to which the same number of larvae (100), the same amount of food (400mg) and the same depth of water was added, the mortality of larvae became lower but the larval periods became longer as the containers were larger. 4. Density of larvae. Different numbers of larvae from 25 to 150 were reared in each same size of vials containing 50ml. of water and enough but not excess of food was given every day. The mortality of larvae became higher as the density was greater, but the absolute number of pupae being reared from a vial increased as the density was larger.

N2  - Experiments were made to produce radioactive mosquitoes of a laboratory bred colony of Culex pipiens s.l. from Tokyo. Among the three methods tested here, best results were obtained by rearing the fourth instar larvae with the water containing P^<32>. A series of experiments were repeated to rear the larvae with various strength of radioactivity ranging from 3.0μc to 0.01μc, and the radioactivity of the females emerged from them were counted for the period of 15 days. It was observed that the readings of the counts increased as the concentration of P^<32> in water was higher, and even with the minimum lot reared in water of 0.01μc it gave 487 to 125 cpm per mosquito for the period from 1 to 15 days after emergence. High mortality of pupae was seen in the lots reared in waters containing the doses above 1.0μc. The female mosquitos fed with syrup containing 1.0 and 2.0μc of P^<32> per ml. gave the average readings of 84.9 cpm and 171.8 cpm respectively, but the counts were lower than those obtained by the above method. Females which were engorged with the blood of a mouse to which 100μc were injected intraperitoneally 10 hours before, also gave the average count of 113.9μc above the background counts.

N2  - The relation between oviposition of fly and fish was studied. The results obtained may be summarized as follows : 1) Flies laid many eggs on stale fish, head and gill. In the case of stale fish they preferred white colour muscle than red or intermediate color one. They averted the fish having lower water content, red muscle and even surface of meat. 2) Flies laid few eggs on fish which were treated with various kinds of flavour (cinnamon, pimenta, cardamon, nutmeg), smoking liquor, asunaron, hinokitiol and amino acid.

N2  - In the former paper, the authors reported that the house-fly, Musca domestica vicina, emerged out of the animal fecal material, especially in a large number out of the feces of swine. In this experiment, the relation between feces of cattle, horses and swine under the same condition and the development of house-fly larvae was investigated. The fecal materials with 25 eggs of the house-fly were put into a glass column, 3.5cm in diameter and 12cm in depth, and were incubated at 30℃. The results were summarized as follows : 1. The quality of the media was compared by the weight and the rate of the pupae bred out of the media. 2. Fresh feces of the animals were dried in the room temperature to keep the amount of water in feces on the equal level. The mixture of each 5g of the dried feces and 20ml of water was used as the media for larvae of the house-fly. The pupation rate and weight of pupa were fairly better and heavier with the feces of swine than with those of cattle and horses. 3. When 5g of feces were added with 2g of pepton, more pupae were bred in all cases than in feces alone. It was specially remarkable with the feces of horses. But pupae were scarcely bred out of the media of pepton alone. 4. The development of the larvae was influenced by the oldness of the feces. In old feces of cattle and horses the larvae scarcely developed, while in cases of swine the larvae emerged well both in old and new feces.

N2  - During 1961 poliomyelitis epidemic in Kumamoto Prefecture, Kyushu, we had an opportunity to survey poliomyelitis viruses of flies, cockroaches and some other associated materials obtained in the epidemic area. For the period of 12 to 18 June, collection was made in Tensui, Yatsushiro-city and Hitoyoshi-city, where the cases of poliomyelitis had been seen more abundant. The names and the numbers of the flies and the cockroaches, which were collected and used for virus survey, are shown in Table 1 and 2, respectively. Of 2, 290 individuals of the adult flies, 20 individuals of the fly larvae, 61 individuals of the cockroaches and 7 materials obtained from their breeding site, were tested, 17 samples of 933 flies belong to 17 species and 11 samples of the other materials for isolation of poliomyelitis viruses. Tube cultures of monkey kidney cell were used. Of 28 tested samples, one proved positive for poliomyelitis virus, which belongs to the type 2. This sample was composed of five adult flies of Chrysomya megacephala trapped in Hitoyoshi-city.

N2  - The studies were made by topical application and larvae-dipping method in two strains (a moderate-resistant, and a susceptible) of house flies (Musca dometica) to determine whether the mixtures of Diazinon and Dibrom, Diazinon and DDVP, and Diazinon and Ronnel indicated synergism. The mixtures each cantaining Diazinon+Dibrom, +DDVP and+Ronnel at various ratios indicated slight synergistic or similar action in the Diazinon-resistant strain, while they gave independent or similar action to the susceptible one. From the results obtained, a mixture of Diazinon and DDVP was the best against both of the Diazinon-resistant adults and larvae of house flies. The problem as to how the mixture compounds could confer synergism to the Diazinon-resistant fllies was discussed.

N2  - 1) Laboratory experiments were carried out to assess the residual effects of several Baytex formulations, i.e. 10% granule, 5% granule, 2% granule, 1% floating dust, 5% emulsifiable concentrate and 1% oil solution, on larvae of mosquito, Culex pipiens s. l. and to assess the amount of toxicants released into water from 5% Baytex granule with bioassay tests. 2) Among the above six formulations, 5% granule, 1% oil solution and 5% emulsifiable concentrate were superior in residual effect, being effective to larvae for 15 to 23 days after the application of 1 ppm of active ingredients. 3) With the application of 2 ppm of Baytex in 5% granular formulation, the release of toxicants into water was slower during the initial week, active during the following week and slower again thereafter. After the release the toxicants in water decreased with elapse of time. The amount of Baytex existing in water were shown to be the maximum in two or three weeks after the treatment. 4) Leaving 5% Baytex granule in water together with soil, the amount of Baytex in water was assessed to be far less than that without soil and decreased with elapse of time, though it was approximately 27 times of LC-90 of Baytex to 1st instar larvae after one day and 2.4 times even after four weeks.

N2  - 1) Field experiments on the effects of several Baytex formulations, especially of 5% granule, on larvae of Culex pipiens s.l. in ditches and artificial containers were carried out in Kawasaki, Amami Island and Tokyo, Japan, from August to December, 1962. 2) By the application of 5% Baytex granule to ditches at the rate of 2 ppm of active ingredients to volume of water, all the larvae and pupae dis-appeared after two or three days. Reappearance occurred after 15 days in 1st or 2nd instar larvae, after 17 days in 3rd or 4th instar larvae and after 18 to 20 days or thereafter in pupae. The intervals of the application of the granules should be of 17 to 20 days in practical control of the larvae, being far longer than the other chemicals such as diazinon emulsions. 3) By the application of 5% Baytex granule to artificial containers at the rate of 2 ppm of active ingredients to volume of water, effective period was 6 weeks in one case and more than 13 weeks in the other case, being far longer than that in ditches.

N2  - Similar to our 1961 autumn experiment, a series of tests, in order to critically check the residual effect of several organophosphorus insecticides, were carried out using several summer-huts located at Shiroyama camp-site in Hachicji, west of Tokyo. 1. During May-June period of 1962, difference between normal and diazinon-resistant strains of houseflies exposed to 0.5% diazinon residue was clearly recognized. Against diazinon-resistant flies the residues of 0.5% Nankor (Ronnel), 0.5% DDVP and 0.5% Dibrom gave a higher kill than that of diazinon, but a slight cross-resistance with diazinon would not be denied. 2. During September-October period of 1962, the efficiency of Nankor and Dibrom was further observed. Against both normal and diazinon-resistant strains Dibrom was slightly superior to Nankor when tested at 24 hours after the spray, but vice versa after seven days. Both the insecticides showed greater efficiency in the huts located in the forest than in the huts standing in open grassy place. A similar tendency was recognized with our previous experiments using DDT and γ-BHC. 3. Throughout both the test periods it may be concluded that under a warmer environment, where the daytime temperature rises up to 30℃, the residual effect of organophosphorus insecticides does not last more than 15 days after the spray.

N2  - A field test of fly and mosquito control using Sumithion (O, O-dimethyl-O-(3-methyl-4-nitrophenyl) phosphorothioate) were carried out during July and August, 1962, in a rural district of Osaka Prefecture. In the dwellings, 200cc of 0.5% kerosene solution of Sumithion per 33m^2 was applied as aerosol. In the barns of live stock, 100cc of 0.5% Sumithion emulsion per a square meter was sprayed on the ceiling and walls. These applications were repeated at intervals of 14 days. While, one liter of 0.1% Sumithion emulsion per a square meter were sprayed over the floors of the barns of live stock, privies and cess pools. The poultry houses, heaps of barnyard manure and dumps were applied with dust of 2% Sumithion. These applications were repeated once a week. In the results, the population of house flies in the dwellings estimated by fly ribbon traps decreased after those applications. This was more remarkable in the barns of live stock than in human dwellings. The decrease was supposed to be attributable mainly to the effect of the larvicide applied over the floors of the barns of live stock. The application of one liter of 0.05% Sumithion emulsion per a square meter was effective to Sarcophagid fly larvae in privies, but the larvae reappeared in 4 or 7 days after the application. The breeding areas of mosquito larvae-ditches, cess pools, small ponds and other pools-was sprayed with 100cc of 0.1% Sumithion emulsion per a square meter. The treatment was effective for the control of larvae. However, the number of mosquitoes captured by the light trap (New Jersey Model) were not decreased. Most of species those captured were supposed to be bred in the neighboring rice-fields of the treated village. Therefore, it must be concluded that the mosquitoes in a village will not be controlled by treating with Sumithion the village area only.

N2  - Field tests for fly control with several organophosphorus insecticides, i.e. DDVP, Diazinon, Malathion, Nankor, Dibrom and Dipterex, were carried out during 1958 to 1962, in rural destricts of Saitama prefecture, Japan. Ten-or 20-fold dilutions of these insecticide emulsives were treated as residual spray on the ceiling of the dwellings and the cattle barns, and for the breeding sites of house fly 200-or 300-fold dilutions were sprayed in every two weeks. The fly population estimated by paper traps set on the floor decreased remarkably and continuously with any insecticides which were tested.

N2  - Observation was made on severe harm seemingly caused by Culicoides in Terao, the suburbs of Niigata, at the end of May 1961. Collected Culicoides were 6 species, of which C. epactius was dominant (56.5%). Examination of specimens collected by biting collection and samples brought by the people suggested that the damage was made by C. epactius, C. arakawae, and C. circumscriptus. Harm was found to be severer at the hill, residental area, and fields, particularly in the fine, calm evening of summer. Bited lesions were naked sites of the human body and in some cases other parts covered with hair and dress. In 36 cases, just after biting, sharp itching occurred and was followed by the growth of reddish eruption with fever, around which infiltration was noticed. In most cases, symptoms disappeared several hours to four days after the attack of the insects, whereas scraping the surface of the lesions resulted in forming blister or suppuration to be coured sometimes more than a month later.

Filter paper which soaked with 0.5% kerosene solution at rate of 50cc per square meter and stocked at 24℃for 2, 4 or 6 hours gave higher knockdown effect to the house flies than those for one hour. When the house fly larvae were treated with Dipterex emulsion by dipping method, the larvicidal effects were also raised almost 23 times with the emulsions aged for few days comparing with that prepared immediately after.

N2  - In order to obtain the fundamental data for the mosquito control operation, successive studies on the seasonal prevalences of larvae and pupae of mosquitoes were carried out during the period from May, 1961 to January, 1962 at 22 model stations in a suburbs of Setagaya district in Tokyo. Stations were divided into three groups as follows : AB-group : grooves of grave stone, water pots (A) and bamboo stumps (B) CD-group : drainages or trenches (C) and nightsoil tanks diluted with water (D) E-group : paddy field and swampy field (Fig.1) In above three groups the dominant species collected were Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens and Culex tritaeniorhynchus (sometimes Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis) respectively. In total 11, 304 mosquitoes belonging 4 genera, 8 species, i.e. Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, C. tritaeniorhynchus, C. vorax, Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis, Ae. vexans nipponii, Armigeres subalbatus and C. bitaeniorhynchus, were collected (Table 1). The most dominant species was C. pipiens, which occupied 86.6% of whole collection and other species were much smaller in number. Larvae collected were divided into four stages and pupa, of which per cent were shown in Table 1, i.e. the number decrease remarkably with stages advanced. According to the number collected in each month as shown in Table 2, Culex pipiens decrease considerably in August and in September, and on the contrary C. vorax increased in the same period. Larvae of C. pipiens existed even under -8℃ and survived until Jan. 12 (Tables. 4 and 6). C. pipiens was found in all stations except bamboo stumps, but other species seem to lost their breeding sites year by year, especially in the residential area in Tokyo. It may be safely concluded that C. pipiens is now the most important species for inhabitants in this area from the standpoints of long period of appearance, universality of breeding sites and adaptability to the environment.

At A level, rate of pupation was very low, and rate of emergence was 0%. At B, C, D and E levels, larvae developed to the adult stage. The period from hatching to emergence was shortest at B level (17-22 days) and was longer as the level became lower. The mean rate emergence at B, C, D and E levels were 53.0, 76.8, 57.1 and 3.8%, respectively. 2) The results rearing adults are shown in Table 2. The mean longevity of adult was shortest at A level, and longest at C level. The mean longevity of female at each level was longer than that of male at the same level, except one of the groups at A level. Female deposited eggs at A, B and C levels. The periods of their oviposition activity were 5-25, 8-55 and 24-135 days old, respectively. 3) Eggs deposited by adults kept at 15.0-23.0℃ were divided into each level. The hatching rates of the eggs were shown in Table 3. At A, B, C and D levels, eggs hatched of 100, 94-100, 100 and 42-72%, respectively, but eggs divided into E level did not hatch. While, the hatching rate of eggs deposited by adults kept at A level was only 43% at the same level. 4) From the results mentioned above, it is summarized that Aldrichina grahami repeats their successive generations at the range of about 13.0-26.0℃.

N2  - The farm manure is one of the most important sources in which breed flies in ordinary farm houses. In order to know what species of flies are bred in animal feces, the major material of the manure, the seasonal occurrence of flies was observed at the National Institute of Animal Industry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Chiba City, during the period from June 1960 to May 1961. In this experiment, the fecal materials of cattle, horses, swine and goats were used. The flies were bred in a pot of 11cm in diameter and 12cm in depth filled with the fecal materials. All of the emerged Diptera from the fecal materials were classified into 11 families and 14 species as shown in Table 2. The fly species, which are important for the public health and emerge in a great number, were the four, such as Musca domestica vicina, Muscina stabulans, Fannia canicularis and Stomoxys calcitrans. The majority of Musca domestica vicina emerged out during the period from June to October. This species emerged out from every animal fecal material, and especially in a large number from the feces of swine followed by those of horses. Many of Stomoxys calcitrans emerged out from the fecal materials of cattle and goats. The emergence of flies increased in the case of the feces mixed with feeds than that of the feces alone. The tendency was especially remarkable in Musca domestica vicina.

N2  - For the purpose of estimating the population size, or of evaluating the effect of control operation against domiciliary cockroaches, the so called "butter-trap" has been generally used in Japan. Glass bottles, plastic pots and jars, etc., are generally used as trap, in which some bait is laid and a small amount of butter is thinly smeared inside the trap. The cockroaches attracted to the bait set in the trap are captured by it, being unable to climb up the butter-smeared wall. As the current method seems too insufficient for standard method, the attempt was made to increase the efficiency of the trap. Our experiment was conducted using German cockroaches liberated in a large metal case under laboratory condition. Fifty samples of various baits were compared in 24 combinations of a unit of 4 samples. Rice bran, barn-yard millet and a kind of commercial poisonous bait relatively attracted more cockroaches than the others. Rice bran may be most suitable for trap bait, because of their attractiveness, availability and cheapness. Cylindrical glass pot of 9cm in diameter and 6cm in depth caught most cockroaches amongst 4 trap vesseles tested. Margarine smeared inside the trap was superior to vaseline. The trap covered outside with sugar-impregnated filter paper gave best catch.

N2  - In order to know the effect of various insecticides against a kind of poisonous beetle, Paederus fuscipes Curtis, a series of tests was carried out under laboratory condition. Seven insecticides, γ-BHC (lindane), DDT, dieldrin, chlordane, diazinon, malathion and DDVP were tested through a continuous contact method. The test-insects are adults of the poisonous beetle collected from Koga City, Ibaraki Prefecture. Through an experiment using the insecticide impregnated filter paper, it was confirmed that lindane is superior to DDVP in rapidity of knockdown. Using six insecticide dusts, it was further confirmed that the lindane is most excellent in the effect of rapidity; the others are following sequence of descending order in the rapidity : DDT, chlordane, malathion, diazinon, dieldrin. Against this particular pest, it seems that chlorinated hydrocarbons except dieldrin are more effective than organophosphorus insecticides. Dust of above mentioned insecticides treated in the rate of 1.5g per square metre appears to give sufficient result in practical control.

N2  - After larval control of blackfly, Simulium aokii, in a stream in Tokyo for 8 years by the application of mixed pastes of DDT 40% and lindane 1.6%, the resistance of larvae has developed highly to DDT and fairly to lindane. The LC-50's given by immersion test for 10 minutes were 7, 300ppm in DDT and 91ppm in lindane. These were far higher than those of blackfly larvae collected from a stream not applied with any chemical, which showed 570ppm and 35ppm of LC-50's in DDT and in lindane, respectively.

N2  - Laboratory tests were conducted on the effectiveness of 6 fly bait products against Diazinon-resistant and susceptible house flies (Musca domestica). A product containing Dimetilan (3-methyl-5-pyrazolyl dimethylcarbamate) as an active substance of a bait product was effective against both of the strains in the laboratory cage tests and superior to other bait products as a whole, i.e., B, containing Dipterex, C, DDVP and Diazinon, D, DDVP, and E, DDVP, but F product containing DDVP and Lindane was as effective against Diazinon-resistant flies as A product. However, in the room test concerning attractiveness and toxicity, A product was superior to F product. D, E and F products indicated high vapor effect. Also in evaluation on duration of effectiveness, A product was excellent. Dimetilan, as a bait treatment, would offer promising results for controlling Diazinon-resistant house flies known in Japan.

N2  - In autumn of 1960, the failure of house fly control occurred after residual applications of diazinon in several districts in Ibaraki Prefecture. The following experiments were carried out in laboratory concerning to the resistance of house fly to diazinon or to the other organophosphorus insecticides. 1) By the contact test using filter papers on which diazinon emulsions were applied, the KT 50's of four strains from these districts were 5 to 8 times longer than that of susceptible Takatsuki strain. 2) By the topical application test, the LD 50's of diazinon to these four strains were 15 to 25 times higher than that of Takatsuki strain, thougth only 2 to 3 times resistant or tolerant to malathion and DDVP. 3) The wire-netting method, bringing the flies into contact to residues of diazinon emulsion in wire-netting petri dishes, were proved to be suitable and available for distinguishing resistant strains from susceptible one. 4) The F_1 strains which crossed the resistant strain to susceptible one were intermediately resistant to diazinon and the F_2 slightly decreased the resistance comparing to F_1 strains.

N2  - Field control tests against diazinon resistant houseflies by the applications of mixed emulsion and Dimetilan bait were carried out during May 8 to July 14, 1962, in Mihara area of Hokota Village, Ibaraki Prefecture. The results may be summarized as follows : The mixture of diazinon and DDVP, and mixture of diazinon and Dibrom were treated as residual sprays and larvicides in 3 areas; Dimetilan was applied as a bait in 2 areas where houseflies have developed resistance to diazinon. By residual sprays and larvicidal treatments, at 0.25 gram in active ingredients per square metre, the fly population of dwellings estimated by ribbon traps decreased considerably. Application of Dimetilan bait at intervals of 20 days gave satisfactory control effect against the diazinon-resistant flies. Most satisfactory effect was obtained by using a combination of emulsion and Dimetilan bait.

N2  - Control tests of the diazinon-resistant house fly using Sumithion emulsion were carried out during June 10 to August 4, 1962, in Nebi area of Miho Village, Ibaraki Prefecture. In late 1960, it was found that a notable diazinon-resistance had developed in houseflies of this area. Treatments with Sumithion, at 0.25gram per square metre, were made to cover all the ceilings and breeding-places. The population densities estimated by ribbon traps decreased markedly through the period of the experiment. The effect was superior in an area treated with both residual and larvicide spray to the same treated with residual spray alone.

N2  - Field observations on the effects of residual sprays of sumithion, baytex and dieldrin to the populations of the house fly, the blowfly and the mosquito, Culex pipiens, s.l. were made in Amami Island, southern Japan. The insecticides were sprayed to wall of all houses in 6 villages (each 2 villages for one insecticide) by the ratio of 50ml. per square meter at the dilution of 0.5%. To estimate the populations, the number of egg rafts deposited on the surface of certain water containers were counted for the mosquito, the adhesive fly paper was used for the house fly, and the cage trap method was applied for the blow fly. In the case of baytex, more than 90% reduction in the number of the house fly counts were observed for 44 days in one village and for 30 days in another. The reduction in the egg raft counts of the mosquito were seen for at least 2 months. Sumithion was also effective to reduce the fly population to about 10% level for 30 days, and the reduction lasted for at least 2 months. It was also effective to the blowfly, but its affection on the mosquito were not clearly demonstrated. In the case of dieldrin treatment, the reductions in the population for all of the three insects were seen in one of the villages while unusual increase after treatment was seen in others.

N2  - The effect of a new organophosphorus insecticide, Sumithion, O, O-dimethyl-O-(3-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)-thiophosphate, to housefly, Musca domestica vicina, and common house mosquito, Culex pipiens, was assessed by several test methods. The LD-50's to adult housefly and mosquito by topical application tests were 0.0653μg per female fly and 0.00195μg per female mosquito, respectively. The LC-50's to larvae and pupae of mosquito by dipping tests were 0.0291ppm and 0.650ppm, respectively. The KT-50's to adult housefly and mosquito by contact tests to the residues of 263mg per square meter treatment were 101 and 75 minutes, respectively. Sumithion was highly effective to housefly and mosquito, especially to the latter, though not so rapid in knockdown to both fly and mosquito.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were carried out to assess the residual effect of 10 insecticides, i.e., lindane, dieldrin, diazinon, malathion, Dibrom, DDVP, Dipterex, ronnel, Baytex, Sumithion to larvae of Culex pipiens using glass vessels. The effective weeks during which 3.2ppm emulsions showed the mortality over 90% were 37 weeks in Sumithion, 31 weeks in ronnel, 33 weeks in Baytex, 19 weeks in diazinon, 33 weeks in lindane, 3 weeks in dieldrin, 5 weeks in Dipterex and DDVP, a week in malathion and less than a week in Dibrom. The persistency index, C_i, was calculated from the following formula : C_i=A/(B_i)×100 A : LC-50 immediately after diluting the emulsifiable concentrate. B_i : LC-50 i weeks after the dilution. The persistency of insecticidal emulsions obtained from the above index descended in the following order : lindane (C_<26> : approximately 40), Baytex, dieldrin and diazinon (C_<39> : 1.5-6), Sumithion and ronnel (C_<37> : 0.4-0.5), Dipterex, DDVP and malathion (C_<9-10> : 0.1-0.3), and Dibrom (C_1 : approximately 0.2).

N2  - For assessing the effect of insecticides to mosquito larvae, the dipping method would widely be adopted. In these tests, the LC-50's of Baytex given in the author's laboratory was extremely diverse; in one case it was approximately 0.2ppm, and in the other case it was 0.002 to 0.004ppm. After some researches aiming the reason, the author was led to the conclusion that chlorine in tap-water used in the tests oxidized Baytex to some materials far less effective than the former compound. The detail will be reported in the near future in English.

During late autumn and early winter of 1961 bitings of bloodthirsty mosquitoes were frequently reported as occurring in large buildings, apartment-houses and individual residences in Tokyo area. 2. It revealed that the breeding sites of these mosquitoes were temporary pools of underground rooms of large buildings and the "reserve filter section" as well as "the disinfectation section" of "septic tanks" for water-closets. 3. The progenies of these mosquitoes produced autogenous eggs. 4. The male phallosome of these mosquitoes represents the characteristic of the autogenous form "molestus" of Culex pipiens, and can be distinguished from that of Culex pipiens pallens, commonly found in Tokyo area.

N2  - This paper deals with the taxonomic characters and the life history of three species of psocid viz., Trogium pulsatorium (L.), Lepinotus reticulatus Enderlein and Tapinella africana Badonnel which were recently collected from stored foods, walls in houses and stored products in warehouses near Tokyo. Tapinella africana Badonnel were taken from dried mushroom for the first time from Japan, and bred on powdered yeast in conical flask plugged with cotton pad at 25±0.5℃ under approximately 76% R. H. Males of this species are completely apterous and the female sex shows an alarly polymorphism, although continual intergrades do not seem to exist between macropterous and micropterous females. Micropterous females have following features : Coloration (especially of vertex, genae, thorax, legs and apex of abdomen) is paler, ocelli are absent or rudimentary and targal lobes are simple or flattened. Various body measurements are given in Table 1. The egg stage lasts about 7 days. Average duration of nymphal life on the powdered yeast is 12.6±0.1 days for males and 17.5±0.9 days for females. There are three moults for males. Adult females, however, undergo six nymphal instars. The eggs are laid singly. Silken threads are never produced by this species.

N2  - Observations were made on the behavior of unengorged female mosquitoes of Culex pipiens s. l. in the laboratory with special reference to the reaction to expired breath and to carbon dioxide. 1. The mosquitoes were released in glass cylinder, 15cm. in diameter and 20cm. in height with glass as the bottom, and the top was covered by a layer of gauze. They were mostly found to stay still on the side wall in the day as well as in the nighttime, but became active twice a day towards sunset and sunrise, and kept to fly around in the container. Such activity were seen either in a room exposed to the sunlight or in a closed chamber under constant illumination. 2. The mosquitoes so far stayed still on the glass wall started to fly immediately after expiration was introduced into the container with a rubber tube. Then, they mostly landed on the gauze surface, walked around and repeatedly stinged the proboscis through the gauze. The rates of mosquitoes thus reacted under various conditions were observed. Such behovior was obviously connected with their blood sucking action, since the rate of mosquitoes which actually bit the human skin through gauze and took the blood meal was much higher in the lots to which expiration was intrduced tran in those which were kept isolated from it. 3. The stinging reaction on the gauze released by introduction of expiration was seen only when the gauze cover was situated towards the top and on the side, but not in the position towards the bottom. Among various materials tested in the place of gauze, the mosquitoes exhibited such stinging reaction only to those surface, such as cloth, screen or sand paper, but not to those with smooth surface like glass. Among the sand papers with various grades of roughness, the rate of reaction was higher as the sand particles became larger. 4. Such effect of the expiration as the stimulant was removed when it was washed with NaOH solution. On the other hand, the effect was released with the air to which 1 to 3 percent of chemically produced carbon dioxide was mixed.

N2  - A study on fleas was carried out in the area during the period from November, 1959 to October, 1960. The host animals were 43 of Apodemus speciosus, 7 of Rattus norvegicus and 1 of Rattus rattus, which had 138 fleas belonging to 5 genera and 5 species. There were more fleas infested per each host lived in the area of the underbrush and the bamboo thicket than in the grass-land. Atyphlhloceras shogakii was collected from Apodemus speciosus. Rhadinopsylla biloba was collected from Apodemus speciosus, which is the first report from the host in Kagoshima Prefecture. Palaeopsylla nippon was collected from Urotrichus talpoides. Nosopsyllus fasciatus and Leptopsylla segnis were collected from Apodemus speciosus, Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus.

N2  - It has been already recognized by the present author (1961) that the knock down effect of insecticide is widely fluctuated under presence of minute moisture and such a phenomenon due to the moisture is the most evident in case of a volatile insecticide, for instance, DDVP or lindane when applied on an absorptive material such as filter paper. In this paper, the relationship between the amount of moisture contained within filter paper to which the insecticide is applied and the environmental humidity was investigated under laboratory condition. For measuring the amount of moisture an electric moisture meter was run. Using house flies the variability of knock down effect of DDVP impregnated papers previously exposed in three different humidities was investigated. Through these experiments, it was confirmed that the relationship between the amount of moisture and relative humidity of the environments showed direct proportion. When the treated surface was exposed under the condition of constant temperature of 25°±1℃ and relative humidity of 27-33 per cent the average moisture value of the filter paper surface was determined to be less than 4 per cent. The time length of exposure in this constant condition did not affect. Under the presence of such minute moisture the knock down effect is invariable. However, in case of a high humidity condition the filter paper moisture increases rapidly; when exposed at a high relative humidity, ranging from 60 per cent to 94 per cent, the moisture of filter paper increases beyond 4 per cent up to 13.3 per cent in accordance with the time of exposure. This results, even a short period exposure to a environmental humidity, caused an instability of knock down effect. It was supposed, that the minute moisture supports the blooming of the insecticide impregnated in the treated material.

N2  - The residual effects of dieldrin, DDT, Baytex and malathion to mosquitoes were assessed using a trap-hut under natural conditions. The hut consisted of an entrance and an exit both irreversible to the insect, and two veneer plates on both sides, each treated with insecticides at the dosage of 2, 500mg/m^2 in DDT or 250mg/m^2 in the other three chemicals. The trap was set to the exit of the hut to capture all the mosquitoes which intended to escape from the hut. Approximate 1kg of dry ice was placed in the hut for attracting mosquitoes. The hut was set in the field from 19 : 00 to 9 : 00 in the next morning. All the mosquitoes both in hut and trap were collected at 9 : 00, and reared in laboratory till 17 : 00 of the day, and the mortality was counted at each time. Total 1, 575 mosquitoes captured by the trap-hut consisted of Culex tritaeniorynchus (71.7%), Culex pipiens (25.8%), Aedes vexans (2.2%) and Anopheles spp.(0.4%). Seventy-one per cent of the mosquitoes which avaded into the hut except those knocked down in the hut, escaped from the exit into the trap by 9 : 00 in the next morning. In these tests, the residues of all of four insecticides lost the effects as early as 2 weeks after the treatment. The effects of Baytex and malathion, though superior to those of dieldrin and DDT in the present tests, were far inferior to the residual effects assessed by 1 hour-contact test in laboratory using C. pipiens.

N2  - In order to check the actual fly control efficiency of the residual insecticide a series of spray tests were carried out utilizing small summer-huts located in a small valley in Hachioji-city west of Tokyo. Using ten huts (each hut has an area of 9.8m^2, and the windows are kept closed throughout the test) spray was made on the ceiling in ratio 50cc per square metre which is the standard dosis in this country. Flies of susceptible as well as resistant strains were introduced at certain intervals during 200 days beginning September 20, 1961, and their knockdown was counted. 1. Residual spray of 5% DDT emulsion gave a knockdown of merely 50% or less when the temperature is high (25-28℃), while it gave about 80% knockdown when the temperature is 20℃ or lower through six months, but never reaches 100%! 2. Residues of 0.5% γ-BHC emulsion gave 70-90% knockdown for about one week after spray against susceptible flies (Takatsuki-strain), but the value comes low down to 50% by one month. A moderately resistant Kamata-strain (resistant ratio about three times of Takatsuki-strain) showed only 15% knockdown by one week and none was affected after one month. 3. It was clearly shown that the knockdown effects of DDT and γ-BHC were always superior in the shadowy huts located among the trees to the same in the huts located in open grassy place. This may be due to the facts that the housefly remains longer on the ceiling in a dark room and the residue does not quickly disappear in the huts among trees where the temperature was kept comparatively low. These conditions naturally accelerate the effect of DDT than the same of γ-BHC. 4. Residue of 0.5% diazinon emulsion showed 100% knockdown effect against susceptible (Takatsuki) strain until 7 days after spray, it fell down to 60% by one month, 0% after six months. When a diazinon resistant strain (RP-strain, resistance 10 times to standard strain) was introduced, it yielded only 16% knockdown even by 7 days, and reached 0% by 20 days!

N2  - Field control tests of larval mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, in ditches by the application of Dibrom, ronnel and Sumithion emulsions were carried out. The application of 0.25ppm of ronnel or Sumithion to the amount of water was practically effective to the larvae; while, in Dibrom 1ppm or more dosage was necessary. Most re-appearance of 1st or 2nd instar larvae occurred 3 days after the application of 0.5ppm of ronnel and 2 days after that of Sumithion.

N2  - Field tests of fly control using Dibrom (1, 2-dibromo-2, 2-dichloroethyl dimethyl phosphate) were carried out during August and September, 1961, in three rural districts of Osaka Prefecture. Paper cords soaked in 0.5% Dibrom emulsion were hanged down from the ceiling of dwellings. In the barns of live stock, 50cc of 0.5% Dibrom emulsion per 3.3m^2 was sprayed on the ceiling and walls. In addition to that, 2 liters of 0.025% Dibrom emulsion per a square meter was sprayed over the floors. These applications were repeated once a week. The results were summarized as follows : The fly population of the dwellings estimated by fly ribbon traps gradually decreased. The residual effect by the soaked cords was supposed to be effective for more than 7 days. The application of 2 liters of 0.025% Dibrom emulsion per a square meter was effective to Sarcophagid fly larvae in latrines, but the larvae started to emerge again in 6 or 8 days after the application.

N2  - Seasonal observation on the occurrence of Drosophila spp. was carried out in Niigata City. Collection was made by banana-trap and 18 species of 4 genera under 2 families were obtained from April to November in 1957. Among them Drosophila auraria, D. immigrance and D. lutea occupied remarkably in number and showed single or double peaks of population. One of the peaks was observed similarly in those three species at the middle of July, and another was at the end of October in D. immigrance and early in November in D. lutea. Most of specimens of other species were captured mainly in the fall. A great occurrences of D. virilis were observed after rainy season of early summer in 1960 and 1961.

N2  - In this report three forms of the simulans-group of the genus Liposcelis were described for the first time in Japan. L. simulans Race A and L. s. Race B were compared with the corresponding British races as described by Broadhead. L. s. Race B seems to be extremely allied to L. terricolis Badonnel. A single female specimen, here treated as L. sp., was found in a case containing dried noodle in Tokyo, and is somewhat allied to L. s. Race B. But the chaetotaxy of the setae on the lateral lobe of pronotum rather resembles to that of L. liparus (Broadhead, 1947), it has a distinct frontal suture and the setae of the abdominal end are shorter.

N2  - In accordance with the facts that some acaroid mites have been reported to breed in certain drug samples in Japan, experiments were made to know the rates of breeding of Tyrophagus dimidiatus in 120 kinds of drugs. Three gramms of each sample was placed in inner vial of a double glass chamber, to which about 300 mites were released and saturated KCl solution was put into the outer vial to regulate the relative humidity at 85%. The vials were kept in an incubator at 25℃, and the number of mites per 0.5gm. of the sample as well as thier rates of survival was observed at the interval of two weeks until the fifteenth week. The results may be summarized as follows. A. Drugs in which remarkable reproduction of more than 500 mites per 0.5gm. was observed are most of the enzyme and protein samples. B. Drugs in which slight reproduction was observed are some of the above kinds of drugs and some tablets and powder drugs containing starch or lactose. C. Drugs in which no reproduction occurred but the survival of placed mites was observed more than two weeks are : most inorganic and organic compounds with no miticidal actions. D. Drugs in which prompt death of the mites was observed are some organic or inorganic compounds presumably with miticidal effects.

N2  - As one of the extensions of our serial study on Japanese B encephalitis started in 1950, we collected mosquitoes from May through September, 1961 mostly at Kurashiki City and a single spot of Okayama City. This year the light trap was improved and a set of home-made saran-wire filter and nylon net was used instead of a cyanide tube in order to obtain alive mosquitoes in good shape. The collection was undertaken 32 times during nights twice a week except on rainy nights. The mosquitoes collected totaled 22, 682 (Kurashiki) and 8, 620 (Okayama) Culex pipiens were found early May being reached the peak population at around the 10th of July coinciding with the time of plentiful rainfall, and decreased gradually with the onset of the hot season. Culex tritaeniorhynchus appeared in the middle of June and the peak population lasted for about a month starting in the middle of July followed by a sudden decrease in number. Anopheles sinensis were not abundant being found from the middle of June through the middle of August, and the peak population was observed between the beginning of July and the middle of August. Eight cases (Kurashiki) and nine cases (Okayama) of Japanese B encephalitis were reported during this summer between the middle of August and the middle of September.

N2  - Comparative effect of ten organophosphorus insecticides, i. e. diazinon, malathion, DDVP, ronnel, Dibrom, Baytex, Acethion, Butonate and Sumithion to a colony of German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., was studied in laboratory conditions. Some chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides were also tested for comparison. After topical application test, DDVP was most effective; Sumithion was the next; and the descending order in the effectiveness was as follows : Dibrom, dieldrin, lindane, Baytex, diazinon, malathion, chlordane, Diepterex, ronnel, Butonate, DDT, Acethion. In rapidity of knockdown assessed by film contact test, DDVP was most excellent; Dibrom was the next; and the descending order in rapidity was as follows : lindane, diazinon, malathion, Sumithion, Baytex, Dipterex, ronnel, dieldrin, chlordane, DDT. The residual effect estimated from the mortality 6 days after the contact for limitted time to the residues kept in room conditions was excellent in Sumithion and Baytex, and inferior in Dibrom, ronnel and Dipterex. Summarizing the data obtained here and in the previous paper by Suzusuki, Shirai and Matsunaga (1961), for the use of residual application to cockroach, dieldrin was most excellent; Sumithion and Baytex were the next; lindane, chlordane and diazinon were the third; and the other chemicals were far inferior to the above chemicals.

N2  - The effects of Dimetilan on normal house flies and Diazinon-resistant house flies were compared with that of Diazinon by Topical Application and Bait Tests. The results obtained by the experiment were as follows : 1) Dimetilan was equally effective against both normal house flies and diazinon-resistant house flies by Topical Application. 2) The cross-resistance of diazinon-resistant house flies was not recognized both in the bait tests of Dimetilan and in the topical application. Dimetilan bait was found effective at such low content of 0.00625%. 3) Sugar bait containing 0.025% Dimetilan was effective for more than one month. 4) Lactose was the most effective material as the basic substance of Dimetilan bait. 5) In the room test of Dimetilan bait, fly population considerably reduced after 24 hours and on the third day it further decreased to one-fourth.

In one of author's experiments, glass tubes of 5cm. in length and 0.4cm. in diameter filled with 0.2ml of 15 percent diazinon and 15 percent DDVP solution in rice oil were attached to each linnen cord of 70cm. in length and 2mm. in diameter. The tubes were suspended from the ceiling at the rate of one per 0.93 square meters. These gave excellent control effects at least for two months after they were installed. In the laboratory experiments, the cords attached to the tubes filled with 5 percent diazinon and 5 percent DDVP solution gave higher knockdown and longer residual effects than those simply impregnated with the same insecticides.

However, in laboratory experiments, the pupae, being 2cm deep in the soil, were perfectly killed by 100- or 200-fold dilution of 15% ethylene-dibromide emulsion.

N2  - Study on distribution of oribatid mites as a vectors of Anoplocephaline cestodes, containing Moniezia expansa, was made. Soil samples were collected in winter at pastures, mainly of livestock breeding farm in each prefecture of Japan. Thirteen families, 19 genera, 31 species and 1877 individuals of oribatid mites were extracted by means of a Tullgren apparatus (Table 1). A naverage, 3.0 species are found in one soil sample and it means that the oribatid fauna of pasture soils are much simple as compaired with woodland one (Fig.1). Scheloribates rigidisetosus Willm. and Trichogalumna lunai Bal. are considered most dominant and show constant number among 41 samples collected. (Table 4 and 5). Their percentage, however, vary considerably in each sample (Fig.2). Scheloribates laevigatus (Koch) comes after them. This species are already known as a vector of Moniezia expansa and a mite of wide distribution. Mites belonging to the family Phthiracaridae may be reduced in pasture soils, while they are more abundant in other circumstances.

N2  - Experimental studies were made to observe the mode of breeding of the common grain mite, Tyrophagus dimidiatus, in various stored food products. Fourty five kinds of samples were kept separately in glass chambers under the temperature of 25℃ and the relative humidity of 75%, in which contain equal amount of the mite samples and the numbers of mite per gramm were counted with the saturated saline floatation method at the interval of a month for three times. At the observation made one month after the start of the cultures, the highest mite count of 34, 000 per gramm was seen in white cheese, which were followed by other cheese samples, dried yeast, laboratory animal food powder, rice bran, various grains, and so on. At the observations of two and three months later, considerable changes in the order of the mite counts were seen by the samples; in "sake-kasu" (rice-wine lees) for example, a retarded breeding of the mite was seen with the highest count of 167, 000 per gram after three months of culture. In most samples, the population were seen to increase by months but in some others the highest population observed at the first or second month.

N2  - The present authors have observed fly larvae discharged from a patient's urethra, who was 26 year old male living at Kumihama-cho, northern Kyoto Prefecture. Of eight larvae in total, three larvae (about 2mm. long) were discharged on August 22nd, two larvae (3.4-4.8mm. long) on 25th, and three larvae (about 10mm. long) on 27th, 1961. Two larvae of the second discharge were estimated as third instar, and were identified as either Sarcophaga septentrionalis or Sarcophaga similis. The infection route was presumable that first instar larvae deposited around dirty penis of the patient invaded through the external urethral orifice into the urethra where they grew up, then they came out three times in the course of their development.

N2  - As a part of the studies on filariasis by members of the Department of Parasitology, the Instute for Infectious Diseases, the University of Tokyo, mosquito surveys were made at the endemic areas of bancroftian filariasis in southern Amami Island during the period of June to October, 1961. A total of 18 species of mosquitoes listed in table 1 were collected from this area. The female mosquitoes collected either by sucking tubes in houses or by light traps were dissected. The positive rates for filarial larvae (all stages included) were 6.4% or 68/1, 059 in Culex pipiens, 0.13% or 1/800 in Culex tritaeniorhynchus and 0.50% or 2/392 in Anopheles hyrcanus and all the other species dissected were negative. The infective stage larvae were recovered from 16 Culex pipiens but not from other species. The infection rates of mosquitoes were much higher in those collected from houses of microfillarial carriers than those in random collections. The densities of mosquitoes and their rates by species were found to differ greatly by the areas surveyed. As the rule, the rates of Culex pipiens among the total collections were higher in urban areas than in the rural villages surrounded by rice fields. As the means of estimating the densities of mosquito breedings in residencial zones, the index was calculated at each community by dividing the number of breeding places of each species by the number of houses, or by dividing the number of positive houses by the total number of houses surveyed.

N2  - To investigate the usefullness of the carbon-dioxide for collecting mosquitoes in field, the mosquito bet nets in which dry-ice was placed were set in the suburbs of Tokyo in summer season of 1961. In one case, up to 5000 female mosquitoes, consisting mainly of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and partly of C. pipiens and Anopheles spp., were collected in a net. Much more mosquitoes were collected by the dry ice trap than by the animal trap using chicken or goat, or by light trap. Dry ice trap adopted in the present study was proved to be highly effective result for collecting the mosquitoes. Diurnal change of prevalence of mosquitoes was also studied using the dry ice trap. The invading number of mosquitoes, both C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. pipiens, appeared to become the peak from 7 : 00 to 8 : 00p.m., and the invasion lasted till 4 : 00 or 5 : 00a.m. in the next morning.

N2  - During a period from April 1959 to March 1960, a seasonal survey of the occurrence of mosquito larvae were conducted in a residential area in Kawasaki City. In total, 7, 617 mosquitoes belonging to seven species, i.e., Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, Ae. vexans, C. tritaeniorhynchus, Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis, C. vorax and C. bitaeniorhynchus, were collected. The most dominant species was C. pipiens, which occupied 94.5% of whole collection. Main breeding sites of C. pipiens were : digged ditches, concrete ditches, night-soil tanks diluted with water and surface waters. As the drainage from dwelling houses pours into the irrigation trenches, C. pipiens larvae were often found even in paddy fields and ponds. Ae. albopictus was found abundantly in grooves of grave stone. The first generation larvae of C. pipiens were found in April, in sheltered places as night soil tank and grassy digged ditch. The peak of the abundance was observed during June-July, but they were recognized until December.

N2  - Field surveys of the injuries due to the cockroaches and ecological statues of them were conducted in the urban area in Kawasaki City, during a period from February 1960 to March 1961. By means of the interview to the inhabitants, it became clear that the cockroaches were established in 98.3% of the surveyed houses, and 76.6% of the inhabitants are suffering from them. An attempt to obtain a correlation existing between the population density of cockroaches and the environmental facters did not yield any promising result. By trap collecting method, three species; Blattella germanica, Periplaneta japonica and P. fuliginosa were collected. B. germanica prevails in restaurant, cabaret and office room, whereas P. japonica and P. fuliginosa were found predominantly in concrete apartment houses and common wooden houses. B. germanica was caught by traps throughout the year. Even in winter, they showed activity in the surroundings of gas ranges and radiators, but were most abundant during the period from July to September. P. japonica and P. fuliginosa were never trapped in an early season from February to March, but were abundant during warmer season from May to August.

N2  - The development and loss of resistance of houseflies to diazinon in Japan was first reported in 1961 by the present author. Further experiments using a number of housefly strains were carried out in the laboratory. The results may be summarized as follows : 1) When topically tested the Hokota population showed a great increase in (LD)_<50>. It raised, after 6 generations, from 0.5836 microgram per a female fly up to 2.5098 microgram, but further pressure gave only a negligible increase even after 15 generations. 2) At the 10th generation of continuous selection the Hamajuku flies showed a (LD)_<50> level of 1.9146 microgram, but further selection gave only slight increase until the F_<15>. 3) A rather diazinon-susceptible strain from Sodegaura was selected. It induced in the second generation a great increase to a plateau of 10 times of that of the normal Takatsuki strain. 4) In the case of Dejima population, a selection for 10 generations did not increase its level by much more than 5 times. 5) In the case of Hikone population, the pressure did not induce any further increase even after 8 generations, but between the F_<10> and F_<15> the resistance was raised sharply to reach a plateau of 55 times the normal. 6) When kept without selection the Hokota and Ibaraki strains which have about 20 times of the resistance as high as the normal lose their resistance gradually reaching the level about 12 times the normal after 20 generations. These results suggest that resistance to diazinon will not disappear rapidly, as mentioned by Keiding (1959).

N2  - In a contact-test to an insecticide film it was known that the knock down effects widely fluctuate under the presence of minute moisture, besides the fact that the effects of moisture is strongly influenced by the nature of surface to which the insecticide is applied. In order to explain such a phenomenon this investigation was carried out using house-flles. It was experimentally confirmed that, when a volatile insecticide such as DDVP, was applied on a glass plate, the residues evaporates rapidly under the presence of minute moisture. In this case, therefore, the knock down effect rapidly disappears. In a case of an absorptive material such as filter paper, the knock down effect under the presence of minute moisture decidedly increase. A consideration of these facts was given in relation to the behaviour of the residues on the treated materials.

N2  - Semi-field and laboratory experiments were conducted to obtain some observations concerning the evaluating methods of house fly population. The number of house flies counted by each evaluating methods such as fly grill, fly paper, fly ribbon and the others was varied by extent of activity of the house flies. The activity, in general, increased at high temperature except at above 30℃. When the number of activated house flies, which recorded in this test, was plotted against the temperature, a straight-line relationship was obtained in 15℃ to 30℃. Old age or starvation has made the flies more active. In a room test, the number of the flies released in the room, vs, the number of the flies which alighted on some surface, did not generally give a straight-line relationship. This was ascertained on the index of the fly grill and fly paper. These results indicated that the counts of house flies obtained from each evaluating methods were influenced by temperature, stage and feeding or starvation of the house flies. It was generally observed in rooms that house flies, which decreased activity in some condition, would choice the resting place on the ceiling or on side of the walls. On the other hand, activated flies have alighted on the floor and concentrated in a center of the room. From this observation, house flies which alighted on the fly grill or on the fly paper placed on the floor, would increase in numbers as temperature increased, and decreased at low temperatures. When various numbers of flies were releaced in a room, the index of the flies of the fly paper was essentially similar to that of the fly grill. The index of the fly grill has more fluctuated than that of the fly paper.

N2  - 1) Objective investigation on the density of fly population was very difficult, because the flies showed excellent fecundity and extensive dispersion. The method taken in the present papar was the one for evaluating the effectiveness of insecticides in field and was to compare with the effectivenss of insecticides before and after application. Evaluation of insecticides in field was desirable for simple and stable method to decrease error caused by apparatus and investigators. 2) Up to the present, the effectiveness of insecticides for flies in field was evaluated by fly trap, fly ribbon and fly grill. However, these had merits and dermits. Of couse, the method with combination of several ones was desirable from the point of ideal view. But, the method by fly ribbon and fly grill were concluded to be useful from the point of practical view. 3) In case of extensive appication of insecticides in field, it was better to evaluate with the method avaraging numerical values. When evaluation of the effectiveness was compared with others in limited area, it was better to pick out numerical value that might represent fly population and that should be a value above the average. 4) In the case of a release study of the dispersion of house fly, the number of flies on fly ribbon indicated the proportional relation with the number of emergence.

Diploneura (Diploneura) peregrina (Wiedemann, 1830) 3. Aneurina unispinosa (Zetterstedt, 1860) 4. Stichillus matsumurai Schmitz, 1952 5. Conicera (Tritoconicera) breviciliata Schmitz, 1926 6. Megaselia (Aphiochaeta) spiracularis Schmitz, 1938 Of these, the male of Stichillus matsumurai was described for the first time by the authors, although the female had been described by Schmitz previously. Aneurina unispinosa was found in Hokkaido for the first time in Japan. Diploneura cornuta and Megaselia spiracularis are very common species in Japan, and Diploneura peregrina and Conicera breviciliata are commonly found in Tokyo. Keys to subfamilies and important genera of Phoridae are also given in this paper.

N2  - The entrance and exit of the house flies in a residence of Yokohama city, Japan, was observed by the mark and release method. The house flies resting on the ceiling of this residence at night were collected and were used for the experiment. It seems that all the house flies in the house were caught by this method. The flies marked on the scutum with the colour paints, white, yellow and blue, were released over three days. After the release, the remaining marked flies and the newly invaded ones were counted on the ceiling at nights on succeeding days. As shown in Table 2, the released flies remained the period of four to seven days, and they showed the decrease of 30〜72% of the numbers of the previous night. It was observed that some flies once disappeared appeared again the next night.

N2  - Mosquitoes were collected in the dwellings at Tomatsuri from June to September in 1948, at Wakakusa from July to September in the same year, and at Kanuma from July to October in 1951. 1) Mosquitoes of four genera and six species were observed in these three places. The species of mosquitoes found in each places. The species of mosquitoes found in each place was almost similar to one another. These mosquitoes were constituted from an overwhelmingly great number of Culex pipiens and a small number of Anopheles sinensis, Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex bitaeniorhynchus. 2) The most important species that commanded the seasonal occurrence of mosquitoes in the dwellings was C. pipiens. This species appeared in small numbers in the middle of June and reached the highest population in the middle of July. Then, they decreased gradually in number and became still fewer in August and September. After October they could not be found at all.

N2  - Observation on the successions of larvae and pupae of mosquitoes breeding in basins for holy water hollowed on gravestones surrounded by bamboo groves were carried out in Kyoto from January to December, 1957. 946 individuals belonging to 4 genera including 6 species were collected, of which Aedes japonicus (30.7%), Aedes flavopictus (26.0%) and Uranotaenia bimaculata (24.5%) were large in number, Aedes albopictus (15.1%) was next to them, and Tripteroides bambusa (3.3%) and Armigeres subalbatus (0.4%) were rather rare. The seasonal prevalences of these species are shown in Fig. 1. Aedes japonicus and Uranotaenia bimaculata appeared all the year around and the former was dominant from October to early in May. Aedes flavopictus, Aedes albopictus and Tripteroides bambusa appeared from spring to autumn and Aedes flavopictus was dominant in summer.

N2  - Experiments were made to observe the effects of environmental humidity and of the moisture contents of various stored food products on the breeding of the grain mite, Tyrophagus dimidiatus. The humidity was regulated by keeping the materials in glass vials containing saturated solutions of various salts, such as K_2CO_3 (46% R.H.), CaCl_2 (53% R.H.), NaCl (70% R.H.), NaNO_3 (77% R.H.) and of water (95% R.H.). All experiments were made at 25℃. Using powdered materials as the food for the mites and relatively low moisture contents, such as laboratory animal food (6.6% water content), shichimipepper (8.8%) or dried yeast (4.4%), breeding of the mites shows the best condition at the highest humidity of 95% R.H. With the dried and sliced fishmeal (kezuribushi), which water content rapidly balances with the relative humidity of the environment, the best breeding of the mites were seen at 85 to 75% R.H. In the case of rice which contained 15.0% of water, less effects of the relative humidiy were seen both on the growth of the mites and on changes of water contents. Water contents of the materials to be tested were also found to affect the breeding of the mites. Both in powdered laboratory animal food in dried yeast, the optimum water content for the growth of the mites was seen at 17.7% and 16.6% respectively, and their breeding seemed to be interfered as it became either lower or higher from the level. By using dried yeast, powder milk and skim milk as the material, experiments were designed to observe the speed of breedings of the mites in the food containing different grades of water contents and kept at different relative humidities. In the initial few weeks, the best breeding was seen in lots with low moisture contents and kept at high relative humidities as well as in those with 18.0% water content and kept at 75% R.H. In the later stages after several weeks, the highest mite counts were seen in those kept at 75% R.H. indifferent from the initial water contents of the foods. Although their relative effects seem to differ greatly by the nature of the food to be tested, through these experiments, it has been demonstrated that both relative humidity of the environment and the moisture content of the materials are the essential factors for the breeding of the mites. For the purpose of preventing the stored food products and some drugs from breeding of the mites, either dessication of the materials or the storage at low humidity was found to be the effective measure.

N2  - The experiments have been carried out to examine the effect of attractive slug killers containing metaldehyde. The slugs, Limax flavus L. used in this experiment were collected from the houses. Ten grammes of test chemical were set at the corner of 4 meters diametric circles each, and the following results were obtained. 1) Metaldehyde was proved highly attractive to slug. In case that the attractive slug killer was continuously applied for one week, the following effects for the slugs were got. Metaldehyde content The attractivity ratio 0.1% about 10% 0.5% about 30% 5.0% about 60% 2) Auxiliary materials such as rice-bran, wheat flour and sugar added to metaldehyde were not so influencial on the effect of attractive power. 3) The mortality ratio did not increased by mixing lindane, dieldrin, sodium pentachlorophenate, calcium arsenate, or diazinon with metaldehyde. 4) Metaldehyde had the ability to attract the slugs within 2 meters around. The most effective method was using the chemical in a small lump. On basing the above informations, the field examination was done for one week at Yoshizuka, Fukuoka city as follows : The lump of 10 grams attractive slug killer (3% of metaldehyde content) was set at the side of water way in kitchen. The slugs attracted were found dead or anesthetic within 50cm diametric circle. The most of slugs obtained were Limax flavus L. and a few of Jucilaria confusa Cockerell. The slugs got were totally 1, 410, and were 21 per house. By this examination, the attractive slug killer containing metaldehyde was proved to be highly effective in practical use.

N2  - Usually a poisonous bait for rat control is prepared with as large amount of poison as to kill a rat, even if a rat eats a part of the bait. However, in some cases, rats show a shyness of the bait so prepared, and also the bait is highly toxic to other animals. This study was made for the purpose to increase the rodenticidal effect of the bait by reducing the amount of poison, thallium sulphate, in each bait and increasing the bait consumptions of laboratory white mouse. Favourable results were obtaind by the use of bait containing 0.12% of thallium sulphate.

N2  - Control tests of the diazinon-resistant house fly were conducted during 28 May to 30 July, 1961, in Mihara area of Hokota Village, Ibaraki Prefecture. The results are summarized as follows : 0.5% diazinon emulsion, 0.5% Nankor emulsion and 0.3% Dipterex・0.2% DDVP emulsion were treated as residual sprays in 3 areas where diazinon had been heavily applied in the previous year. In the cases of Nankor and a mixture of Dipterex and DDVP, the fly population estimated by ribbon traps decreased markedly through the period of the experiment. On the other hand, the effect of diazinon was rather unsatisfactory. Dimethylan bait gave satisfactory control effect against the diazinon-resistant fly for more than 15 days.

N2  - In the case of epidemic of poliomyelitis in Ooyubari, Hokkaido, Japan in 1960, the authors had an opportunity to survey the occurrence of poliomyelitis viruses in flies. The results of the survey are reported in this paper. The first case of poliomyelitis patient of this area occurred during the month of April, 1960. During this year, thirty three cases were observed in total population of approximately 16, 000. Since 1955, the fly control operation have continued in this area, and then fly population seemed to be lower than the other areas. In June 29 and 30, just after the peak of occurrence of poliomyelitis cases, the fly collection was carried out. Flies were collected by two methods, netting and baited trapping. The sweeping by net was made over garbage, fish-boxes of fishmonger, privies and the other sites where flies had gathered. Flies collected by net, were poured out into the NaCN killing bottle. For trapping, some cage traps were set over garbage and some others provided with fish baits were hung from the bar in front of the residence. Captured flies were immobilized by chloroform, and killed in the NaCN bottle. After the identification of flies, they were placed in a jar with dry ice, and were sent to the laboratory in Tokyo, where they are kept in a deepfreezer until test. The species and the number of the flies are shown in Table 1. Of 805 individuals of the flies collected, 233 individuals belong to 7 genera and probably more than 7 species were tested for isolation of poliomyelitis viruses. Each sample contains 20 flies or less, and YLE solution was added to it in a rate of 0.5 ml per fly, then it was homogenized in a blender. After the refrigeration, the crude suspension was spun, the sediment discarded. To each 1 ml of supernate, there was added 500 units of penicillin, 500γ of streptomycin and 10γ of aureomycin solution. Tube cultures of HeLa cell were used. To each culture tube, 0.2ml of the inoculum and 0.8ml of YLE solution containing 5% horse serum were added. They were incubated at 37℃ for 7 days. Three passages were carried out every 7 days. Of 14 test samples, 3 proved positive for poliomyelitis virus, which belongs to the type 1. Poliovirus was proved only from samples of Phaenicia sericata. Each 2 tubes out of 7 tubes constituted with one unit sample, in these 3 positive cases, showed cytopathogenic phenomena after 5〜7 days of the inoculation in first generation.

N2  - An investigation on the trombiculid mites in the area was carried out during the period from November, 1959 to October, 1960. Numbers of host animals of the trombiculid mites were 307 of Apodemus speciosus, 12 of Microtus montebelli, 4 of Urotrichus talpoides, 21 of Rattus norvegicus, 1 of Rattus rattus and 8 bird. 11, 691 trombiculid mites were collected, which belong to 6 genera including 15 species. Apodemus speciosus was infested by the most parasites. There were more mites infested per each hosts lived in the area of the underbrush and the bamboo thicket than in the grass-land. Trombicula fuji, T. kitasatoi, T. kuroshio and Gahrliepia saduski were collected in every month of the year. The most dominant species is T. pallida, of which nevertheless none was collected in August. T. hazatoi was collected from Apodemus speciosus, which is the first report from the host.

N2  - The oxygen consumption of house-fly, Musca domestica vicina, was measured by Warburg's constant volume respirometer. The living flies of several stages such as adult, pupa, larva and egg put in the flask of respirometer were observed in natural condition. The temperature measured was at 40℃, 30℃, 25℃, 20℃ and 10℃ respectively. The results experimented were summarized as follows : 1) It was recognized that any stage of houseflies needed oxygen in the air. However, the oxygen consumption varied considerably according to the developmental stage of the fly as indicated in Figure 1 and 2. The active stages such as larva and adult consumed oxygen more than nonactive stages such as egg and pupa. 2) In any cases, flies needed more oxygen under higher temperature, but the quantity of oxygen decreased with the decline of temperature.

N2  - It has been known, as an actual phenomenon, that during a contact-test on an insecticide film the KT_<50> values (the measurement of insecticidal potency to test insects) often unexpectedly fluctuated. Using house flies an investigation was attempted on this phenomenon. It was experimentally confirmed that test insects are more susceptible to insecticide residues when its treated surface contains a minute amount of moisture. The relationship between the KT_<50> values and the amount of the moisture showed an inverse correlation. Such an instability of knock down effect due to the moisture, is the most evident in both cases of DDVP and Dibrom regardless the formulation of the insecticide when applied on absorptive materials such as filter paper or veneer plate. If applied on a glass plate, however, similar effect was not recognized.

N2  - Field tests of fly control using Nankor^[○!R] (0, 0-dimethyl 0-2, 4, 5-trichlorophenyl phosphorothioate) were carried out from 21 Sept. to 21 Oct., 1960, in a rural district in Mino, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The results were summarized as follows : By the spray of 200cc of 0.5% kerosene solution of Nankor per 33m^2 in the dwellings or 100cc of 0.5% emulsion of Nankor per a square meter in the barns of the live-stock, the fly population estimated by using fly ribbons was decreased remarkably and the effect of Nankor lasted for 7 days. On the second time (7 Oct.), the fly control was done by renewing of litter and the spraying in the barns of the live-stock. As the result, the fly population in the dwellings was gradually decreased and its effect lasted for 7 days. The application of 2 liters of 0.025% emulsion of Nankor per a square meter was effective to fly larvae in latrines, but the larvae emerged again in 11 days after the application.

N2  - The increase of insecticidal effect by mixture of two organophosphorus insecticides especially of DDVP and other chemicals, was investigated by topical application method using Takatsuki strain of house fly, Musca domestica vicina. The effect of diazinon, malathion and Nankor was fairly improved by mixing with DDVP. The increase of the effect was remarkable in the mixture of Nankor and DDVP. The mixture of ratio of diazinon 2 and DDVP 8, malathion 2 and DDVP 8, and Nankor 5 and DDVP 5 was more effective than the sole DDVP. In all the combinations in the mixture of DDVP and the other chemicals, it seemed that as the content of diazinon, malathion or Nankor decreased the mixtures became more effective. The mixture of diazinon and malathion was more effective than the sole malathion and less than the sole diazinon. Any remarkable increase in the effect was not given by DDVP to Baytex or Dipterex.

N2  - Late in 1960, diazinon-resistant houseflies were discovered in two coastal areas of Sodegaura Village, Chiba Prefecture (Fig. A and B). Laboratory tests of adult flies collected from 11 areas in Sodegaura and Obitsu, where diazinon had been applied as a residual spray for 3 or 4 years, were conducted during an early season of 1961. On topical application, adult flies from 6 areas of Sodegaura showed LD_<50> values 10-20 times that of the normal Takatsuki strain to diazinon. Flies from coastal area (A〜F) were even more resistant to diazinon than those from inner areas (G〜J). Even with the house fly, 4 years of heavily residual spraying at Sueyoshi area, Obitsu Village, induced only five-fold tolerance to diazinon. Several organophosphorus insecticides, i.e. Nankor, Dipterex and Baytex, were treated as residual sprays in 6 areas where house flies have developed resistance to diazinon. The population densities estimated by ribbon traps lowered considerably through the period of the experiment. Effect of diazinon still remained for 15 days or more in Sueyoshi area, Obitsu Village, where the resistance ratio of flies to Takatsuki strain was only five-fold.

N2  - Cockroach control tests in apartment houses were done. In the apartment houses in Fukuoka area, only the cockroach, Periplaneta fuliginosa Serville, was found and no other species was observed. Ten or twenty times dilution of 5% emulsifiable and mixed emulsifiable concentrate 4% dieldrin with 6% lindane were sprayed at the rate of 40cc per m^2 in kitchens and lumber rooms. By a residual spraying on lower walls of the rooms, the roach was fairly controlled. By twice treatments in May and September, the roach was almost exterminated. In this case, the time of the treatments was decided in accordance with seasonal occurrence of the cockroach. On the distribution of roaches in apartment houses in this area, the following characteristics were observed. That is, on the vertical distribution, the adults and larvae were mainly found at the 4th floor (highest floor), and at the 1st floor as next. In the horizontal distribution, the roach was mainly inhabited at the central part. It was also observed that the peaks of occurrence of roaches were observed in August and September. In the restaurants, German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., was found more than any other species, and P. fuliginosa and P. americana L. were also found but very fewer than B. germanica. According to the LD-50 test by topical application method against those cockroaches both collected and bred, the following results were observed. Some colonies of B. germanica showed slightly resistance to lindane, but none of them showed the resistance to dieldrin. Against organophosphorus insecticides, the roaches were as susceptible as the normal strain. For the control of German roach in restaurants, approximately 2.5-fold dosage per unit area of the chemicals (dieldrin 4% E. C or dieldrin 4% and lindane 6% mixed E. C.) was required. This may be ascribed to the complicated structure of the restaurants. The treatment of DDVP by fog machine was ineffective, and also the residual spraying of diazinon E. C. to lower walls of rooms was not enough to control the pest. It was confirmed that effective control was given by the treatment of dieldrin which was remarkably stable and then persistent for a long time. According to the results as stated above, it is considered that the treatment of residual spraying to lower walls in the rooms using organic chlorinated insecticides, i.e. dieldrin E. C. or mixed E. C. of dieldrin and lindane, is the most effective and standard method for cockroach control in the present status.

N2  - Residual effect of dieldrin, lindane, chlordane, diazinon and DDVP to female German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., was estimated by contact with the residues of 50cc of 5% xylene solution per square meter for 2 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours or 24 hours. The knockdown percentage was counted 6 days after the contact. The most effective insecticide was dieldrin, and the effectiveness descended in the following order : lindane, diazinon, chlordane, DDVP. For an example, the effective period after an-hour-contact to the residues was as follows : dieldrin, 29 weeks; lindane, 3-6 weeks; diazinon, 3 weeks; chlordane, 1 week; DDVP, less than a day.

N2  - After the treatment of insecticides to female cockroaches, Blattella germanica L., by contact method, topical application method and injection method, observations were made on the dropping of egg capsules, the hatching rate of the eggs and the mortality of their lst stage nymphs. All capsules were dropped after knockdown of the maternal roaches by the treatments of dieldrin, chlordane, diazinon, DDVP and dibrom. Though the knockdown time of the roaches treated with dieldrin and chlordane was nearly equivalent, the time of dropping of egg capsules was faster in dieldrin than in chlordane. This may be ascribed to the difference of insecticidal mechanism in these two chemicals. Hatching of the eggs laid by the roaches treated with the above mentioned five chemicals were seen only within 5 to 10 days after their capsules dropped, but no hatching was seen later. The nymphs from the roaches treated with DDVP and dibrom survived normally, and those from the roaches treated with diazinon, chlordane and dieldrin took two courses : the one died within 4 days entirely or partly after hatching and the other survived normally.

N2  - In Korea, Dr. Harujiro Kobayashi and Dr. Katsushige Hori have classified Korean flies into 6 families, 17 genera and 45 species before World War II. Since then no further works on the family have been done in Korea. During the period from April of 1959 to September of 1960, Park had made an intensive collection of flies in the Taegu area which amounted to 4844 specimens of Sarcophagidae. A close examination of the specimens revealed that 3 species of Sarcophaga were new and 10 species were hitherto unreported from Korea. The authors will describe one of these new species in the present paper.

N2  - In August, 1957, the writer made the investigation on the mosquito larvae in the 'Mosochiku' bamboo stumps, the split 'Mosochiku' bamboos and the 'Madake' bamboo stumps in and around Utsunomiya. 1. From the 'Mosochiku' stumps, 1, 050 larvae belonging to three genera and five species were collected. Of these, Aedes flavopictus was the largest in unmber, 53.4% of the total larvae, Tripteroides bambusa 33.7%, Armigeres subalbatus and Ae. albopictus was few, and Ae. japonicus was the least. 2. Many larvae were found in the split bamboos and 863 larvae blonging to three genera and four species were collected from three split 'Mosochiku' bamboos. Of these, Ae. flavopicus was the largest in number, 36.6% of the total. Ar. subalbatus followed it, and Ae. albopictus and Tr. bambusa were collected few. 3. The larval fauna of the mosquitoes in the 'Madake' bamboo stumps was poor, and the number of species and individuals was by far smaller than that in the 'Mosochiku' bamboo stumps. 4. 12 kinds and 86 larval associations were formed in the 'Mosochiku' stumps. Of these, Ae. flavopictus associations and Tr. bambusa-Ae. flavopictus associations were the largest in number. Seven kinds and 13 larval associations were formed in the split 'Mosochiku' bamboos. Of these, Ae. flavopictus-Ar. subalbatus associations and Ae. flavopictus-Ae. albopictus-Ar. subalbatus associations were the largest in number. Four kinds and 22 associations were formed in 'Madake' bamboo stumps. Of these, Ae. flavopictus-Ae. albopictus associations were the largest in number. 5. The phenomenon of "habitat segregation" between Ae. flavopictus and Ae. albopictus was not found out in the present investigation on the 'Mosochiku' stumps, the split 'Mosochiku' and the 'Madake' stumps just as in the previous reports.

N2  - In late 1960 and early 1961, increased dosages and resprayings of diazinon failed to kill the house flies in several localities of Ibaragi and Chiba Prefectures. Collections were made subsequently, from ten of these localities in order to carry out a comparison with the normal Takatsuki or the resistant RP strain of houseflies. 1. As regards the development of resistance to diazinon the results of the experiments in the laboratory can be summarized as follows : On topical application, flies from Mihara in Hokota, Obata in Ibaragi and Hamajuku in Sodegaura showed an increased (LD)_<50> values, 10-20 times, that of Takatsuki strain. A 10-fold increase in resistance could be sufficient to invalidate organophosphorus compound as residual spray (as described by Keiding in 1956). At the 5 or 6th generation of further selection with diazinon these resistant flies in the laboratory had become 2 or 4 times as diazinon resistant as the populations originated. On the other hand the Hikone population, which was highly resistant to chlorinated hydrocarbons, gained only 2-fold tolerance to diazinon after 8 generations of diazinon-pressure. Hokota flies at the F_6 under diazinon-pressure showed resistance level about 100 times of the normal (Takatsuki) strain to diazinon. Houseflies taken early in 1961 from Kamigo district, Dejima Village in Ibaragi Prefecture, which had been treated with diazinon for one year, proved to be 4.7 times as resistant as the population in 1960. Another collection in 1960 from Sueyoshi district, Obitsu Village in Chiba Prefecture, which had been treated with diazinon during 1958-60, showed a 8-fold resistance. 2. The RP strain when kept in laboratory-showed no decrease of resistance even after 46 generations. Although flies taken from Hokota and Ibaragi and bred for five generations without further exposure to diazinon showed a slight fall in the levels of diazinon resistance, they were still considerably resistant to this insecticide. 3. These resistant houseflies showed resistance levels of from 10 to 20 times of the normal ones against diazinon, but only of 2-4 times of the normal to the other insecticides, i.e. DDVP, malathion, Nankor and Baytex.

N2  - Since the Kii-type of the Trombiculid mite, T. mitamurai, the distribution of which has hitherto been considered to be isolated in the southern part of the Kii Peninsula, was collected in the basin along Gokase River of Miyazaki Prefecture in 1959, the authors have made a study on specimens of T. mitamurai collected in this prefecture in the past several years and found that the both types, Kii-type as well as Hiroshima-type, are distributed in several places. According to the results of collection, the majority of the Kii-type have been recovered from Urotrichus talpoides and in comparison with the Hiroshima-type the scope of the host appears to be narrow. Also, the Kii-type was collected from forest but not from field and residential section. As compared with the Kii-type obtained in Kii, no difference was obtained generally in sizes of scutum. Some consideration has been made on the distribution of the Kii-type in Miyazaki Prefecture, but a satisfactory explanation on the geographical distribution, variation and so on will depend a great deal upon the future studies.

N2  - During the period from May to November, 1957, the writer investigated twenty-four times on thirty stumps of bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides Sieb. et Zucc.) in a bamboo grove in Utsunomiya City. 1. The mosquito larvae collected were of only two species : Aedes flavopictus (85.3%) and Aedes albopictus (14.7%). 2. Ae. flavopictus always appeared dominant and reached their maximum number at the end of August. Ae. albopictus reached their maximum number in the middle and end of August. The former disappeared at the end of October, while the latter at the biginning of the same month. 3. In the bamboo stumps there were formed only three kinds of larval associations : Ae. flavopictus association (73.7%), Ae. flavopictus-Ae. albopictus association (15.8%) and Ae. alvopictus association (10.5%). 4. There was not seen the phenomenon of "habitat segregation" between Ae. flavopictus and Ae. albopictus in the bamboo stumps. 5. Compared with larval fauna of the mosquitoes in the stumps of another kind of bamboo (Mosochiku) formerly reported by the writer, in the present case the results were very poor, i. e. much smaller in number of species and individuals.

N2  - Males, females and larvae of certain stage of German and American cockroaches were brought into contact with filter paper treated by 5% lindane, 5% chlordane and 5% dieldrin xylene solution at rate of 50cc per m^2, and the knokdown percentage of the roaches was recorded. After the results, younger stage of the larvae was more susceptible than that of the older ones, though the adult of males gave higher knockdown percentages than the old or last instar larvae. The susceptibility of German and American roaches of the same body weight was nearly in the same level to lindane or dieldrin. To chlordane German roaches were more tolerant than American ones. With the ten-fold increase of the body weight in the larval German and American roaches, the LT-50's increase 2.5 and 2.5 times with lindane, 1.9 and 2.0 times with chlordane and 2.0 and 4.0 times with dieldrin, respectively.

N2  - In order to know the contact toxicity of various insecticides against caterpillars of the Far Eastern urticating moth, Euproctis flava Bremer, a study was carried out in the laboratory. Six insecticides, γ-BHC (lindane), tech.-DDT, dieldrin, diazinon, DDVP and allethrin were tested through topical application method using a tubelculin syring. It was confirmed that the two organophosphorus insecticides were more effective than all the others, and allethrin was next. Dieldrin showed nearly equivalent effectiveness as γ-BAC. It was farther confirmed by using micrometer syringe that the γ-BHC is superior to DDT, and the LD-50 value of tec.-DDT is about five times to LD-50 of γ-BHC, when those were tested against the last instar caterpillars. In an incidental test, the toxic effect of Lead arsenate used as stomach poison was preliminarily estimated.

N2  - The effect of Dibrom, or dimethyl 1, 2-dibromo-2, 2-dichloroethyl phosphate, to house flies was compared with DDVP and diazinon by laboratory and field tests. The LD-50 of Dibrom to Takatsuki strain of house flies was 0.023_γ per female fly, thus showing more effective than DDVP or diazinon which gave the LD-50's of 0.034_γ and 0.072_γ, respectively. After the results of knockdown tests by several methods, Dibrom gave the most rapid effect under open conditions, while DDVP gave the most rapid one under closed conditions, perhaps by reason of higher volatility of DDVP. In residual effect, DDVP was the lowest, and Dibrom was in the same level with or rather superior to diazinon. After the field tests, the residual spray of Dibrom was effective so long as 15 days to house flies.

N2  - A field control test of adult and larval flies by the application of Nankor, or O, O-dimethyl 0-2, 4, 5-trichlorophenyl phosphorothioate, was carried out from August to September, 1960. Either 0.5% kerosene solution of Nankor was sprayed on the ceiling and walls of dwellings and cattle sheds, or 1% solution was applied as aerosol. This was repeted at intervals of 10, 14 or 20 days. On the other hand, 0.025% Nankor emulsion was sprayed on the floors of cattle sheds at rate of 1l/m^2, and in the latrins 2l/m^2, both once a week. As the synerthetic effect of these treatment, the population of house flies remarkably decreased from 15 to 20 days after the first application. This was more remarkable in cattle sheds than in human dwellings. The decrease was suposed to be attributed mainly to the effect of larvicide applied on the floors of cattle sheds. To the lavae in latrins, the application of 0.025 to 0.05% Nankor emulsion at rate of 1l/m^2 once a week was effective. However, as the larvae reappear after 4 to 7 days, the application should be repeted at intervals of 7 or 10 days for practical control.

N2  - Last year the author had an opportunity to make a short trip to Tsushima, Nagasaki-ken. Very little is known about the flea-fauna of this island although the other fauna such as mammal-, bird-, and winged insect-, had been fairly well investigated by many authors. Tsushima is located between Kyusyu and Korea. The mammal-fauna had been discussed by Thomas (1908), Kuroda (1920), Kishida (1925) and Tokuda (1941) from the zoogeographical view point. As all the above mammalogists insist, as for the similarities of its fauna among the adjacent lands, it has more elements in Kyushu than in Korea. The present brief report will endorse moreover such interpretation from the side of the parasite-fauna.

N2  - Even for the past few decades, many cases of disagreeable dermatitis caused by contact with hairy caterpillars have been reported from various parts of this country. These insects are taxonomically well known and their life histories were also made known. However, besides nettling hairs of certain species, only little information is available in regard to the structure and sting mechanism of the larval poison hairs. Being enabled to collect a number of materials, it has recently been confirmed that some caterpillars belonging to Zygaenidae, Arctiidae and Lymantriidae also possess poison hairs of characteristic shape and function, quite similar to those of Artona funeralis Butler, which was reported in my previous paper. This paper deals with the morphology of these poison hairs, together with the dermatitis experimentally caused by them. My sincere thanks are due to Dr. Syoziro Asahina, Chief of the Department of Medical Entomology, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, for his valuable advices and kind criticism given during the course of this study. I am also deeply indebted to Mr. Ryonosuke Koyama, Forest Protection Division, Government Forest Experiment Station, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Dr. Kazuo Saitoh, Biological Institute, Faculty of Literature and Science, Hirosaki University, for the gift of the specimens of Illiberis psychina, Illiberis pruni and Lymantria dispar.

N2  - A series of observations on the life history of Artona funeralis (Butler) was carried out under the condition in the out-door insectarium as well as in the fields about Kyoto during two years. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) Three generations were performed through one year-round, and overwintering was carried out as the pupal stage. 2) Overwintering pupal generation emerged and oviposited during the period from mid May to mid June. 3) First generation performed during the period from late May to mid July, and second generation from mid July to early September. Larvae of third generation reached pupal stage at late October and entered into hibernaton. 4) Larval stage was completed through five instars, and the average duration of larval period in each generation was 30, 28, 40 days for the first, second and the third generation, respectively. 5) Longevity in adult stage was 1-6 days for female, and 1-9 days for male, the mean of which was 3.5, 4.0 days, respectively. 6) The average duration of the period performed in cocoon was 12, 12, 187 days for the first, second and the third generation, respectively. 7) Rate of hatching was 85%, 80%, 80%, that of pupation was 55%, 65%, 58%, and that of emergence was 48%, 56%, 12%, for the first, second and the third generation, respectively. 8) As a rule, adult females copulated after the lapse of one day from emergence and the oviposited usually at the next day of copulation. 9) Cocoons were composed of waxy substance, dark brown in color, ellipsoid in shape, and found usually under or inside of decayed bamboo or tree stems. 10) It was ascertained by a rearing experiment that females oviposited not only on bamboo leaves, but also on leaves of rice plants, and larvae derived from the either case showed no actual difference in development.

N2  - A release study of the dispersion of the house fly, Musca domestica vicina, and the blow fly, Phaenicia spp. was conducted in the suburbs of Kawasaki city, near Tokyo, during September and October, 1959. The area selected for the purpose is considered to be typical suburbs of Japanese town which consists of farms and scattered residential areas. The flies used for release were obtained by netting wild adult flies at the site selected as the release point. The captured flies were fed for approximately 24 hours on the milk containing the radioactive phosphorus at the rate of 1 mc of radioactive material per 1l milk. The concentration used was confirmed by the laboratory investigation to be satisfactory for this test. Radioactive marked flies were released on the evening, when it become too dark for them to migrate. In order to recover the released flies, fly catch ribbons, fly catch papers and cage traps were used. Traps were set in thiry nine houses (except cage traps in twenty ones) within a area of 1, 000m radius from the release point. Trapped flies were examined for five times during a period of twenty three days after the release, the flies were divided by geiger counter to tagged and untagged ones. During the recovery operation, 28, 435 flies in total, were collected, the majority of them was found to be the house fly (68.6%) and blow fly (20.8%). Of 14, 250 marked house flies and 600 marked blow flies released, 456 (3.2%) and 25 (4.2%) flies were recovered by the traps, respectively. Of 456 radioactive tagged house flies, 347 (76.0%) and 454 (99.4%) were recovered at the release point and within a circle of 100m, respectively. Otherwise, each only one was trapped on the distance of 400 and 500m from the release point. In case of the blow flies, of 25 marked flies, 4 (16.0%) and 24 (96.0%) were recovered at release site and within a circle of 100m, respectively. Only a single fly was trapped on the distance of 700m. Because the density of trap was not the same for each trap-set distance, the number of recovered flies does not rightly represent the pattern of dispersion. Nevertheless, the result above stated would tell a tendency that large number of flies has moved within a circle of 100m from the release point. As shown in Fig.1, there are, adjacent to the release site, paddy field of 250m in width to the north, and a hill range of 20-30m in height to the south. To east and west, however, a high way runs. The fact that the majority of tagged flies recovered in the east and west directions would indicate that the dispersion was influenced strongly by the topographical condition. The daily change of the percent of marked flies recaptured at and near the release point is shown in Table 6. This result indicates that the decrease of recovery percent is abrupt at release site, becoming slowly at the adjacent sites.

N2  - Five wrong names of Japanese cockroaches of sanitary importance were corrected. Two misidentified names, "Blatta concinna" and "Blatta orientalis" were dropped from our indigenous species-list. A more detailed discussion of Japanese cockroaches of house-hold importance will be published elsewhere in a future occasion.

N2  - There was a great occurrence of Drosophila virilis after the rainy season of 1960 in the neighborhood of a lumberyard in Niigata City. Great number of flies entered into human dwellings and afflicted the people. We found many larvae and pupae under the bark of Siberian spruce, fir trees, larch and white birch which had been landed and stored in the lumberyard. The distribution and population density of the adults were examined by means of the fly catch ribbon, and the results are summarized in Table 1. Number of flies captured within 200m from the lumberyard is greater than that of flies captured in the distance of more than 200m away from the lumberyard. DDVP (0.3% kerosene solution) and BHC (1.5% powder) were spreaded directly on their habitat and only DDVP was fogged in rooms of human dwellings. The results are summarized in Table 2. The decrease of the adults might be seen in the house where DDVP was fogged. It is difficult to estimate the actual effect of insecticides, however, we have only described hereby the results obtained.

N2  - A trial for the control by means of aerial application of insecticide against caterpillars of the Far Eastern urticating moth, Euproctis flava Bremer, was made at the suburb of Nagoya-city. As the insecticide to be applied 3% γ-BHC dust was tested preliminarily in the laboratory. The BHC dusting by a helicopter Bell-47-G was applied over the habitat of the caterpillars by a ratio of 3kg of the dust to 10 are of the control area. In order to know the quantity of deposit and the spread of applied insecticide dust, and its correlation to toxic effect to pest, some experiments were carried out. For mesuring the deposit of insecticide dust the method of Hatai and Kimura (1954) using a scale has been introduced into this test. The toxic effect of the deposit to pest was evaluated using the caterpillars and adult of laboratry-reared house flies which were confined in a cage and placed at the aerial application field, along with a model test in laboratry. Through these experiments, it was confirmed that a practical value of the deposit and the spread of insecticide dust are obtainable by the condition of application and flight such as, flight-speed, flight-height, application-doses, etc., as shown in table 5. Such deposit was also proved to be effective against the test insects.

N2  - Octachlorodipropylether (S 421), a synergist for pyrethrins, was examined as a synergist for chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphorus compounds against the larvae of the housefly and of Culex pipiens pallens. When the ratio of octachlorodipropylether to chlorinated hydrocarbon was 0.2 to 1 or 1 to 1, it showed a marked synergistic action with DDT, γ-BHC and dieldrin against the resistant mosquito larvae. It also activated γ-BHC against both resistant and susceptible housefly larvae. A similar but smaller synergistic effect was found for organophosphorus compounds when it applied against the resistant populations.

N2  - The field tests to estimate the residual effect of diazinon emulsion on larvae of the common house mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, were carried out in ditches in Kawasaki City in the period from Sept. 1 to Sept. 25, 1960. Half ppm to the volume of water of diazinon was sprayed in ditches and the effect on mosquito larvae was estimated daily till 6 to 10 days after the application. The results were summarized as follows : After the application, mosquito eggs decreased in minimum numbers after 2 to 3 days, reincreased gradually, and after 6 days recovered nearly to the level before the application. In most cases, number of larvae decreased in minimum 1 day after the application and that of pupae after 2 days. Average period from the application to the reappearance of 1st and 2nd instar larvae was 4.2 days, that of 3rd and 4th instar larvae was 7.1 days and that of pupae was 8.6 days. Therefore the authors were led to the conclusion that the real residual effect of diazinon was almost none or 2 or 3 days at most and that the application of once a week was necessary for the practical control of the larvae.

N2  - The three species of rats, the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), the roof rat (R. rattus) and the Japan house mouse (Mus musculus), are the most common species in houses in Japan. But, in the cities, R. nor. and R. r. are the dominant species and Mus. m. has been rarely found in the building. Recently, an apartment house group was found in the suburbs of Tokyo, in which Mus. sp. was the dominant species in-and out-doors and the ecological studies on the mice were made in this apartment. Collection of mice and rats using snap and alive-traps for three days was made in some buildings and in the field of the site. Six mice (3 females, 3 males) were captured in some households and a female Norway rat was also found in the field. According to the questioning and observations on the mouse injuries, mice were widely distributed over the apartment. Usually, their entrances into the building were small, 10 to 20mm in width, and some improvements may be necessary to prevent their invasion.

N2  - Dispersal tests were carried out in suburban areas of Kyoto from Feb.3 to Mar.16, 1959. The materials were collected by trapping at the three dumping places, and were composed of three species of adult flies. Musca vicina, Aldrichina grahami, and Muscina stabulans. They were marked with aniline dyes and were released from the trapping sites in the very day. 32〜35 traps were distributed on four concentric circles at the distances of 50, 100, 200, 400m, from the release point respectively, for the purpose of the recapture. The recapture operations were conducted during 3〜4 days. The temperature measured at the release points at 10 a.m. ranged from 2.3 to 13.0℃. The results obtained were summarized as follows : Musca vicina, Aldrichina grahami and Muscina stabulans were recovered in the trap placed up to the maximum distance, 400m. Percentage of total recaptures in A. grahami and in M. vicina were 3.2% and 0.9% respectively. Percentage of the recaptures of A. grahami were exclusively higher than that of M. vicina on each circle. The rate of marked individuals of the whole flies showed comparatively higher at the traps located on the circle of the distance less than 100m, for both species. It would seem that A. grahmi leaves away from the release point more rapidly than M. vicina. From the results thus obtained, it was shown that M. vicina is likely to assemble in residential districts than in open areas, while A. grahami to congregate in open areas.

N2  - 1) From June to November, 1951, mosquitoes were collected by a sucking tube at a goat-house in the suburbs of Utsunomiya City. 2) 2, 413 mosquitoes referable to 3 genera, 8 species, were collected. Of these C. tritaeniorhynchus (27.6%) was dominant in number, and A. sinensis (21.4%), Ar. subalbatus (20.0%), Ae. vexans nipponii (17.2%), C. pipiens (12.6%), etc., followed it. It is remarkable that the rate of the collection of C. tritaeniorhynchus is comparatively small and Ar. subalbatus is collected extremely large in number. 3) The majority of mosquitoes collected are the female, and the male occupied only 0.2% of the total number of mosquitoes. 4) C. tritaeniorhynchus shows the maximum in the middle of August and disappears in the middle of September. 5) A. sinensis reaches the highest peak from the end of July to the biginning of August and afterward the second peak. This species disappears in the middle of October. 6) Ar. subalbatus appears considerably large in number in the middle of June. This species shows a peak respectively at the end of June, August and September, the last peak being the highest, and disappears in November. 7) Ar. vexans nipponii has showed the muximum in the middle of July. This species appears in small number continuously and disappears in the middle of October. 8) C. pipiens shows the maximum at the end of July and disappears in November. 9) C. bitaeniorhynchus is collected in small numbers continuously from the end of June to the end of September and appears comparatively large in number during the later part of October. 10) As a whole, the muximum activity of all the mosquitoes is attained from the end of June to the end of August. But there are some differences among the periods of maximum activities of various mosquito species.

N2  - From June to October, 1959, fly-surveys were made in three places of Ibaraki Prefecture, Dejima, Tsuchiura and Daigo with regard to the fly-fauna bred from the livestock bed of cattle barns and pig pens. Flies taken from pens and the same from houses were also compared. The flies emerged out from three cattle barns and two pig pens were classified into 7 families, 13 genera and 17 species. The majority of them were the species of public health importance. The dominant family was the Muscidae. Stomoxys calcitrans was the most dominant in number and Musca vicina was the next. It was observed that in autumn there was a noticeable rise in number of M. vicina and S. calcitrans emerging out from the livestock bed. S. calcitrans was the major constituent (75%) of fly-fauna in animal pens, whereas most of flies taken by traps set in houses were M. vicina.

The LD_<50> value to diazinon topically applied to female RP flies was about 10 times that of the CSMA and Takatsuki, respectively. The ratio of the LD_<50> of RP flies to that of regular flies was 4.4-19.8 for γ-BHC, 24.8-34.4 for dieldrin, and 3.2-65.4 for technical DDT. Tests using the third instar larvae of the RP strain indicated the larval LC_<50> level to be 13 times the normal larvae for diazinon.

N2  - 1. In July 25, 1955, one of the authors, caught two adult scorpions at the mouth of the Myohoji River, Suma Seacoast, Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture. 2. The scorpions inhabited on dampish sand under a rock at the seashore. 3. This specimen almost agrees in the general taxonomic characters with Buthus martensii Karsch. 4. The specimen is female by the morphology of the pedipalps genital palates, and its body length (6.5mm) shows that it is an adult. 5. Abnormalities are found in that the comblike organs and lateral eyes, both important in taxonomical characters, are 27 and 3 in numbers, respectively. 6. This is the first record from Japan, as the species has hitherto not been found there. 7. Judged from the geographical circumstances of its habitat, it seems probable that they were carried from the original locality by marine baggage, to which they attached, landed by chance, and survived.

N2  - Five species of fleas of the genus Peromyscopsylla I. Fox (family Leptopsyllidae) have been reported in Japan by several authors. P. hamifer takahasii is the only form which is distributed in Hokkaido. P. udagawai, ino and segregata which belong to hamifer group of Johnson and Traub (1954), and are alike one another, inhabit the different parts of the central Honshu. P. himalaica occurs on the Izu islands and Kochi-ken, Shikoku. In the present paper, the author has corrected some confusions caused by the mis-identities of the previous papers and describes a new subspecies of hamifer collected from the vole, Clethrionomys andersoni taken in Aomori-ken, northern part of Honshu.

N2  - Results of the laboratory rearings of Japanese trombiculid mites made by the author since 1950 are summarized, and the details of improved technics now adopted in her laboratory are presented. Most of the materials have been collected in nature as engorged larvae from various hosts, and are kept in plastic vials with solidified gypsum-charcoal mixture as the substratum under adequate temperature and humidity. After the resting stage of about two weeks, they moult into nymphs. Eggs of various insects were given as their food, such as of Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, dragonflies, and Collembola. Nymphs develop into adults after resting stage of about two weeks. Oviposition by the females was seen in three species (Trombicula akamushi, Trombicula pallida and Trombicula intermedia) and production of spermatophore by males was observed in Trombicula akamushi. It usually takes three months to complete their life cycle in the laboratory. Improvements in the rearing technics have been introduced in several aspects. Plastic containers were found to yield better results than glass vials. A filter paper sheet was inserted between the two pieces of plastic containers to prevent larvae from drawing into water droplets and from escaping. The use of a cone made of gypsum-charcoal mixture gave excellent results in keeping unengorged larvae alive for several months, as they stood still forming a cluster on its surface. Microtus montebelli, a field vole common in Japan, was found to be the best experimental host for T. akamushi and related species, and almost all of the unengorged larvae artificially attached to it were recovered as fully engorged.

N2  - As the results of laboratory rearings of Japanese trombiculids since 1950, the author could rear 6 genera and 29 species to nymphs and 12 species to adults. The rearings for this purpose were mostly made by keeping engorged larvae individually in small containers, and identification of species was made by examining the larval skin cast. A key to identify these nymphs is presented. Microphotographs of the main species to show their important structures are also presented.

N2  - With a view to study experimentally the influence of duck-raising to the occurrence of mosquito larvae, I raised forty ducks, at the ratio of a duck per 1.9 square meters, in a pond of the suburbs of Makassar, Celebes. I investigated mosquito larvae and environmental factors in the same pond for a month. In the consequence of raising ducks, I ascertained that water became muddy and aquatic algae declined in its luxuriance and then Anopheles larvae decreased remarkably in number. Also Culex larvae showed the tendency to decrease in number.

N2  - Using the fly catch ribbon, the seasonal change of the fly fauna in a dwelling house was observed, during a period from April 1957 to March 1959 in Kawasaki City, near Tokyo. From a living room 2, 934 adult flies in total which are referable to 20 species, and from a lavatory 1, 081 individuals referable 14 species were collected; the majority of them was consist of Fannia canicularis (65.9%) and Musca domestica vicina (31.4%). Both species are recognizable throughout the year and are most abundant during the months from April to December. The prevalence had two peaks a year. In M. d. vicina, the first peak was lower than the second, while in F. canicularis the first peak was higher than the second. It seemed that both the species do not abundantly occur simultaniously in a same season. A considerable difference was observed between the peak of occurrence in 1957 and 1958.

N2  - In this paper was given the results of one year's observation on species and seasonal prevalence of flies collected by means of the glass trap in Mito City, Ibaraki Prefecture, from February, 1958 to January, 1959. As shown in Table 1, the total flies collected were classified into 5 families, 9 genera and 14 species. In general houses, the flies collected were 343 individuals, belonging to 5 families, 9 genera and 9 species. Fannia canicularis and Musca vicina occupy about 90% in number, representing the great majority of the individuals. In a fishmonger, the flies collected were 905 individuals which belong to 4 families, 8 genera and 13 species. The family Calliphoridae occupies about 82% in number. The peaks of the population curves of flies at those three stations were found in July.

N2  - The author has previously made descriptions of Japanese anopheline pupae. At that time several abnormalities were encountered in those specimens. Few case of pupal abnormality has been reported, and the author will hereby make brief descriptions about these examples. Number of specimens observed is given in Table 1. All pupal materials except for A. lindesaii japonicus were obtained by the rearing of larvae hatched from the eggs under the room temperature (about 20-28℃). The larvae of A. lindesaii japonicus were collected in mountain streams and were also reared to the adults in the same condition. The pupal pelts left alone in the water by emergence of the adults were preserved in a 10% formalin solution until the materials were gathered enough to be examined. Then the pelts were mounted in a gum-chloral solution and were observed under the binocular microscope.

N2  - In Japan moles of the genus Mogera are generally rather lightly infested with fleas and many of these big moles are completely free of fleas. From Mogera wogura we have a small series of fleas from Mt. Fuji (Yamanashi-ken) and Kibune (Kyoto-fu) which are a species of Palaeopsylla very close to P. nippon Jameson and Kumada, 1953. One pair from Mogera wogura from Korea are also of this species.

The species of hosts were Urotrichus talpoides (2 individuals), Apodemus speciosus (10), Rattus rattus (1), R. norvegicus (1), Petaurista leucogenys (2), and Nycterutes procyonoides (3) respectively and fleas collected from them were 8 genera, 8 species and 281 individuals. Palaeopsylla nippon was collected from U. talpoides, a few Nosopsyllus fasciatus from both R. rattus and R. norvegicus, and Chaetopsylla mikado from P. leucogenys. The records that Neopsylla specialis was found on P. leucogenys and Htyphloceras shogakii was collected from both P. leucogenys and N. procyonoides were new. And record of Rhadinopsylla japonica from Kyusyu was also new. Paraceras melis flabellum, the peculiar parasite of N. procyonoides was collected from its own host and the fact that Monopsyllus argus was found on P. leucogenys will be proved by the reason of N. procyonoides is one of the food of P. leucogenys. The number of specimens collected other than P. leucogenys would become few, because of the most of those hosts have been treated not soon after death.

N2  - Effect of octachlorodiprophylether (S 421), a synergist for pyrethrins and allethrin, was studied in an attempt to utilize as a synergist against resistant and susceptible colonies of the house fly, Musca domestica vicina and M. d. domestica. The result shows that the S 421 will be able to consider as a suitable synergist for pyrethrins and allethrin. In case of allethrin S 421 showed a definite superiority over piperonyl butoxide as has been known using European house flies. The p, p′-DDT or technical DDT plus octachlorodipropylether (S 421) showed a remarkable synergistic activity against the Japanese vicina, indicated the original high tolerance to DDT, as compared with the activity of p, p′-DDT or technical DDT alone. The optimum ratio of the content of S 421 to the content of DDT was 0.2 to 1. Similarly, the efficacy of γ-BHC or dieldrin added with S 421 at a ratio of 1 : 1-10 proved to be far higher than that of γ-BHC or dieldrin alone against the resistant populations, whereas it imparted a slight increase in efficacy against the susceptible populations.

N2  - A series of experiment was made to determine the most efficient method to control the house fly with the insecticide-treated tapes. 1. Kinds of insecticide applied on the tape. Among the chemicals tested, 5% diazinon was found to give the most satisfactory results in both the initial and residual effects. DDVP was inferior in its residual effect though the initial effect was excellent. Malathion showed a long residual effect but the kill percentage was lower throughout the test period. Dieldrin, DDT and lindane gave no promising results to be applied in the tape method. 2. Installation of the tapes. The optimum size of the tapes to be installed in a room was found to be 2 to 3cm in width and 6 to 100cm in length as estimated from the number of flies alighted. In case that tapes were installed vertically from the ceiling, the average fly count was higher on wider tapes, but the count per unit of area become higher as the tapes were made narrow. When they were installed horizontally near the ceiling, the highest fly count was seen at the width of 2cm. The resting time of house fly on the narrower tape was longer than on the wider one. 3. Materials of choice of the tapes. When the same amount of diazinon was applied to various substrates, the initial effect against the house fly was by the order of indian paper, filter paper and cotton cloth, the residual effect, however, it was found to be the reverse, as parallel to the rate of absorption of the materials. The fact suggests that the insecticide was first absorbed into the substrates, and then gradually dispersed to the surface again. The view was also supported by the experiment that among various insecticides applied on a sheet of filter paper, diazinon, DDVP, lindane and dieldrin were found to disperse through another filter papers put in contact with the treated surface by the elapse of time, until the untreated surface became insecticidal to the flies exposed on it.

N2  - Among the cases of scrub typhus newly recognized in Japan after the World War II, those prevalent in the Izu Shichito Islands of Tokyo Prefecture, in Awa-gun, Chiba Prefecture, and in Mt. Fuji area, Shizuoka Prefecture, are called as the "Shichito type scrub typhus" or as the "scutellaris type scrub typhus, " and Trombicula scutellaris has been presumably incriminated as a potential vector of this type of scrub typhus. The study on scrub typhus in Chiba Prefecture was commenced in 1952, when the so called "twentydays fever, " an endemic disease in this Prefecture, was assumed to belong to a scrub typhus by Kasahara et al. (1952) and Kitaoka et al. (1952).

N2  - The observations of the behavior of the house fly Musca domestica vicina and the lesser house fly Musca domestica vicina and the lesser house fly Fannia canicularis, inhabiting most commonly in houses in Japan, were carried out at inside and outside of a residence in Kawasaki city in winter season of 1958. Their activities showed the diurnal rhythm depending upon the environments surround them, and were found to be correlated mainly with the changes in the air temperature and the light intensity. The flies resting on the ceiling during the night, owing to the low temperature and the low light intensity, began to leave from the resting sites at 11.0〜12.0℃ (M. d. vicina) and 8.4〜10.5℃ at 12〜100lux (F. canicularis) in the morning. And they began to come back to the ceiling again below 9.8℃ or 200lux (M. d. vicina) and 9.8〜11.2℃ or 75lux (F. canicularis). The beginning of the rotary flying of F. canicularis was found at 10.8〜12.4℃ or 12〜800lux. M. d. vicina inhahiting indoors in the morning. in the evening and at night went out often to the sunny place of outdoor in the daytime, while F. canicularis stayed at indoors through a whole day. Their resting sites at night were almost ceiling of room, in which being active in the daytime.

N2  - The bionomics of American cookroach, Periplaneta americana, was investigated in the apartments in Hashima Island, Kyushu, Japan, and the experiments on the control of the roaches by the application of four kinds of insecticides were also done in the same apartments. The results were summarized as follows : In Hashima Island, P. americana was the dominant species of the roaches, the bionomics of which had scarcely been reported in Japan except a few records on the local distribution, and the other species found were P. fuliginosa and Blattella germanica, both of which were far less than P. americana. Male roaches were more abundantly found than the female ones. The roaches were found to be distributed in the apartments not evenly but concentratedly to the particular sections, where kitchinranges would often be used and firewoods and the other materials were disorderly kept under the kitchinranges, or highly moisty. The spray of insecticidal emulsion directly to/or near the hiding places of the roaches were more effective than the coating of the emulsion on the corners or the edges where the roaches would often crawl. The most effective methods were the spray of 1% lindane emulsion and the mixed emulsion of 0.4% dieldrin and 0.6% lindane. The spray of 1% diazinon emulsion was comparatively effective and the effect of 1% BHC suspension was lower than the chemicals stated above. However, about 30 days after the application of any insecticides adopted there, the population of the roaches was found to recover to the level before the application. By the application of the insecticides, the ratio of larvae to all the roaches and that of the male to all adult roaches decreased, probably because of higher susceptibility of larvae than adults and of the male than the female. Thus, it caused the increase of the ratio of female roaches to all the roaches. The fog application of 9.2cc of 0.3% DDVP solution per square meter of floor were practically ineffective to American cockroaches.

N2  - Field tests of the control of adult flies, their larvae and mosquito larvae by malathion were done during 1 June to 28 July, 1955, in Yokaichiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. The results were summarized as follows : By the spray of 27 to 42cc of 0.5% emulsion or 0.7% kerosene solution of malathion per square meter on the ceilings of the dwellings, the fly population estimated by traps set in dwellings decreased remarkably and the effect lasted for 7 to 10 days. To fly larvae in latrines, the application of 2 liters of 0.1% emulsion or 100g of 1.5% dust of malathion was effective, but the larvae emerged again 7 days after the application. The fly larvae in manure heaps could be controlled by spraying 10 liters of 0.02% malathion emulsion per square meter, though the spray of 2 liters of 0.1% emulsion was almost ineffective. The difference in the effect of applying the same amount of the active ingredient may be ascribed to the permeability of the chemical into the heaps. The application of 100cc of 0.2% malathion emulsion per square meter was effective to mosquito larvae in water tanks or small ponds, though almost ineffective to the pupae of the mosquito.

N2  - Attempts were made to clarify some problems of cockroach control in large buildings by means of dry fog-blowing of insecticide. Laboratry-reared adult insects of Blattella germanica Linne and Periplaneta fuliginosa Serville have been introduced into some test-sites. DDVP was only used as test-insecticides. (1) Repeated application tests in which the test insects were confined in a glass ring and placed in each test room showed that the standard amount of the DDVP required for the practical control should be as below : for B. germanica 100ml, per 99cu. meter in a 0.3per cent of oil solution; for P. fuliginosa 200ml., per 99cu. meter in a 0.3per cent of oil solution. (2) It was experimentally confirmed using artificially introduced test-insects that the effect of fogs against the cockroaches inhabiting closed hiding places is difficult to expect, and therefore one should take into consideration that the applied fogs can penetrate into the hiding places by beforehand arrangement. (3) It was also confirmed that the residue after two days showed no effect against German roach. (4) Natural poulation of the cockroaches inhabiting each room of a business building was estimated and the population density and its correlation to the business activity was discussed.

N2  - The authors' intension in the present experiments was to compare the effect of the residues of dieldrin, chlordane, lindane and diazinon to German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., brought into contact for 10 minutes successively, i. e. for 2 minutes once a day in 5 days. The results obtained were summarized that dieldrin and chlordane were equally or slightly more effective in the intermittent contact method than in successive contact method, and, on the contrary, lindane and diazinon were more effective in successive contact method. Based upon the results obtained in the present and previous papers, the authors were led to the conclusion that dieldrin was the most effective and adequate chemical in practical control of German cockroaches by painting the insecticides narrowly on the surface on which the roaches would often crawl.

N2  - In order to ascertain the behavioristic reaction of housefly to certain residues of chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, the laboratory tests were made with six strains of housefly, Musca vicina Macq., which had been reared for several months to four years in laboratory. The strains collected from various parts of this country were as follows : DKM (Tokyo), DKE (Ebina, Kanagawa Pref.), DKA (Nase City; Kagoshima Pref.), Aminoko (Aminoko, Amami Islands, Kagoshima Pref.), Kamiaso (Kamiaso, Kanagawa Pref.), and Misaki (Misaki, Kanagawa Pref.). Filter paper containing a given amount of test insecticide (2.5g/m^2 of DDT or 0.25g/m^2 of lindane) was placed in the bottom of the test cage which consisted of net-screen, 15cm in diameter and 5cm in height. Thirty flies were used in each experiment. The flies were allowed to behave freely. During the exposure of five hours, number of flies on the paper and their knocked down rate was counted at 20-minutes intervals. As shown in the results, there were some differences in susceptibility of insecticide among the strains and this phenomenon might due to the differences in physiological resistance among each strain. However, the evidence of a combined physiological and behavioristic resistance in a certain strain was also observed in the present tests. The results have shown that flies of DKM-strain avoided insecticide residues on paper, consequently, lower mortality and higher KT-50 value were obtained. When the flies of this strain were treated topically, they were comparatively susceptible to DDT and lindane.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were carried out to compare the effectiveness of diazinon, malathion, lindane, dieldrin and DDT against tropical rat mite, Liponyssus bacoti (Hirst), by the method of spray or contact. The results were summarized as follows : diazinon was the most effective of all the chemicals tested. Malathion came next rank. Lindane was slightly less effective than malathion. Dieldrin and DDT were ineffective to the mite. Considering both on mammalian toxicity and effectiveness to the mite, malathion seemed to be the most suitable chemical for practical control of tropical rat mites.

In the present paper, the authors report the constitution of the insects and their daily fluctuation in numbers, attracted to a light trap situated at the bank of the River Seta, Siga Prefecture, in July 5-6, 1958. In this station, many caddisflies, mayflies and dipterous insects were caught. Their daily fluctuation were shown in Fig 1. Caddisflies were most abundant from sunset to 9 p.m.. Mayflies showed the peak between 9 to 10 p.m. Dipterous insects (chiefly a species of sand-fly) were showed the peak 11 to 12 p.m. The flying activity of these insects seemed to begin from the sunset and to end before the midnight.

N2  - Up to date about 20 species of oribatid mites were recorded from Japan. In addition to them the author newly recorded of 13 species from our country. They are Camisia segnis HERM., C. lapponica TRAGDH., Heminothrus targioni (BERL.), Hypochthonis rufulus C. L. KOCH, Hypochthoniella pallidula (C. L. KOCH), Trhypochthonius tectorum (BERL.), Nanhermannia nana (NIC.), Xenillus tegeocranus (HERM.), Cepheus cepheiformis (NIC.), C. latus (C. L. KOCH), Oppia quadricarinata (MICH.) and Protoribates monodactylus (HALLER). For our convenience the author proposed the Japanese common names for each family of oribatid mites. The Japanese morphological terms were also standardised with a schema.

N2  - Material : One of the two engorged specimens obtained from Microtus montebelli caught alive in Aizu-bange cho, Fukushima Pref., on 10 April, 1959, was chosen as a holotype. The other larva was reared at the room temperature, and the moulted nymph was mounted on a slide on 21 May, about 24 hours after its emergence, associated with its larval skin. Description : Large species for the genus, being the idiosoma attained about 900μlong by about 700μwide in the engorged specimens. Color in life white. Gnathosoma : Palpal femoral, genual, and lateral tibial setae nude; dorsal tibial seta feathered; ventral tibial seta well developed and strongly feathered. Palpal claw three-pronged. Galeal seta feathered. Cheliceral blade with usual tricuspid cap. Scutum : More or less trapezoid in shape, about 1.5 times as wide as long, with weakly curved posterior margin and angular posterolateral corners. Sensillae nude basally, plumose distally, and situated a little behind the level of posterolateral setae. Anterolateral setae with long and slender branches in contrast to the posterolateral setae which bear short and stout barbs. Scutal measurements are shown in Table 1. Eyes and body setae : Two eyes on each side of scutum, the anterior larger than the posterior. Dorsal setae 30, arranged in regular rows, 2-8-6-6-4-2-2, and similar in form to the posterolateral setae on scutum. Sternal setae 2-2; other ventral setae about 40 in number. Legs : All legs with seven segments. Coxal seta 1-1-1; seta on coxa III near anterior margin of coxa. Nude setae on legs quite similar in form and arrangement to those of Trombicula (Leptotrombidium) palpalis as follows : Leg I; 2 genualae, 1 microgenuala, 2 tibialae, 1 microtibiala, 4 tarsalae (1 median rod-shaped tarsala and 1 subterminal, 1 parasubterminal and 1 pretarsal tarsalae) and 1 microtarsala. Leg II; 1 genuala, 2 tibialae, 2 tarsalae (1 median rod-shaped tarsala and 1 pretarsal tarsala) and 1 microtarsala. Leg III; 1 genuala and 1 tibiala. Remarks : Trombicula (Leptotrombidium) kitaokai n. sp. is closely related to T. (L.) yasuokai. The species, however, is distinguished from the latter by the general shape of scutum with AP greater than PS, and strongly developed ventral tibial seta on palp. The species is further separated from T. (L.) yasuokai by the dorsal setal number, in the former that is 2-8-6-6-4-2-2, fewer than in the latter. The species is named for Dr. Masami Kitaoka, head of the Department of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Institute of Health, who has made notable contributions to knowledge of scrub typhus or tsutsugamushi disease in Japan.

N2  - The systematic description on the horsefly larvae was made in this paper as follows. The sixty-nine adults emerged from about one hundred larvae which were mostly collected from the mud of the paddy-fields and were reared separately in the laboratory. According to the characteristic of the adults, it was proved that the larvae consisted of at least ten species. In this way the hitherto unknown larvae belonging four species (Tabanus takasagoensis SHIRAKI, T. trigonus COQUILLETT, T. sp. 1 and Gn. sp. 2) were described and figured, and one species (T. mandarinus SCHINER) was emended. The key to the larvae of ten species (six recorded and four above mentioned) was also given in this paper.

N2  - The Mallophagan genera Dennyus and Eureum, which infest only swifts or Apodi, are found on the large white-rumped swift, Apus pacificus pacificus (LATHAM) from Japan. The genus Dennyus from the Japanese swifts has been previously known by two species, Dennyus truncatus UCHIDA, 1926 (nec OLFERS, 1816) and Takamatsuia major UCHIDA, 1926 and recently I redescribe and figure the latter as a subgenus of Dennyus (see NAKAGAWA, 1959). The genus Eureum, which is extremely rare in collecting, is still an unknown genus from Japan. My best thanks are due to Drs. K. ASANUMA, S. UCHIDA and Prof. H. SAWADA for their guidance and encouragement. I am equally thankful to Mr. M. HASEGAWA and Dr. Th. CLAY for their generous help during the preparation of this paper. The material examined have been collected through the co-operation of Messrs. T. TAKADA and T. KAWAI. The specimen is in the author's collection.

The samples were collected from the pharmacies in 69 national hospitals at Kanto District, and examined during the period from October 1958 to January 1959. Of 1071 specimens 44 (4.1%) were found to harbor the mites and 51 (4.8%) contaminated with the insects. The main species of the mites isolated from those stocked drugs were Tyrophagus dimidiatus, Hyohondania kanoi and Glyciphagus destructor.

N2  - 1. The experiments on the parasitization of a parsite wasp, Mormoniella vitripennis to housefly pupae were performed, and the results in two kinds of environment were compared. 2. Two kinds of media for fly larvae viz. medium A and B (Refer to Figure 1 and 2) were prepared. A grass pot (16cm in diameter) was separated into four sections, two of them of diagonal position were filled with medium A and the other two were filled with medium B. 3. Housefly larvae were reared in these pots, and the fly pupae in each section were counted. In this combination of media, fly pupae were found more abundant in medium A than in medium B. The result seems to show that the medium A was more attractive and suitable for fly larvae. 4. The experiments on the parasitization of Mormoniella vitripennis to fly pupae reared in such combination of media were made and the percentages of parasitization in each medium were observed. As the results of the experiments, high percentages of parasitization were observed in medium A. By these attacks of the parasite wasp, the number of emerged flies were highly reduced in medium A, but those from medium B was not so much reduced than in medium A. 5. Whereas the difference of the percentages of parasitization is taken place in these two media, it is concluded that the abundance of emerged houseflies depends not only to the suitability for the growth of the larvae but also to other environmental factors such as the existence of parasite wasp etc.

N2  - In the present paper, the constructive materials. and fauna found in nests of rats were discussed. Seven nests were collected in Izumi-Ohtsu City. Osaka. The constructive materials of the nests in the rural district were simply made of straw alone, while the materials of nests in the urban district were miscellaneous, such as paper, rags or bark. Fauna in the nests of rats consisted of 2 classes-Insecta (14 species) and Arachnoidea (10 species)-and 1273 individuals. Individual number of insects was more than that of Arachnoidea, but most of constitutional member in the nest were Nosopsyllus fasciatus and Liponyssus bacoti, the blood suckers of the host. Nosopsyllus fasciatus was found often very numerously in a nest. Female occupies the majority of whole number but the male is superior in living member, many of former being found died.

N2  - In order to obtain the fundamental data for the mosquito control operation, a survey of mosquito fauna were carried out using the light traps throughout a whole year from April, 1958 at the three stations of Kawasaki City. 1. The mosquitoes collected were 12 species in 4.154 individuals. Culex pipiens pallens (76.9%), C. tritaeniorhynchus (12.1%), Aedes vexans (7.1%) and Anopheles hyrcanus sinensis (1.1%) occupied the great majority of the specimens collected. 2. C. pipiens pallens were collected throughout the year except January, and scatteringly during February and March. The emergence of the first generation occurred early in May and became the maximum number in the early part of July. 3. Of C. tritaeniorhynchus, the emergence of first generation and the maximum number were observed in the end of June and the early part of July, respectively. 4. Both the female and male adults of Aedes vexans were collected together at first in the middle of June. The two peaks of the population curve were observed, one in the end of June and other in the end of July, respectively. 5. Based upon the results thus obtained, the procedure of control program should be arranged as follows; from June to September, a great attention should be paid to the breeding sites of C. pipiens pallens, and against C. tritaeniorhynchus and A. vexans, the control measures should be applied to paddy field and ground pool during June.

N2  - To decide the standard amount of three insecticides in the control programs of the larvae of mosquito, Culex pipiens pallens, in ditches in Kawasaki City, field tests were conducted using lindane, dieldrin and diazinon on August 12 to September 12, 1958. After the experiments, diazinon was the most effective in the three insecticides tested. The application of 150cc of 0.025% diazinon emulsion or 800cc of 0.1% lindane emulsion per m^2 was practically effective to the larvae, but even that of 800cc of 0.05% dieldrin emulsion per m^2 was not so effective. Comparing the data presented here with those reported by the other workers, lindane and dieldrin seemed to be far less effective to the larvae found in test ditches in Kawasaki. Then the susceptibility of the larvae collected in Kawasaki was compared with that in Tokyo, which located across the Tama River. Consequently, the authors were led to the conclusion that the larvae collected in Kawasaki were highly resistant to p, p'-DDT, lindane and dieldrin. This due to the frequent application of DDT and lindane for larval control since 1948. The resistance to dieldrin may be attributed to the cross resistance to lindane or DDT, perhaps to the former.

N2  - Some basic studies were made on the methods of control mosquitoes, which are the vectors of filariasis, in the south-western areas of Japan. The problem that arose during the work and the results obtained are summarized. 1. The larvae of the four species of mosquitoes were used in the screening test of various insecticide emulsions. The species were : Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett, Aedes aegypti Linne, Aedes albopictus Skuse, Armigeres subalbatus Coquillett. Parathion was the most effective insecticide followed by dieldrin and various other organic phosphates were less effective than these two chemicals. The residual effect of each insecticide was tested on the mosquito larvae by using each insecticide in solution at its LC_<50> concentration : The chlorinated insecticides as p-p'-DDT, lindane and dieldrin were all as effective at two days after the application as at the time of application, whereas the organic phosphorus insecticides, diazinon and malathion had lost entierly their effectiveness two days later. 2. It was observed that Culex pipiens pallens rested on the dark vertical room surfaces such as walls, door and windows. Also, many dead mosquitoes were observed in the adjacent unsprayed room, to that sprayed with dieldrin. 3. The susceptibility between adults and larvae differed greatly when the insecticide was applied to the adult's dorsal thorax by topical application and to the larvae by dipping in water suspension. By the Busvine-Nash contact method 2 hours exposure to inpregnated filter papers with counting 24 hours later gave the most reliable results. 4. The residual spraying experiments were carried out in three villages, Matsu, Myozin and Futanazu, each about 3 kilometer distance from the other. 0.25% dieldrin emulsion was applied to two of the villages leaving Myozin as untreated check. 4 months after the application the susceptibility of houseflies to p-p'-DDT, lindane and dieldrin was measured by topical application. The houseflies were collected from the two sprayed villages and it was noted that their vigour was somewhat greater than those houseflies collected from the unsprayed villages. It is not clear whether this is due, in this early stage of the experiment, to insect resistance or to other factor. 5. In the Amami island experiments of a residual spraying of dieldrin on 30th June was made in Ariya, Nakakachi and Aminoko villages. Mosquitoes were almost completely eradicated for the duration of the summer. 6. In Ehime prefecture a residual dieldrin spray was applied in Futanazu and Matsu villages. The mosquitoes were successfully eradicated for the whole of the summer season. On the other hand, houseflies were controlled for about one month and then the population showed abnormal increase. 7. The similar phenomena were observed in all four villages sprayed in Amami island with DDT or dieldrin. A second spraying with the DDT or dieldrin emulsion was made in the same these villages. Dieldrin gave no control to the housefly whereas DDT controled them for about one week only. The reason for a lack of control of houseflies was not clear as housefly resistance to dieldrin was not proved. It is necessary to study further application of different insecticides used alternatively.

N2  - 1. The field tests of oil solution, emulsion and dust of malathon (malathion) were carried out at a rural district in Osaka Prefecture. 2. The fly-ribbon and the fly-grill were employed for the decision of the efficiency of the insecticide. The distinct decrease of house fly population were shown at the kitchen, the room of the live stock compared with the control district. 3. The residual efficiency of dusting at the dump was more continuous among all others. 4. The control efficiency on larvae in the toilet pool are as follows, the efficiency were shown with the emulsion (up to 0.025%) or dusting (ar-round 25 grams per 1 m^2), but for expecting more than 7 days' efficiency, it was necessary more than 100 grams per 1 m^2 of dusting. In the cess pool, the larvae do not growing up by once dusting without following throw of faeces.

N2  - The insecticidal activity of the residues applied by different systems were compared by using house fly, Musca vicina Maquart. Totally equal amount of the insecticides, mainly diazinon, were applied on different size of the surface of filter papers. The insecticidal activity of the residues was estimated by comparing the median knockdown time of the flies brought into contact with the filter paper. The results obtained through the present tests. are summarized as follows : The treatments of the entire surface with lowest dosage per unit of area were more effective than those of partial surface with more or less higher dosage per area in the initial tests. However, as the days elapsed, the former was found to lose its residual effect faster than the latter group, and those treated on smaller surface under thicker application began to show better knockdown effects. Briefly speaking, residual effects may be expected when a surface is treated partially in thicker concentrations per unit of area than that sprayed on larger surface under lower concentrations, if the same total amount of an insecticide was used. The fact also gives an explanation for the remarkably long lasting residual effects of the strips impregnated with diazinon.

N2  - The effects of five insecticides to German cockroach, Blattella germanica L., were compared by exposing the insects to the residues of insecticides of different dosage in different period of exposure. Each half c. c. of dilution of lindane, dieldrin, chlordane, diazinon and DDVP was applied to a venner plate of 10cm×10cm. After drying the plates for 1 day, roaches were exposed to them for limited time, then, they transferred into clear pots. The knockdown percentage was counted during 6 days after the application. The results were as follows : 1) The KD-50s from each chemical plotted on a paper of log dosage (Y axis) and log time (X axis) nearly formed a straight line except the case of lindane and dieldrin in female roaches which formed two crossed lines. In the former, the line from the contact in shorter time was steeper, and in the latter, that in longer time was steeper. 2) Comparing in the KD-50s after six days, dieldrin was the most effective to both sexes. The effectiveness to the male decreased in the following order ; lindane, chlordane, diazinon, DDVP. To the female, the effects of lindane, chlordane and diazinon were nearly equal. 3) After the tests noted here, male roaches were always more susceptible than female ones. The ratio of the susceptibility of male to female was the smallest in diazinon and the ratio increased in the following order ; dieldrin, chlordane, lindane respectively. 4) In practical control program of German cockroach by painting the insecticides narrowly on the surface on which roaches would often crawl, dieldrin seemed to be the most effective, and lindane, chlordane and diazinon were also effective, but DDVP seemed unsuitable in this application method.
