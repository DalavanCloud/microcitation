N2  - In Tokyo Bay, Mediterranean green crabs (Carcinus aestuarii) have successfully invaded and now coexist with several species of native shore crabs. We examined aspects of feeding behavior for C.aestuarii and one common native shore crab, Hemigrapsus takanoi, to improve our understanding of potential ecological interactions and impacts. Consumption rates, shell breaking ability and size selectivity were quantified using the black-pigmy mussel Xenostrobus securis as an example of typical decapod prey. The experiments revealed that (1) both species consumed similar amounts of the mussels flesh, (2) C.aestuarii targeted relatively small mussels due to their small-sized chelae, even though they achieve a larger maximum adult size than the native H.takanoi, (3) large H.takanoi consumed both small and median-sized mussels in equal proportions. Despite the slightly different feeding strategies of the two crabs, the optimal-sized prey for each crab species was similar, indicating a potential for food competition among co-occurring populations of C.aestuarii and H.takanoi in Tokyo Bay.

N2  - In this study, a novel processing technique that minimizes transformation was developed for observing artemia nauplii by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The specimens obtained by this method could be observed under very low to high magnification, and minimal morphological transformation was noted in the larval body or in the setae at the tips of the antennae. The technique involves a combination of chemical fixation and microwave irradiation, ultra-high-vacuum freeze-drying, and osmium coating. It could prevent the formation of a charge at the tips of the setae a phenomenon that often occurs during sample processing for SEM. This method may facilitate research on the morphology of crustacean larvae.

N2  - We report a new species of the semiterrestrial crab of the family Varunidae, Cyclograpsus pumilio Hangai & Fukui, new species, from the coast of Kii Peninsula, western Japan, which occurs underneath cobbles and boulders piled up at the uppermost level of the intertidal zone. This new species is morphologically most similar to Cyclograpsus intermedius that sometimes co-occurs with it, but is distinguished mainly by the swollen anterior part of carapace, the presence of granules and long hairs on the anterior and posterior margins of ambulatory legs, the presence of a concavity on the distal margin of the sixth abdominal segment accommodating the penetrating basal margin of the telson in male, and the slightly curved first pleopod of male.

N2  - Two species of caridean shrimps are newly recorded from hydrothermal vents on the Manus Basin, southwestern Pacific, at depths of 1540-1577m. Lebbeus manus, new species, is related to L.curvirostris Zarenkov, 1976, L.elegans Komai, Hayashi & Kohtsuka, 2004, L.longipes (Kobjakova, 1936), L.vicinus vicinus (Rathbun, 1902) and L.vicinus motereyensis (Wicksten & Mendez, 1982) because of the lack of strap-like epipods on the second and third pereopods; but characters of the rostrum, carapace and abdomen immediately distinguish the new species from the these five taxa. Subadult and juvenile specimens of Nematocarcinus are referred to N.sp.aff.exilis, but their definite identification is postponed until additional specimens become available for study. There are a few minor differences between the present Manus specimens and European specimens representing N.exilis (Bate, 1888), suggesting that the Manus population may indeed represent a separate species.

N2  - Galatheid crabs are one of the dominant macro-invertebrates in interstices of coral rubble. Population characteristics of two species of galatheid crab, Galathea mauritiana Bouvier, 1915 and Coralliogalathea humilis (Nobili, 1905), were examined by using traps filled with coral rubble in a coral lagoon of Ishigaki Island, Japan. The number of C.humilis in the traps did not vary between three areas (back reef, seagrass bed and nearshore) or two seasons (winter and spring), while G.mauritiana was very rare in the seagrass bed. For both G.mauritiana and C.humilis, allometric regression analyses showed that the carapace width against the carapace length of females showed a steeper slope than those of males and that the cheliped length of males showed a steeper slope than those of females. Size frequency histograms showed that the size range expanded and that larger G.mauritiana and C.humilis were found in spring. The proportion of ovigerous females was 36.3% in G.mauritiana and 44.9% in C.humilis. Externae of rhizocephalan parasites were observed in 7.41% of G.mauritiana but none were observed in C.humilis.

N2  - The green mussel, Perna viridis, is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific region but has recently been introduced worldwide. Although the native mussel populations of P.viridis in India suffer from parasitic effects of the pinnotherid crab Arcotheres placunae, there have been no previous reports of pinnotherid crabs in P.viridis in Japan. We investigated pea crab infections in P.viridis and in the native mussels Hormomya mutabilis, Septifer virgatus, and S.bilocularis in Uranouchi Inlet, Kochi Prefecture, Japan. Results showed that the native generalist pea crab A.sinensis utilized the non-indigenous mussel P.viridis. In P.viridis, condition indices of infested mussels were lower than those of uninfected mussels. The prevalence of A.sinensis in P.viridis was low (1-3%) compared to native mussels: H.mutabilis (13%) and S.virgatus (20%). Septifer bilocularis was free from the pea crab.

N2  - Larvae of the Japanese glass shrimp, Pasiphaea japonica Omori, 1976 were described for the first time on the basis of laboratory-reared material. The larvae hatched from incubated eggs detached from pleopods of females collected in Toyama Bay, Japan and were classified into four larval stages based on morphological characteristics. With respect to caridean larval morphology, this species is remarkable for the presence of a small spinule on the opposite side of the long natatory seta below the tip of the exopods of the maxillipeds 2 and 3 at larval stage 1. Newly hatched larvae swam smoothly backwards by means of the maxillipeds, with the telson directed forwards. Decapodids metamorphosed from larvae swam forwards using pleopods. It took 8-13 days to metamorphose to the decapodid stage at 13℃ and 19 days at 10℃, respectively. In contrast, no larva metamorphosed to decapodid stage at 5℃. Feeding behavior was not observed during the larval stages and there were no remarkable change in mandible and maxillule. Moreover, one larva was able to metamorphose to decapodid stage without feeding.

The new species is distinguished from another species of Chiromantes s. str., C. haematocheir (De Haan, 1833), by having proportionately longer and less setose ambulatory legs, a relatively flatter carapace, larger eyes, proportionally narrower front, relatively broader male sixth abdominal segment, less inflated male chela, and distinct colouration. The present study also regards Holometopus serenei as a junior subjective synonym of C. haematocheir.

N2  - While records of seasonal abundance patterns are available for gnathiids (Crustacea, Isopoda, Gnathiidae) in temperate zones and cold water populations, none exist for tropical and subtropical populations. We found the gnathiid isopod Elaphognathia aff. cornigera inhabiting sponges on a subtropical tidal flat in the Haneji Island Sea, Ryukyu Archipelago, southwestern Japan. To examine seasonal abundance patterns of this species, we conducted monthly sampling from December 2004 to November 2006 of the demosponge Haliclona sp. in which the gnathiids dwelled. All of the adult males, adult females in various reproductive phases, and larvae of Elaphognathia aff. cornigera were found throughout most of the year, suggesting that the species reproduces year-round. However, gnathiid density showed a remarkable seasonal pattern, with the maximum abundance occurring in spring and the minimum abundance in summer. These results were quite different from temperate species, in which female development and reproduction are restricted to warmer months and the highest densities are often recorded in the summer. Warm subtropical winters would likely not disturb gnathiid growth and reproduction, but extreme environmental conditions, including summer high water temperatures and typhoons, may affect gnathiid density.

N2  - Vertical distribution and reproductive biology of the hermit crab Pagurus nigrofascia were researched from March 2003 to February 2005 along an intertidal boulder shore in Fukuoka, a warm temperate region of Japan. In the spring, P. nigrofascia was widely distributed throughout the intertidal area but moved to the upper intertidal area in the summer and to the middle intertidal area in the autumn. In the winter, most crabs were found in the lower intertidal area, as many had moved into the subtidal area. Most females produced a brood in March and released larvae in December after an extremely long incubation period of 9 months. From March to October, the embryos were in diapause, and the eggs were completely filled with yolk. In November, all embryos began to develop, and most broods hatched in December. New recruits appeared in March and April and grew slowly. These reproductive characteristics of P. nigrofascia were similar to those observed in a previous study in Hakodate, a cold temperate region of Japan. However, in Fukuoka, brood production and larval release occurred approximately 2 months earlier and females exhibited higher fecundity than in Hakodate.

N2  - Four species of squat lobsters (Galathea amboinensis de Man, 1888, G. continua new species, G. inflata Potts, 1915, and G. leptocheir new species), all associates of comatulid crinoids, are described from material collected on coral reefs of the Ryukyu Islands. Galathea continua is found in association with Capillaster multiradiatus, Clarkcomanthus littoralis, Comatella maculata, C. nigra, C. stelligera, and Comanthus gisleni. It is distinguished from the other three species by the absence of a spine on the hepatic region lateral to the first transverse ridge of the carapace, the anterior margin of sternite 3 submedially produced into two spines instead of roughly bilobed, and epipods present on pereopod 1 only instead of pereopods 1-3. Galathea leptocheir associated with Phanogenia gracilis is distinguished from G. amboinensis by much more slender pereopod 1, the carapace with four uninterrupted and three interrupted transverse ridges placed alternately instead of one interrupted and six uninterrupted ridges on the posterior half surface, and abdominal somites 2-4 with two uninterrupted instead of three uninterrupted transverse ridges. Coloration is also different in each of these species. A key to the four species is provided.

N2  - Ilyoplax pusilla has been known to exhibit a unique mudusing territorial behavior termed barricade building. Most of the barricade builders are large males that can pair with females, which suggests that the barricade is built by males to aid courtship. We conducted this study to clarify whether the barricade building improves mating success. Barricade abundance and waving frequency was highest in June, corresponding to the peak of male courtship behavior. Males that paired with females built barricades significantly more frequently than did neighboring males that did not pair with females. These results suggest that barricading in I. pusilla enhances in pair formation.

N2  - Allocation of energy between reproduction and growth is a fundamental principle in life history theory. In a seasonal environment, animals with indeterminate growth are predicted to change their allocation between reproduction and growth according to the season. We examined the seasonal variation in the allocation to reproduction and growth within a breeding season in the hermit crab Pagurus nigrivittatus. Females of P. nigrivittatus produced smaller clutches during the early part of the reproductive period than later although the frequency of prenuptial molting was lower early in the period. We suggest that environmental factors, such as temperature, may affect the development rate of embryos, as well as the metabolism and surplus energy in females, which have consequences for seasonal variation in the energy allocation to reproduction and growth.

N2  - We analyzed a total of 3,784 young fiddler crabs of Uca arcuata (De Haan, 1833) with carapace widths (CW) between 1.45 and 9.95mm, collected from a site on the Ohno River in Central Kyushu, Japan. All crabs with CW<3.0mm possessed two small symmetrical chelipeds. Young male crabs with a CW between 3.0 and 6.0mm exhibited one of four stages of cheliped differentiation: 1) two small chelipeds; 2) two large chelipeds; 3) only one cheliped; and 4) asymmetrical chelipeds (one large and one small). We identified 646 male and 632 female crabs with a CW between 6.0 and 9.95mm. No statistical difference from the 1:1 ratio is evident. We conclude that the basic sex ratio for U. arcuata is unity.

N2  - Surface structures of Pugettia quadridens and P. intermedia were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Both crabs attach pieces of sea algae to six hooked setae sites on the carapace. In addition to the hooked setae, the crabs develop plate setae, which cover the entire surface except the tips of the chelae. The plate setae of P. quadridens were flat and played no role in decoration, whereas those of P. intermedia were variously modified in shape. For example, the setae on the abdominal carapace surface were flat, whereas those on the walking legs and the dorsal carapace were conical and in some cases considerably elongated. These modified plate setae served as attachment sites for algae and other small materials on the carapace and walking legs, blurring the outline of P. intermedia.

N2  - An intersexual phenomenon was observed in male specimens of the freshwater crab Geothelphusa dehaani, where a female genital opening (gonopore) was present. The androgenic gland of the intersexual male crab was examined. Electron microscopic observations revealed that the cell structure of the androgenic glands of the intersexual male crab is different from that of a normal crab, suggesting that the androgenic gland controls the external sexual characteristics.

N2  - The paired Y-organs and mandibular organs of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, which are located in the cephalothorax, continue to be subjects of intense research interest. The mandibular organs of this crayfish are much more conspicuous than the Y-organs. Herein, the ultrastructure of these organs during several stages of the molt cycle is described. Mitochondria with tubular cristae and Golgi complex in Y-organ cells are evident at the premolt. Changes are more marked in the Y-organ than in the mandibular organ.

N2  - Feeding habits of the glass shrimps Pasiphaea japonica found in Toyama Bay of the Sea of Japan were studied. Once a month between April and November 2004, specimens were collected by commercial boat seining in the fishing grounds of P. japonica in Toyama Bay. In the laboratory, 50 shrimps were selected randomly, and the foreguts were eviscerated under a stereoscopic microscope. The results showed that P. japonica fed on mysids, euphausiids, other crustaceans (copepods, amphipods, P. japonica, unidentified crustaceans), fishes, and cephalopods. Among these, mysids and euphausiids made up the main diet of P. japonica. It is expected that P. japonica feeds on mysids near the sea bottom, because mesopelagic mysids were not dominant in the fishing grounds. As P. japonica grew, mysids became the main prey. Euphausiids are prey on which P. japonica feeds during the summer, especially in August and September. Euphausiids were consumed regardless of body size of P. japonica.

N2  - Complete larval development of the mountain river prawn, Macrobrachium latimanus (Von Martens, 1868), is described and illustrated from laboratory-reared material. The larval development comprises eleven zoeal and one decapodid stages. The larval stages each are easily distinguished by the morphology of the pereiopods and/or the pleopods, and by the uropod setation. Among Japanese Macrobrachium species, the first zoeal morphology of M. latimanus is most similar to that of M. equidens (Dana, 1852), but differs in the chromatophore patterns of the third and fourth abdominal segments. The morphology and developmental pattern of the subsequent larval stages (the second to final zoeal stages) of M. latimanus and other 16 amphidromous congeners, whose larval development was previously described, are reviewed. The zoeal morphologies of Macrobrachium species can be separated into two groups by the presence/absence of pair of posterolateral spines on the fifth abdominal segments in the second to final zoeal stages. Macrobrachium latimanus belongs to the group that has no spines on the fifth abdominal segment.

N2  - We used a scanning electron microscope to study the minor claw and the first and second maxillipeds of Uca vocans and Uca tetragonon. Uca vocans had a slender, narrow minor claw with a wider gape, while U. tetragonon had a stout, broad claw with a narrower gape. In both species, sexual differences were slight in the lengths of the dactyl and propodus, and breadth of the minor claw. However, males of both species had deeper chelae than the females. Uca vocans had larger maxillipeds, appendages adapted to process large amounts of substratum, than U. tetragonon. Both species had spoonshaped setae on the inner side of the merus of the second maxillipeds, although U. vocans had more numerous setae, with larger spoon-shaped heads, than U. tetragonon. In both species, females scooped substratum more frequently using both chelipeds than the males, and produced a larger number of sand pellets. However, no sexual dimorphism was detected in the sizes and structures of the first and second maxillipeds.

N2  - Social behaviors were observed in the field for six grapsoid crabs living under different habitat conditions from exposed to sheltered conditions, i.e. Helice tridens, H. japonica, H. leachi, Chasmagnathus convexus of the family Varunidae, and Chiromantes dehaani, and Perisesarma bidens of the family Sesarmidae. Fighting behaviors in these six species, cheliped-displays in H. tridens, H. japonica and P. bidens, and copulatory behaviors in H. tridens, C. dehaani and P. bidens were described. Elements of fighting behavior varied among species irrespective of taxonomic group. The three species that showed cheliped-displays occurred in more exposed habitats compared to the other species, suggesting the importance of habitat conditions in the evolution of such displays. Copulatory behaviors were observed in three species, but precopulatory courtship was absent.

N2  - The decorating behavior of 17 newly molted individuals of the majid crab Hyastenus diacanthus (De Haan, 1837) was recorded on VTR. The crabs attached various living materials to hooked setae on the carapace and walking legs after careful selection by the chelae and processing with the mouthparts. The crabs used chelipeds in a fixed way in the attachment process. Except for the horn and spots on the carapace, the crabs attached materials using the chelipeds of the opposite side. Newly molted crabs had almost finished attachment within 2 hours, but the crabs continued to work sporadically for another 1 or 2 hours. The average frequency of attachments was 91 (N=7). The hooked setae cover only a portion of the body, and other areas, except for the tips of the chelae, are covered with barbed setae. The barbed setae hold the materials, which grow outside of the hooked setae sites. The crabs were indifferent to the settlement of larvae of sessile animals, such as barnacles, and did not remove them. Consequently, portions of the crabs were covered with sessile animals. The slender setae on the dactyl of walking legs and the short setae in the pits of chelae are likely sensory organs to detect suitable materials for attachment.

Alox rugosum is perhaps most similar to the new species, but Alox uru differs in its carapace shape and the distally swollen male first gonopod. Alox zalion too has distally swollen male first gonopod, but A. uru differs from A. zalion in having the male first gonopod distally spinose. Ebalia stellaris, new species, is distinguished from E. humilis by the characters of the carapace and the cheliped. Ebalia stellaris can be also differentiated from Nursia species by a combination of carapacial characters-lack of dorsal ridge, a salient junction of anterolateral and posterolateral margins, and a distinctly wider carapace.

N2  - Complete larval development of a scyllarine lobster, Galearctus kitanoviriosus (Harada, 1962), is described and illustrated from laboratory-reared material. The development comprises nine phyllosoma stages and one nisto stage. Nistos appeared 52-59 days and first stage juveniles 65-77 days after hatching, under rearing conditions with 24.3-25.5℃ water temperature and a salinity of 34.0-35.0‰. The morphological characteristics of phyllosoma and nisto stages were compared with those of other scyllarine larvae, which were also described from laboratory-reared materials. Galearctus kitanoviriosus phyllosomas can be differentiated from other species by characteristics of the cephalon, maxillule, and pereiopods. The nistos of G. kitanoviriosus can also be distinguished from those of Chelarctus cultrifer (Ortmann, 1897) and Petrarctus demani (Holthuis, 1946) by the armature and setation of the antenna, maxillule, and abdominal segments.

N2  - The life history of a cirolanid isopod, Excirolana chiltoni Richardson, 1905, was studied on a sandy beach in Sendai Bay, northern Japan, during the period October 1996 to March 1998. Cohort analyses indicated two or three age groups in each sample with a life span estimated at 2 years. The growth rate was high in the warm season and low in winter. The breeding season lasted from early April through to late September. Two-year-old females began to carry embryos earlier, followed by the smaller 1-year-olds. Excirolana chiltoni showed spatial segregation during the breeding season. Namely, ovigerous females occurred on the high shore and juveniles were closest to sea. Thus, E. chiltoni utilize environmental gradients along the beach face slope on sandy beaches throughout their life history.

N2  - Coutieralpheus, new genus, is established for C. setirostris, new species, on the basis of two specimens, a complete male and an incomplete female, collected from burrows on the tidal flats bordering Fort Pierce Inlet on the Atlantic coast of Florida, U.S.A. The new genus belongs to a large group of alpheid genera characterized by the presence of a posteroventral articulated plate on the sixth abdominal pleuron. The holotype male bears robust, subsymmetrical and equal-sized chelipeds. The mesial side of the cheliped carpus bears several rows of short setae, which are present in only three other, non-related alpheid genera. The two thickened terminal setae on the rostrum are also diagnostic. Coutieralpheus appears to combine primitive and highly evolved features and is presumably related to the monotypic genus Deioneus Dworschak, Anker & Abed-Navandi from the Eastern Atlantic. However, in some characters the new genus also resembles the genera Salmoneus Holthuis, Alpheopsis Coutiere and Parabetaeus Coutiere. The host of C. setirostris remains unknown, although both the holotype and paratype were collected from substrates richly burrowed by thalassinidean shrimp, stomatopods, and large polychaetes.

N2  - A poorly known pagurid hermit crab, Alainopaguroides andamanensis McLaughlin, 2002, is recorded from Japanese and Indonesian waters for the first time. This species was only recently described from the Andaman Sea near Phuket, Thailand. The original description of the species was based on small, damaged specimens, and therefore a supplemental description based on the newly obtained specimens is provided. A sufficient comparison with the other congeneric species, A. lemaitrei McLaughlin, 1997, is now possible. Alainopaguroides andamanensis was found to use halves of bivalve shells as protective coverings.

N2  - In the Ariake-Sound estuarine system, intertidal sandflats or sandy beaches inhabited by Nihonotrypaea harmandi are distributed along the western half of the coastline. In these habitats, the ghost shrimp occupies zones or patches mostly composed of moderately (well) sorted fine sand. A previous study has identified 38 local shrimp populations along the coastline. Of these, 26 main populations were surveyed to estimate their sizes prior to the breeding season in 1998. For each location, the shrimp-inhabited zones/patches were mapped, and density was assessed by counting the number of burrow openings at a number of stations. The total number of shrimps at each zone/patch was estimated by multiplying the mean shrimp density by its area. The entire population size was given as the sum total of those from all zones/patches. Of all local populations, the population size on one sand flat situated at the southwestern periphery of the target waters was by far the largest due to both the highest density and the largest area, accounting for 70% of the total number of shrimps in the estuarine system. This sand flat is closest to the largest larval retention ground in the waters lying 10 to 20km offshore.

A total of 108 individuals was collected and analysed. The sex ratio did not differ from 1:1 and sexual size dimorphism was not evident. Laomedia astacina was heterochelous, with the major claw slightly larger and stouter than the minor claw. The proportions of right and left major claws did not differ significantly from 1:1 and did not change with shrimp size. Both sexes exhibited a positive allometry in both cheliped types. Sexual dimorphism was observed in the width of the abdomen, but not observed in the chelipeds.

N2  - The five zoeal stages and megalopa larvae of the Japanese mitten crab Eriocheir japonica were reared using natural sea water in the laboratory at Tsuyazaki, Fukuoka Prefecture from September 1990 to July 1991. The timetable of larval development in the natural population was estimated from the results of incubation under ambient temperature. Duration of development increased as the water temperature decreased from autumn to winter, and all larvae were dead in 1st or 2nd zoea stage from December to April when water temperature was lower than 15℃. The duration of development of zoea larvae and megalopa larvae varied from 15 (hatched in June) to 89 days (November) and from 5 (emerged in June or July) to 13 days (October), respectively. Larval development is completed from autumn to winter by broods hatched from the early maturing group which spawned three times from September to December, and from spring to early summer from later maturing group which spawned three times after December. The settlement of a large number of larvae spawned by the later maturing group in early summer is expected. This estimation agrees closely with the observed settlement pattern of megalopa larvae in the upper tidal river.

N2  - Females of the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804) possess a pair of cuticular genitalia in the oviducts, which are renewed at each non-parturial molt. The genitalia consist of a distal segment surrounding the gonopore, and a cuticular tube lining the lumen of the oviduct. At parturial molt, however, adult females do not produce new genitalia. Their genitalia are only modified. Moreover, egg-carrying females possess new genitalia after each parturial molt. The timing of formation of new genitalia after the parturial molt is still indistinct. The process was investigated morphologically around the time of oviposition. After the parturial molt, females retain only the cuticular tubes of the old genitalia in the oviducts. Several hours after molting and just before oviposition, these cuticular tubes are cast off from the oviducts and a pair of oopores opens on the coxal plate of the fifth perionite. After oviposition, the oopores become gradually unobservable with time. New genitalia are not present in the oviducts until at least 24 hours after the parturial molt. The reconstruction of new genitalia seems to be associated with the disappearance of the oopores.

N2  - A new species of caridean shrimp, Pseudocheles neutra sp.nov. is described from Sulawesi, Indonesia. The new species can be distinguished from its congeners by a suite of characters, including the presence of a distinct tooth on the posterolateral margin of the fifth pleuron, as well as several differences in spination. A new family, Pseudochelidae is created to accommodate the genus. This family can be distinguished from the Bresiliidae and Alvinocarididae in the presence of well developed exopods on the ambulatory pereiopods and the fusion of the ischium and merus of the first and second pereiopods, and from the Disciadidae primarily in the absence of a disc-shaped dactylus of the first pereiopod. The new family differs from all known Caridean families in the presence of pseudochelate ambulatory pereiopods.

N2  - We examined a new method that used a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution to extract all sperm from spermatophores of the spiny king crab Paralithodes brevipes (H. Milne Edwards and Lucas, 1841). Spermatophores were put into 1ml microtubes containing 0.25ml of 20% NaOH solution. After soaking in the NaOH solution for 10, 30, 60 and 90 min, the microtubes were mixed for 30 sec. The mixed solution was then placed in a hemacytometer, and sperm were counted under an optical microscope. The total number of extracted sperm in each microtube was calculated: (number of sperm counted/volume of NaOH counted)×total volume. The number of extracted sperm increased with time soaked until 60 min. The number of extracted sperm showed no significant increase between soaking time of 60 min and 90 min, which indicates all spermatophores were completely dissolved by 60 min. Sperm cells kept the body but not spines of sperm in NaOH solution even after 180 min after mixing. Therefore, to extract sperm, spermatophores should be agitated after 60 min of soaking in 20% NaOH solution, and sperm should be counted within 3 hours after mixing.

N2  - Two species of the rare mud shrimp genus Naushonia Kingsley, 1897 (Thalassinidea: Laomediidae) are reported from Japanese waters. Naushonia japonica, new species, described based on a single male specimen from Shimonoseki, southwestern Honshu, is similar to N. perrieri (Nobili, 1904) known only from the Red Sea. They are differentiated by the armature of the rostrum and anterolateral margin of the carapace, development of the second lateral carina on the gastric region of the carapace, armature of the antennal scale and shape of the dactylus of the first pereopod. Naushonia lactoalbida Berggren, 1992, originally described from Mozambique, East Africa, is recorded from Iriomote Island, southern Ryukyu Islands. The record of species of Naushonia in the western Pacific region has been represented only by planktonic zoeas of an unidentified species taken at Gokasho Bay, central Japan (Konishi, 2001). The occurrence of species of Naushonia in the region is now fully confirmed by the discovery of the adult specimens.

The gnathiid is the 20th species of the family Gnathiidae and 8th of the genus Gnathia recorded from Japan. Males of G. camuripenis have remarkably large penes fused into a single crooked blade and mandibles with 2 inner lobes, and thus are easily separated from its congeners. Female adults and larvae considered to be the same species are also described in detail and the morphology of antennae, mouthparts and pleotelson compared to other species from the same family.

N2  - We performed a histological investigation of the different stages of development of primordial externae in the interna of Polyascus polygenea Glenner, Lutzen et Takahashi, 2003, a common parasite of an intertidal crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus (de Haan, 1835). Development of the primordia begins with budding of the interna and the formation of numerous nuclei, i.e. clusters of non-differentiated embryonic cells surrounded by an epithelial layer. The non-differentiated cells of the nuclei undergo intensive mitotic reproduction. After the stage of cell proliferation, the processes of epithelial morphogenesis in the primordial externae and the related anlagen of the trophic system were observed. The primordial ovary in the developing externae already comprises primary germ cells and later, oogonia and oocytes. Careful and thorough investigations of morphogenesis in primordial externae support our previous results and agree with the findings of other authors.

N2  - Allocleaning, fighting, waving and mating behavior in 16 species of Macrophthalmus (Brachyura, Macrophthalmidae) are described from field observations. Allocleaning was performed in most species observed, except M. latifrons. Male-male fighting behavior could be divided into two patterns; grasping fight and claw-extending fight. The latter was observed in five species, across three subgenera, most species exhibiting grasping fight behavior. Both fight patterns usually started with leg touching/pushing, followed by mounting and grasping. Fights usually ended with grasping, but in the claw-extending pattern, lateral extension of the chelipeds in both combatants occurred after grasping. Fighting behavior between females could be divided into two patterns; legintertwining fight and leg-extending fight, the latter being observed only in two species of subgenus Macrophthalmus. Most species exhibited leg-intertwining fight. Male waving display could be classified into four patterns, including vertical non-forward-pointing type, vertical forward-pointing type, lateral non-forward-pointing type and lateral forward-pointing type, depending upon in cheliped movement. The differences between the four waving patterns involve the chelipeds being moved either vertically or laterally, and extended forward while raised or not. Lateral movement was observed in only three species, M. banzai, M. erato and M. quadratus, most species exhibiting vertical movement. Forward-pointing movements were observed in four species, but were absent in all species of subgenus Mareotis and two species of subgenus Macrophthalmus. The most common waving display was the vertical non-forward-pointing type. Mating behavior of six species was observed (surface mating). Underground mating, reported for other macrophthalmine crabs, was not observed during the field observations.

N2  - Two new species of hippolytid shrimp, Lebbeus elegans sp. nov. and L. polyacanthus sp. nov., are described from the Sea of Japan, at depths of 250-400m. Lebbeus elegans is characterized by the absence of epipods on the second and third pereopods, distinct ventral blade of the rostrum and the rounded fourth abdominal pleuron. Lebbeus polyacanthus is compared with L. antarcticus (Hale, 1941), L. carinatus Zarenkov, 1976, and L. washingtonianus (Rathbun, 1902). Lebbeus polyacanthus differs from the latter three species in the more posteriorly arising posteriormost tooth of the dorsal rostral series and more numerous lateral spines on the meri of the third to fifth pereopods. Examination of the newly obtained material of L. kuboi Hayashi, 1992, enabled us to assess intraspecific variations of the species, including a variation in the development of the pereopodal epipods. Redescription of Lebbeus kuboi is provided and its affinity is discussed. These three species occur sympatrically. A brief note on the taxonomy and distribution of species of Lebbeus is also provided.

N2  - Maturation of female Japanese mitten crabs Eriocheir japonica (De Haan, 1835) was observed and the relationship between maturity and reproductive ecology investigated. The degree of maturity was indicated by juvenile and adult phases from their exoskeleton, gonad index (GI), six developmental stages of oocyte from histological observation, oocyte diameter, and four developmental stages of embryos. The stages of most advanced oocytes were used for assessing ovarian maturity. During the juvenile stage the ovary proceeds to previtellogenesis and primary vitellogenesis but remains immature (at most stage 2, GI < 1.0, oocytes < 100μm diameter). After the pubertal moult, oocytes begin secondary vitellogenesis, and complete development (stages 2-6, GI 0.28-13.2, 120-400μm diameter). The number of developing oocytes varied from ca. 120,000 (40mm at carapace width) to 650,000 (70mm). Copulation is estimated to be possible only when adult females complete vitellogenesis. After oviposition, underdeveloped oocytes start secondary vitellogenesis with the development of embryos, and are spawned as the second or third broods after fertilization by stocked sperm without ecdysis. Most of the developing oocytes are spawned at each oviposition, and unspawned matured oocytes are considered to be digested and absorbed.

N2  - This study dealt with the egg development and incubation period of the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus reared in the laboratory. Egg volume increased twice throughout development and the rate of increment was higher after the metanaupliar stage. Two embryonic growth indices which were expressed as respective relative areas of embryonic body and eye pigment in lateral profiles of the egg increased as the relative egg age advanced. Newly hatched larvae body size correlated with egg size. Smallersized larvae tended to be produced at higher egg incubation temperatures. The number of days from spawning to hatching decreased with increasing incubation temperature and the Belehradek's equation was the best non-linear regression model to describe the relationship between temperature and egg incubation period.

N2  - The first zoeas of six Japanese Macrobrachium species, M. equidens (Dana, 1852), M. formosense (Bate, 1868), M. grandimanus (Randall, 1840), M. japonicum (De Haan, 1849), M. lar (Fabricius, 1798) and M. nipponense (De Haan, 1849), are redescribed from specimens hatched in the laboratory. The first zoeas described here differ considerably from previous published descriptions in appendage morphology and chromatophore pattern. The present examination demonstrates that, except for M. shokitai Fujino & Baba, 1973, first zoeal morphology among the seven Japanese species can be distinguished by using the combined characteristics of chromatophore pattern and the armatures of the mandibles, maxillule, and third abdominal segment.

N2  - Reproductive characters and population structure of the intertidal hermit crab, Pagurus proximus Komai, 2000, are described, based on samples collected monthly from Hakodate Bay, southern Hokkaido, Japan. Males were larger than females and the sex ratios of small and large crabs were female and male biased, respectively, although the overall sex ratio was not significantly biased from the 1:1 ratio. Ovigerous females were observed from February to July in 1999 and from January to June in 2000. At 12 and 16℃, the ovigerous period was 40.3 (±0.58 SD) and 30.8 (±1.62 SD) days, respectively. Some females may have multiple clutches per year based on egg developmental pattern in the field and the ovigerous periods.

N2  - The larval development of Galathea amboinensis De Man, 1888, a galatheid symbiotic with comatulid crinoids, is described and illustrated from laboratory-reared material. This species had four zoeal stages and one megalopal stage. The larval morphology of G. amboinensis is compared with that of other congeneric species for which the complete larval development is known: G. inflata Potts, 1915, G. rostrata A. Milne Edwards, 1880 and G. intermedia Lilljeborg, 1851. The zoeas of G. amboinensis are much like those of G. inflata, but distinctive in the absence of small spines on the posterodorsal margin of the second to fifth abdominal segments. The megalop of G. amboinensis also resembles that of G. inflata, but differs in segmentation of the antennal flagellum and setation of the mandibular palp, and in having circular or subcircular red spots on the carapace and abdomen.

N2  - The larval development of the semiterrestrial sesarmid mangrove crab Neosarmatium indicum (A. Milne Edwards, 1868) was studied under laboratory conditions at salinities 0-35‰ and temperatures of 25.5-27.5℃. The larval development consists of five zoeal stages and a megalopa. Larvae survived to the first crab stage at salinities between 5 and 35‰ with different percentages. At the 0‰, the larvae died within 12 hours without moulting to subsequent stages. Total duration of development to the first crab stage was 45, 38, 34, 30, 28, 35 and 40 days at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35‰, respectively. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in the survival rate were found among the tested salinities. The best survival rate for each larval stage was recorded at 20 and 25‰.

N2  - The responses of the larvae of the rhizocephalan barnacle Sacculina polygenea, a parasite of the intertidal crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus, to different temperatures and salinities were examined. Its development comprises five naupliar stages and the cypris stage. The phototaxis of the nauplii remained undisturbed at 22℃ and 26-34‰. The number of true naupliar moults decreased at lowering of temperature and salinity. Successful naupliar development occurred in temperature and salinity ranges of 1825℃ and 18-34‰ respectively. At 20-25℃ and the optimum salinity of 24-28‰, development to the cypris stage took 2-3 d. Under the most severe conditions imposed (15℃ and 18‰) the cyprids appeared in 6.5 d. The cypris larvae showed wider tolerance range against decreased salinity than the naupliar stages. At 1520℃ and 14-34‰, 85-95% of cyprids died hi 7 d. In the tolerance to different salinities S. polygenea larvae occupy an intermediate position between those of estuarine and marine species. The continuous presence of planktonic cypris larvae in wide range of temperature and salinity represents a potential infestation hazard for the host crabs.

N2  - In Armadillidium vulgare, the female external genitalia (cuticular copulatory apparatus) consist of a copulatory opening and a spermathecal duct. Adult females change the structure of the genitalia at molting during a reproductive cycle. This study was done to investigate the relationship between the structural change of the genitalia and their reconstruction at the non-parturial (normal) and parturial (reproductive) molts. When females have immature ovaries at molting, they completely cast off the genitalia, together with the old exoskeleton, and reconstruct new genitalia of a non-reproductive type. On the other hand, females with mature ovaries cast off the copulatory openings together with the old exoskeleton at parturial molting. However, the old spermathecal ducts are retained in the oviducts through and after molting. In females with mature ovaries, new genitalia of a reproductive type are not reconstructed at the parturial molt. The present observations demonstrate that adult females change the structure of the genitalia at molting in accordance with the degree of ovarian maturation. The non-reproductive type genitalia are reconstructed at the nonparturial molt but the reproductive type genitalia are not reconstructed at the time of the parturial molt in A. vulgare.

N2  - The larval development of the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium australe (Guerin Meneville, 1838) is described and illustrated from laboratory-reared material. Although all larvae died before attaining the decapodid stage, thirteen zoeal stages were recognized. Morphological comparisons between the thirteenth zoea of M. australe and the last zoeal stages ofM. carcinus and M. rosenbergii indicate that M. australe possibly has at least one more zoeal stage before metamorphosis. The morphology of the first zoea ofM. australe is also compared with that of 7 other Japanese species. The present species most closely agrees with that of M. grandimanus, but it differs from the latter by the setation of the mandibles, maxillule, and second and third maxillipeds. Zoeas of M. australe survived for nearly 150 days, and presumably did not have a suitable settlement environment. This extended larval period may be one important factor explaining why this species is ubiquitously distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific region.

N2  - During a taxonomic study of the snapping shrimp genus Alpheus from Japan and the Gulf of Thailand, it has been found that two species have been confounded under A. digitalis De Haan, 1844, which was originally described based on a single specimen possessing abnormal chelipeds. Differences between the two species are found in both morphology and coloration. Careful examination of published information of the holotype and supplemental material enable us to establish the true identity of A. digitalis. The new species, A. longiforceps, can be distinguished from A. digitalis by the more slender major chela with a sinuous, rather than convex, flexor margin, the longer male minor chela with a more elongate dactylus, and the possession of a single, rather than two, obliquely transverse white bands on the carapace and of a conspicuous dark brown spot on the lateral surface of the fourth abdominal tergum.

According to Gore's (1985) classification of the developmental types of decapods, the development of P. nipponensis is of an advanced and lecithotrophic type.

Parabetaeus culliereti appears to exhibit large variation in the development of the rostrum and orbital teeth. This type of variation has not been previously reported in the family Alpheidae. As a result, the genus Neoalpheopsis Banner, 1953 is synonymized with Parabetaeus, and a new combination, Parabetaeus euryone (De Man, 1910) is proposed. Differences between P. culliereti and P. euryone are also discussed.

N2  - The shell use pattern between sexes of Pagurus filholi was described, at Kattoshi, northern Japan. Line transect sampling showed that the shells available to P. filholi in this area were mainly composed of four species, Reticunassa fraterculus, Homalopoma sangarense, Batillaria cumingi and Littorina brevicula. The former three shell species were used by small crabs, and the pattern of shell use significantly differed between sexes. Almost all large crabs of either sex used Littorina brevicula shell. The abundance of empty shells was about 10% of total hermit abundance. Shell size suitability of crabs decreased as crab size increased, suggesting that shell limitation was more severe in large-sized crabs than in small ones. However, this trend differed between sexes. Males used unsuitable-sized shell relative to similar-sized females in Reticunassa and Homalopoma species. The population sex ratio was biased towards females, and showed an anomalous pattern as a function of crab size that was initially from male bias to female bias with increasing size, but was biased towards males again with a further increase in size. Sexual differences in shell preference, competitive ability and growth rate were discussed as causal explanations for the present pattern.

N2  - Annual reproductive cycle of the helmet crab Telmessus cheiragonus was investigated based on the histological observations of the ovary and the gonadosomatic indices (GSI = ovarian weight x 100 / body weight). The ovarian maturity was divided into five phases (Phase I-V). Minimum mature size of female was 36.0 mm in carapace length. The annual reproductive cycle in the adult females (more than 36.0 mm carapace length) consisted of the incubating period (October-March) and the maturing period (April-September). During the incubating period, the ovarian maturity was Phase I-II (mean GSI±SD = 3.8±4.7 %) when most of the females were ovigerous. During the maturing period, the ovarian maturity increased to Phase V (GSI &le; 21.6 %) when the females seemed to be frequently copulating, because the soft shell adult females, which could copulate, occurred with highest frequency. The spawning of most females seemed to occur at the end of the maturing period. These results suggest that the ovarian maturation cycle requires one year, and during the incubation period ovaries are immature.

N2  - One of the three syntypes of Pagurus lepidochirus (Doflein, 1902) was reexamined. This female syntype was found to possess paired first pleopods modified as gonopods, broadly separated ocular acicles and subequal chelipeds, suggesting reassignment of this species to either the genus Nematopagurus A. Milne-Edwards & Bouvier, 1892, or to Ceratopagurus Yokoya, 1933. Study of supplemental material has revealed the presence of a long, filamentous right sexual tube in males, requiring reassignment of this species to Nematopagurus,_ Further comparisons have shown that Doflein's taxon is identical with a species reported from Japanese waters as N. squamichelis Alcock, 1905.

N2  - The purpose of this series of papers is to clarify the identity of each Calcinus species from Japan and adjacent waters and to establish a descriptive catalogue of the species. There has been much and serious taxonomic confusion and misidentifications in the literature. This report considers Calcinus pulcher Forest and C. lineapropodus Morgan & Forest. Since the original as well as subsequent descriptions of C. pulcher have been brief and insufficient, a detailed redescription and illustrations are provided. Confusion between C. pulcher and C. anani is clarified. Calcinus lineapropodus, a species very closely related to C. pulcher, and a taxonomic enigma in Japanese literature, is redescribed in detail. Minor but reliable morphological distinctions between C. pulcher and C. lineapropodus are provided. Mouthparts of the two species are described for the first time.

N2  - The complete larval development of Galathea inflata Potts, 1915, a symbiont of comatulid crinoids, is described and illustrated from laboratoryreared material. The zoeas of G. inflata are easily distinguished from those of G. rostrata and G. intermedia by an abdomen, including a telson, that is covered with very minute spines in all zoeal stages, a rostrum that bears lateral teeth in the second to fifth zoeal stages, and by the setations of the maxillule and first and second maxillipeds. This species had five zoeal stages and one megalopal stage. However, the fifth zoeal stage may be abnormal because it possesses a mixture of zoeal and megalopal characters. It is suggested that the fourth stage zoeas possibly molt directly to the megalopa under favorable conditions.

N2  - We performed short-term cultivation of alive interna fragments of Sacculina polygenea Liitzen & Takahashi, 1997 isolated from the organism of its host, the coastal crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus (De Haan) and studied the histology of parasitic interna and their relationships with the gut and gonads of the host. It is shown that the colonial interna of S. polygenea comprises an extensive trophic system (roots and trunks) and a reproductive system represented by numerous primordia of externae at different stages of development. We observed asexual reproduction (blastogenesis) in the interna beginning with the development of numerous nuclei, dense aggregations of non-differentiated embryonic cells surrounded by a simple epithelium; later on each nucleus develops a primordium of a trophic module. An ovary with paired colleteric glands, paired male receptacles, and mantle with inner cavity and mantle opening arise in the anlagen of externae prior to their emerging to body surface of the crab, i.e., in the interna. The process of oogenesis begins in the primordium of the ovary; in late primordial externae we have found vitellogenic oocytes. Cells performing functions of ingestion, treatment, and accumulation of nutrients are located in the distal parts (rootlets) of the trophic system; the cells filled with nutrients then release the latter into root lumen, where the nutrients are conveyed toward the primordia and, later on, adult externae. Thus, we have visualized the colonial structure of S. polygenea interim comprising numerous elements of reproductive and trophic systems.

N2  - Examination of the morphology and distribution of setae of Pugettia quadridens quadridens, using SEM and stereomicroscopy reveals two types of setae (hooked and simple) distributed in different areas on the dorsal surface of the carapace. Hooked setae bear regularly arranged oblique striae with both spinules and a median groove along the inner curve. These setae are loosely arranged in double rows along the rostrum, in the orbital region, and at the anterolateral border of the carapace. Simple setae are not curved and are found in the gastric, mesobranchial and intestinal regions of the carapace. The distribution of hooked setae on the carapace varies considerably according to crab size and sex. They are more widely distributed on the dorsal carapace of smaller crabs than on larger ones, and on females compared to males. These spider crabs can be classified into four types based on setal distribution pattern.

N2  - Based on material collected from shallow hydrothermal vent fields in Kagoshima Bay, southern Japan, a new species of the sub family Pontoniinae, Periclimenes thermohydrophilus, is described and illustrated. A combination of several characters distinguishes the present new species from all other members of this genus. A short and narrow rostrum without basal crest, an isolated epigastric spine, a submarginal antennal spine and a long carpus of the second pereopod are characteristics of the new species. The relationship between this shrimp and host tube worms is briefly discussed.

N2  - Two new species of Tortanus (Atortus), T. (A.) ampliramus and T. (A.) nishidai, are described from the northern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, respectively. These new species evidently belong to the recticauda species group in the recticauda species complex. The species group has a distinct distribution in the western Indian Ocean, extending from South Africa. The functional morphology of spermatophores of Tortanus is also discussed. A semelparous reproductive strategy may be employed in some species of Tortanus, whereas others adopt an iteroparous strategy as do most of centropagoideans. The formation of swarms was found exclusively in the subgenus Atortus which inhabits clear waters. Swarms of T. (A.) erabuensis may utilize swarms of another small copepod, Oithona oculata as prey.

N2  - The period during postembryonic development in which the androgenic gland hormone can masculinize female secondary characters was studied, with emphasis on the sexually undifferentiated period, in Armadillidium vulgare. Genetic females were implanted with androgenic glands at various developmental stages to induce masculinization. Instead of injection of androgenic gland extracts, androgenic glands were implanted after treatment with ethanol. Each genetic female received a total of three gland implants at stages 2-8. Masculinization of female endopodites of the first pair of abdominal legs was used to show sensitivity to the androgenic gland hormone. All the female recipients showed at least some masculinization of their endopodites at the first and second molts after receiving the implants regardless of the developmental stages. However, masculinization of their endopodites did not continue at subsequent molts. Only the genetic females, which received implants during the sex differentiation period, had endopodites that had fully developed into male copulatory organs. These results show that the secondary sexual characters of genetic females are sensitive to the androgenic gland hormone not only during the sex differentiation period but also during the sexually undifferentiated period. The effects of the androgenic gland implants on female secondary characters and gonadal development are discussed and an ovary-differentiating factor is hypothesized.

N2  - The body sizes of individuals of the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium nipponense at sexual maturity (1year-old females) were investigated in 23 local populations residing in diverse environments from estuaries to inland fresh waters. The body size of females at maturity was significantly smaller in populations inhabiting fresh waters (37.5 mm in modal body length), owing to the slower growth of individuals, than that found in populations inhabiting brackish-water lakes (57.5 mm) or estuaries (52.5 mm). In the laboratory, however, females from an estuarine population spawned at a body size much smaller (37.5 mm) than observed in nature, and this body size was very close to that observed in freshwater populations under both natural and experimental conditions. The great phenotypic plasticity of body size at maturity in estuarine populations would have played an important role in the colonization, by this species, of inland fresh waters.

Pandalopsis spinosior new species is closely related to P. miyakei Hayashi, 1986, particularly in the rostral formula and the spine arrangement of the ambulatory legs. However, the new species is immediately distinguished from the latter by having the anteriormost spine of the dorsal rostral series (except subapical ones) situated anterior to the antennular peduncle, the pleuron of the fourth abdominal somite with a posteroventral spine and the telson armed with a greater number of dorsolateral spines.

This is the first recorded pylochelid larva. It has a mass of yolk granules and the body is covered with a thin embryonic cuticle, showing a prezoea-like appearance. The antennal exopod and mouthparts are reduced, while pereiopods, pleopods and the uropod are already well developed at the time of hatching. These features strongly suggest that the larval development of P. jeffreysii is abbreviated.

N2  - Population density and structure of the intertidal mud crab Macrophthalrnus japonicus were compared among five stations in June, August and November 1984. Population density was higher where sediment particles were finer and nitrogen content was higher than at other stations. However, large crabs were more abundant in stations with coarser sediments and lower nitrogen, indicating higher survival rate in these stations. Stations with fine sediments and higher nitrogen had higher percentage of ovigerous females in both June (early breeding season) and August (late breeding season). But in other stations, it was higher only in August. These differences indicate that high food availability may enable large reproductive effort throughout the breeding season, but also may cause high mortality under high population density. In habitats where food availability was high but crab survivorship low, early and large reproductive effort may be advantageous because probability of further reproduction may be very low.

N2  - Daily sand pellet production by the fiddler crab Uca lactea (De Haan, 1935) that lived in cages in the natural habitat was examined for five months in 1971. In 1972 and 1973 a study was done to determine the number of days per month that crabs are active. Females were less active in July and August because they were incubating broods underground. The average number of active days per year was 100.6 for males and 92.5 for females. Using their two chelipeds, females scooped 55-57% more frequently than did males, who have only one cheliped that is useful for sediment feeding. The length of dactyl and width of claw tip of the male cheliped are about 10% larger than those of the female cheliped. The total number of sand pellets produced in one year is estimated to be 34,967 in males and 38,675 in females. Pellets dry weights are 1,011 g in both males and females with the carapace width of 16.0 mm.

The whole outer face of the first maxilliped is covered with numerous arrow-headed, slender setae. On the inner side of the second maxillipeds there are two kinds of spoontipped setae; short- and long-stalked. Adjacent to these, plumose setae grow on the proximal region. There were no statistically significant sexual differences in the number of setae on the first and the second maxillipeds by the sex. Also, no differences were found in the length and width of the two maxillipeds by sex. Male and female U. lactea are equipped with mouthparts that have the same size and func tion.

N2  - Several megalopae of the plagusiid crab Plagusia dentipes were collected from Tateyama at the Pacific coast of Japan. The comparison of these specimens with previous descriptions of this stage from Japan, revealed a lack of detail in the earlier morphological accounts. Therefore, the megalopal stage of Plagusia dentipes is redescribed and once again illustrated. The new set of morphological characters for this stage is used for a detailed comparison with other known megalopae of the genus Plagusia. The results allow preliminary conclusions on phylogenetic relationships within this genus of rafting crabs.

N2  - Larval development of the sesarmine crab, Perisesarma bidens (De Haan) was studied in the laboratory at salinities 0-35‰ at 23.5-25.5℃. Larvae survived to first crab stage at salinities between 10 and 35‰. In 0 and 5‰ S larvae died within 12 h after exposure without moulting to the next stage. Total duration required for development to first crab stage was 32, 28, 25, 18, 22 and 30 days at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35‰ S, respectively. Significant differences (P<0.05) of survival rate were found among the salinities tested. The best survival was recorded between 20 and 30‰S (P<0.05), and 25‰S was found to be optimal for complete larval development of P. bidens.

N2  - Effects of temperatures (9, 13, 17, 20, 23℃) on the production of Acanthomysis mitsukurii were investigated in the laboratory under unlimited food conditions. The intermolt period increased with body length (BL) and decreased with increasing temperature. Growth factor (the percentage increase in BL between successive molts) declined with BL and the rate of the decline increased with temperature increase. Mysids reached zero growth at a smaller size under high temperatures, hence the maximum size was largest at the lowest temperature. Growth models as a discontinuous stepwise process at each experimental temperature were developed using a regression equation between the intermolt period and BL, and between the growth factor and BL, and BL on Day 0. The incubation time of young in the marsupium was significantly related to the temperature but not to the female BL. Although the number of offspring per brood (brood size) was greater at lower temperatures, incubation time was shorter at higher temperatures, resulting in a greater reproduction rate (brood size/incubation time) at the higher temperatures. There were no differences in the productivity parameters between 20℃ and 23℃ and because the survival rate of juvenile mysids to maturation was lower at 23℃ than at 20℃, the optimal temperature for population production of this species was concluded to be approximately 20℃.

N2  - Droving behaviour of the ocypodid Ilyoplax deschampsi (Rathbun, 1913) is recorded in Kyushu, western Japan. Droving crabs left their burrows and foraged near the littoral fringe at low tide, on hot summer days in July and August when their breeding season was almost finished. Male and female droving crabs were significantly larger than those remaining in the burrowing area. Droving habit is first recorded for the genus Ilyoplax.

N2  - This study focuses on the life history of the Mediterranean green crab Carcinus aestuarii along the northern shores of Tokyo Bay, Japan. Hand collection, baited traps and artificial cobble habitats were used over a period of two years at two sites, one along a canal and another in a man-made lagoon. Planktonic larvae were also surveyed. Collected crabs were analyzed for size, sex, molting condition, and ovigerous females were recorded. The results showed that the peak of megalopal settlement occurs in March. These settlers (crabs) then grow steadily throughout the summer months, and most females are able to breed during their first year. In autumn, the crabs migrate offshore, where they stay until the following spring. The breeding season lasts from November to May. Survival of larvae released late in the season, however, is lower, most likely due to increased fish predation and also to bottom hypoxia. Size analysis indicates that the crabs live at least three years, and most are able to breed three times during that period. Females, however, appear to be less likely than males to overwinter twice or more. The seasonal patterns of breeding and offshore migration observed here corresponds well with that documented for the Mediterranean green crabs in their native habitat. Since severe bottom hypoxia develops during the summer months in the offshore areas of upper Tokyo Bay, the seasonal migration pattern allows the crabs to avoid this hypoxia while utilizing wide areas of the bay during the autumn and winter months, when oxygen levels have recovered. In addition, the winter breeding habit allows most of the larvae to develop, migrate inshore and settle before predation and early bottom hypoxia become obstacles.

N2  - Intermolt (hard shelled) female Thalamita picta, including ovigerous females, were observed to mate in the field and laboratory. Postmolt (soft shelled) stages did not initiate a mating response in males. Copulation in the laboratory lasted an average of 186.1±66.7 seconds (mean±S.D., n = 16) with no significant difference (P>0.1) in duration between pairs with ovigerous and non-ovigerous females. Further, duration of copulation did not differ significantly (P>0.1) between pairs in which the male was larger than the female and those in which the female was larger than the male. For the pre-copulatory maneuvering period (time between capture of the female and the initiation of copulation), although no significant difference was observed between ovigerous and non-ovigerous females (P>0.1), pairs in which the male was smaller than the female (248.6±180.5 sec, n = 9) differed significantly (P<0.05) from pairs in which the male was larger (75.3±39.6 sec, n = 7). Mating behaviors with the congeneric species T. sima and T. prymna are compared and discussed.

N2  - Two morphological types of terminal moult male Japanese mitten crab Eriocheir japonica sampled from the sea were distinguished from the hair distribution on and relative growth of the chelae. The mating behaviour of the two morphs was observed in the laboratory. Larger males (more than 52 mm in carapace width) in small numbers had proportionally larger chelae with dense hair. Smaller males (less than 62 mm in CW) which were more numerous had relatively small chelae with thin hair. The range in size of the two morphological phases overlapped in carapace and chelar sizes, but were separated into two different growth phases from regression analysis. Both male phases are mature, have spermatophores in the vas deferens, pursue females, copulate, and fertilize eggs. Previous studies have shown that most males die without moulting after the seaward migration and reproduction, suggesting that smaller phase males die without moulting to the larger phase. Further, males of the larger phase do not participate in reproduction while they are small. The significance of the dimorphism in relation to the life history is discussed.

N2  - The intertidal distributions and habitats of three congeneric callianassid shrimps [Nihonotrypaea harmandi (Bouvier), N. japonica (Ortmann), and N. petalura (Stimpson)] were surveyed along the estuary to opensea gradient from Ariake Sound through Tachibana Bay to the East China Sea in western Kyushu, Japan. In the light of long-term-averaged salinity (psu) values hi the surface waters (at 5 m depth) in the rainy season, (N. harmandi + N. petalura) and N. japonica mainly occurred in the ranges of 34.0-30.5 (the East China Sea + Tachibana Bay + the outermost part of Ariake Sound) and 30.5-28.5 (the middle part of Ariake Sound), respectively, with their distribution boundary distinct. Using the Venice-system terms for the clas sification of brackish waters, the former species group could be designated as euhaline to mixo-euhaline species, while the latter species as a mixo-polyhaline species. From the viewpoint of the sub strate conditions and their dimensions, the habitats for the three species were basically characterized, as follows: 1) N. harmandi - the relatively small sandflats and sandy beaches of medium - fine sands, with boulder beaches, very ex posed sandy beaches, and mud flats unin habited; 2) N. petalura - small sand patches surrounded by boulders in boul der beaches; and 3) N.japonica - the ex tensive sandflats of medium - fine sands, with boulder beaches, exposed sandy beaches, and mudflats uninhabited.

N2  - Horizontal starch gel electrophoresis was used to estimate the genetic divergence among the three species of grapsid crabs under the genus Helice: H. tridens latimera, H. t. tridens and H. leachi. Eight out of 25 loci coding 15 enzymes were polymorphic: AAT-1^*, AAT2^*, GPI^*, IDHP^*, MDH-1^*, MDH-2^*, PGDH^* and LDH^*. The average proportion of polymorphic loci and heterozygosity were 0.04 and 0.006 in H. t. latimera, 0.07 and 0.005 in H. t. tridens and 0.05 and 0.004 in H. leachi, respectively. Nei's genetic distance was 0.00033 between H. t, latimera and H. t. tridens, 0.16966 between H. t. latimera and H. leachi, and 0.17017 between H. t. tridens and H. leachi. The results indicate that the degree of genetic differentiation is very small between the species of H. t. latimera and H. t. tridens and higher between H. leachi and the other two species.

N2  - Galathea amboinensis De Man, 1888 and G. inflata Potts, 1915, both known as associates of shallow water comatulid crinoids, are reported for the first time from Japan. In the Ryukyu Islands, Galathea inflata was found on 13 species of crinoids but most commonly on Comanthus parvicirrus (Miiller) and Comaster schlegelii (Carpenter). Galathea amboinensis 'was recorded from 10 crinoid species but more often on Capillaster multiradiatus (Linnaeus) than on other crinoids. Heterosexual pairs of G. inflata were found on 26.3 % of host crinoids (n=57), and all females were ovigerous. Megalopae of both galatheids were found on hosts, indicating that the larvae settled on crinoids at the megalopa stage.

N2  - Grapsid crabs Hemigrapsus sanguineus infested with Sacculina polygenea were reared in isolation for a maximum of 232 days. Size, colour and morphological features of externae were examined daily. After repeated spawning externae dropped off and new externae appeared. Of a total of 41 newly appeared externae 15 erupted more than 40 days after moulting of host crabs. Ten externae erupted within 3 days after the moult. The externae released nauplii with an average interval of 17.0 ± 2.6 days. Moulting of the inner cuticle of the mantle cavity of the externa occurred 6.2 ± 4.0 days after the release of nauplii. The behaviour of parasitized H. sanguineus at the time of nauplii release was observed. The crabs climbed up on a stone placed in an aquarium and raised their bodies supported by walking legs and chelipeds. The fourth legs were always extended backward. Low frequency pumping movements of the abdomen contributed little to larval release. The nauplii were mainly expelled from the aperture by the contraction and expansion of the externa.

N2  - The grapsid crab Cyclograpsus intermedius Ortmann, 1894 in the Amakusa Islands, Japan, is parasitized by two sacculinid parasites: Sacculina oblonga Liitzen & Yamaguchi, 1999 and Sacculina confragosa Boschma, 1933. Average prevalences at four sites are 1.6 to 12.1 % in S. oblonga and 0.4 to 1.5 % in S. confragosa. The number of externae attached to crabs infected with S. oblonga is only one without exception. Most of the crabs parasitized by S. confragosa had one externa but a few crabs had two or three externae attached. A significant difference in infection rate between the sexes was found in S. oblonga. Female crabs seem to be more commonly infected by the parasite. The morphological modification is more significant in smaller males than in larger crabs.

N2  - A survey of the spatial distribution pattern of the gnathiid isopod, Elaphognathia cornigera (Nunomura, 1992), inhabiting the sponge Halichondria okadai (Kadota), was conducted on a rocky intertidal shore on the Izu Peninsula, southern Japan. While the number of adult male Elaphognathia cornigera is related to sponge size, larvae tended to aggregate in smaller sponges. The vertical distribution of the isopod overlapped with that of the sponge. No particular patterns were observed in the distribution of E. cornigera adults, but larvae mainly occurred around mean tide level. This may be explained by the behavior of larvae migrating between sponges and host fishes.

N2  - Predation on released seedlings of the Japanese mitten crab, Eriocheirjaponica, by fishes was examined in the upper reach of the Koya River and middle reach of the Nishiki River. Stomach contents of fishes sampled before and after the release in the upper and middle reaches, were analysed. Mortality of crabs caused by fish predation was high in the upper reach, but lower in the middle reach. This difference is suggested to be largely due to differences in the diversity of potential prey species for the fishes at the two study sites. In the upper reach with a low diversity of prey species, the released juveniles had high a prey value to fishes and subsequently, fishes fed heavily on them.

N2  - Three additional hermit crabs belonging to the genus Calcinus are described from French Polynesia: Calcinus anani n. sp., from Tuamotu and Marquesas sublittoral waters (18/55-140 m); C. hakahau n. sp., from the Marquesas (18-55 m); and C. revi, a dwarf species from the Tuamotu. Coloration, one of the most important diagnostic characters for species of this genus, is illustrated for each species. The diagnosis of Calcinus gouti Poupin, 1997, previously known from a single specimen, has been amplified by observations made from a second specimen found in the collections of the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris. A key to the thirty Indo-West Pacific Calcinus species is presented.

N2  - Polyester resin casts of burrows of the thalassinidean shrimps, Callianassajaponica Ortmann, 1891 and Callianassa sp. (= C. japonica: de Man, 1928), were collected on intertidal sandflats hi western Kyushu, Japan. The difference in basic architecture of the burrows of these two species was obvious: the burrow of C. japonica had alternating shafts and chambers, with a single surface opening, while that of Callianassa sp. was basically Y-shaped, with two surface openings. The average dimensions of individual components of the burrows are given for each species and possible functions of these components, especially with regard to the shrimps' trophic modes, are discussed.

N2  - The larvae of Rhynchocinetes conspiciocellus Okuno & Takeda, 1992, pass through eleven zoeal stages and one megalopal stage before metamorphosing into the juveniles under laboratory conditions. The morphological characters of the larval and juvenile stages are described with illustrations and compared with those of Cinetorhynchus rigens (Gordon). The egg of R. conspiciocellus is small with the pre-eyed egg size of 0.45×0.56 mm (volume 0.062 mm^3), and the number of eggs of each ovigerous female varies from 185 to 5075 (mean 977). As the zoeae have a long planktonic larval period, the geographical distribution range of the adults may be broader than the known range in the Indo-Pacific region.

N2  - Salinity tolerance of hard stage Pinnotheres bidentatus, was studied during November and December of 1996. The pea crabs were collected from tidal waters at Kaomei tidal flat during night-time flood tides during full or new moons using 1-mm mesh plankton nets. Survival of these pea crabs under a wide range of salinity (0 to 30 ‰ salinity with intervals of 5 ‰ salinity and 0 to 5 ‰ salinity with intervals of 1 ‰ salinity) was examined. Only 0 ‰ salinity treatments had 100% mortality rates, whereas no mortality occurred in the rest of salinity treatments. These results indicate that hard stage P. bidentatus may be tolerant to a wide range of salinities, but it cannot survive if suddenly exposed to freshwater. Sudden exposure to 0 ‰ salinity may be seen in some parts of the tidal flat area during seasons of abundant freshwater influx and human fishery activities. However, active swimming behavior of the hard stage pea crabs observed in 0 ‰ salinity treatment suggests that these free-swimming pea crabs may be able to avoid unfavorable salinity conditions by moving out of the area.

N2  - Larvae of the thalassinidean shrimp, Callianassa japonica Ortmann, 1891, were reared through their entire development in the laboratory, starting from zoea 1 released by females collected on an intertidal sandflat of Ariake Sound in western Kyushu, Japan, in the middle of June, 1997. The larval development consisted of five zoeal stages and a decapodid stage. Minimum durations of the zoeal stages 1-4 and the zoeal stage 5 were 3 days and 4 days, respectively, at water temperatures of 22.0-24.7℃ and salinities of 33.2-33.8. Morphology of each stage was described in comparison with that of another Japanese callianassid, C. petalura. The two species can be distinguished at the zoeal stage 1 and the decapodid stage, based on the presence (C.japonica) or absence (C. petalura) of a coxal seta on maxilliped 2 (in zoea 1) and on the smaller number of segments of the antennal flagella in C. japonica (in decapodid: 20-21 vs. 24-25).

N2  - The morphological features of laboratory-reared larvae of Asthenognathus inaequipes and Tritodynamia rathbunae (family Pinnotheridae) are described and compared to related species. A. inaequipes and T. rathbunae both have five zoea and one megalopa stages. Diagnostic characters relating to distinct setal patterns between the two species are given. For specimens reared in 1989, the second zoea of T. rathbunae had irregular features on the antennae and telson in comparison with the other zoeal stages. However, these features were absent when the zoeae were reared once again in 1996 to confirm this phenomenon. The appendages of the irregular second zoea closely resembled those of the zoea of the family Goneplacidae.

N2  - Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the chemosensation and feeding behavior of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus). Five extracts of squid, herring, mussel, king crab muscle, and king crab ovary were used as test solutions. Change in antennular flicking rate was employed as an index of detecting chemicals. The median effective concentration at which 50% of crabs detected the solution varied between 10^<-4> to 10^<-6> g l^<-1> for the five extracts. Crabs were most sensitive to conspecific muscle, but least to mussel. Movement of maxillipeds, probing of chelipeds, movement of walking legs, and body elevation indicated the onset of feeding behavior. Among these indicators, movement of maxillipeds was the most sensitive. The median effective concentration at which 50% of crabs showed feeding responses ranged from 10^<-2> for ovary to 10^<-3> g l^<-1> for herring extract. Herring was the most effective natural bait for red king crabs, while little difference was detected between the sexes for chemosensation.

N2  - A new rhynchocinetid shrimp, Cinetorhynchus fasciatus, is described and illustrated from three male specimens collected from Chichi-jima Island of the Ogasawara Islands, Japan, and Oahu of the Hawaiian Islands. The new species closely resembles C. hiatti (Holthuis & Hayashi) and C. rigens (Gordon) in the armature of the ambulatory pereiopods, carpi and dactyli in particular, but may be distinguished by the combination of the fourth abdominal somite rounded on the posteroventral angle, the stylocerite not extending beyond the end of the antennular distal segment, the meri of the third and fourth pereiopods bearing two to four spines on the lateral surface, the second maxilliped bearing a developed podobranch, and the distinctive coloration. A modified key to species of the genus is proposed.

N2  - A laboratory experiment compared feeding rate, foraging response, and survival between unfed and fed ovigerous and nonovigerous Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister) over a six month winter period from December 1994 through May 1995. Twenty-four female crabs were collected from Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay, southeastern Alaska, and separated into 2 treatments, each containing 6 ovigerous and 6 nonovigerous crabs. The treatments were in separate flow-through seawater tanks containing sediment. One treatment was fed a diet of squid while the other was not fed. Feeding rates and foraging responses were measured over a 24 hr period every 2 weeks. Ovigerous females had significantly lower feeding rates (9.0 ± 1.5 g・d^<-1>) than nonovigerous females (16.8 ± 0.4 g・d^<-1>) in the laboratory (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.001). The foraging responses of ovigerous crabs were significantly lower in comparison to nonovigerous females (Chi-squared test, P < 0.01). No mortality occurred in any treatment over the six month experiment, demonstrating that Dungeness crabs can survive over the winter without feeding in laboratory conditions.

N2  - Waving displays of the intertidal ocypodid crab Scopimera globosa were observed in the field in relation to other behaviors. Most of the crabs observed to wave were males holding burrows. The proportion of waving crabs was higher in the summer months when ovigerous females and precopulatory behavior (males chasing females) occurred. A negative correlation between waving and precopulatory behavior was found i.e., males performing waving intensively exhibited less frequent precopulatory behavior. However in more than half of the precopulatory behaviors, waving occurred both immediately before and after precopulatory behavior. No correlation was found between the waving frequency and either the frequency of aggressive encounters or the density of neighboring crabs. Immediately before and after an aggressive encounter, the case when waving occurred was observed at a similar frequency to the case when no-waving occurred. These observations suggest that waving in S. globosa functions as a courtship behavior advertising burrowholding males.

N2  - The reproductive behavior of the spiny king crab, Paralithodes brevipes, was observed in the laboratory. Females always molted before mating and extruding eggs. Males performed pre-copulatory guarding behavior before and/or after its mate molted. When males guarded females, prior to the female molting, the average duration from the start of guarding to molting was 38.6 ± 24.9SD hours. Females spawned within 24 hours of molting. Competition among males for females was observed, and larger males appeared to have a competitive advantage although copulation occurred even when males were smaller than their mates.

N2  - Intermolt (hard shelled) female Thalamita prymna, including ovigerous females, were observed to mate both in the field (N=2) and laboratory (N=13). In the laboratory, intermolt males and females showed characteristic stalking and maneuvering behaviors prior to copulation, with copulation lasting 34.5±2.4 minutes (mean±SD). During a 20 month field survey, no guarding behavior or sperm plugs which are characteristic of portunid soft-female mating behavior were observed. A female reared in isolation to maturity over a 6 month period from an immature instar successfully mated during the intermolt stage and produced a fertile egg brood ten days after the single mating. From these observations, hard-female mating is concluded to be the principal mating strategy in T. prymna. Females of the congeneric species T. sima also mate during the intermolt and the contrasting mating behaviors of these 2 species are discussed.

N2  - The temporal and spatial distribution of larvae and newly settled juveniles of a stomatopod crustacean Oratosquilla oratorio, (De Haan, 1844) was investigated in the eastern part of the Sea of Hiuchi-Nada, Japan. Occurrence of many larvae to the northwest of Ibuki-jima Island suggests it may be the spawning ground. Larvae are transported counterclockwise around Ibuki-jima Island by a residual current, widely settle in the bottom waters, and metamorphose to benthic juveniles. Newly settled individuals were sampled at most stations in August, but were absent in the southern waters of Ibuki-jima Island in October. Oxygen-deficient waters from August to October may be partially responsible for the distribution of O. oratorio, juveniles in October.

N2  - A dense population of the cirolanid isopod, Eurydice nipponica Bruce & Jones, inhabited an intertidal sand flat in western Kyushu, Japan. Newly-ovigerous female groups occurred twice yearly, during March to June and August to October, generating two major recruitment groups: June to July (summer group) and September to November (autumn group). The summer group became ovigerous after 2 mo, with most of the early recruits to the group dying out after breeding (3-5-mo life span). Some of the later summer recruits overwintered to have their second brood, dying out during spring to summer. Members of the autumn group overwintered to have their first brood during late spring to mid-summer, some of them surviving longer to have their second brood just before dying (12-13-mo life span). The life history pattern for males was not as clear as for females owing to the successive merging of the newly-recruited individuals into the older ones with smaller asymptote body sizes. The center of distribution of the population along the elevation gradient on the sand flat was generally located around the MLWS level, with the breeding components mostly concentrated there. Most probably part of the overwintering population migrates to the subtidal zone to avoid the harsh conditions of the winter months.

N2  - A new species of rhizocephalan, Sacculina polygenea, is described and illustrated on basis of material from the Amakusa Islands, Kyushu, Japan. Although previously recorded as a locally common parasite of the littoral crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus (de Haan, 1835), it has remained undescribed. The species is compared with S. senta Boschma, 1933 and S. nigra Shiino, 1943, which parasitize the same crab. Up to 5 concentric cuticular rings surround the stalk and adjacent part of the body. Such rings have never before been observed in any species of the genus and are probably evidence that S. polygenea moults its outer cuticle up to 5 times.

N2  - The population structure, relative growth and reproduction of the fiddler crab, Uca arcuata (De Haan) were studied at Ohno River, Central Kyushu, Japan. The minimum size of ovigerous crabs was 19.4 mm CW. The largest size was 36.8 mm CW in males and 33.6 mm CW in females. Three and a half year rearing was conducted in the laboratory. Newly settled crabs grow to 19 mm CW by the end of next year, but females deposit eggs in the following year. The crabs reared in the laboratory grew to a maximum size of 32.5 mm CW in males and 29.3 mm CW in females. The size distribution and the results of rearing suggest that U. arcuata survives more than five years. Males were predominant in number; sex ratio was 1.36:1.00. Ovigerous females appeared from the last third of May to the last third of August. It is likely that females deposit eggs two or more times during the reproductive period. The relationship between egg number (Y) and crab size (X) is: Y=5721.4X-93702. Ovigerous females feed on the surface. There is an inverse relationship between the gonad and hepatopancreas indices suggesting that substances are shifted from the hepatopancreas to the ovary. The percentage of the large cheliped to total body weight increased with the crab size, reaching 40%.

N2  - The morphological modifications caused by Sacculina polygenea in the grapsid crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus were examined. Parasitized males carrying externa were divided into seven stages of feminization by the degree of reduction of the first and second pleopods and the appearance of biramous pleopods on the third to fifth abdominal segments. All males examined retained first pleopods and most of them were Stage I or II. The development of femaletype biramous pleopods rarely occurs. Only 10.1% crabs were in advanced stages of feminization. Enlargement of the abdomen and reduction of chela height in parasitized males were pro nounced in small males and less so in larger males. Modification caused by the rhizocephalan parasite likely proceeds from when the host is young and small.

N2  - Predator-prey interactions between the portunid crab, Scylla serrata, and the grapsid crab, Hemigrapsus penicillatus, were investigated under laboratory conditions. Three trophic relationships were found: firstly, S. serrata preyed on H. penicillatus, secondly, H. penicillatus preyed on S. serrata, and thirdly that no trophic interactions occurred. Variation in the outcome of these interactions can be explained by crab size (including cheliped size) and size selective behaviour of the two species.

N2  - Manipulation of the host's behavior by the rhizocephalan parasite, Sacculina polygenea, was observed in an aquarium with a video camera. The brachyuran host, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, cleaned the surface of the parasite's externa with its chelipeds. When the parasite released nauplii, the host assisted the parasite by adopting the stereotypic larval release behavior of female crabs. While releasing the nauplii, the host remained stationary on a rock, occasionally flexing its abdomen with a waving action. After releasing nauplii several times, the externa became smaller and withered, and the host removed it with its chelipeds and ate it. This behavior was displayed by both sexes of the host.

N2  - Field trials were conducted to examine the feasibility of guiding juvenile freshwater shrimps to fishways using lights at nighttime during the summer. The number of migrating shrimps was counted after different numbers and arrangements of underwater electric torches (wavelength 400-700 nm, narrow focus) were illuminated in the rivers. An underwater beam (2400-15000 lx) placed on the bottom and directed diagonally upstream across the river induced shrimps (e.g., Caridina japonica, C. leucosticta, C. typus, and Macrobrachium formosense) that were migrating along one bank to move across to the other side.

N2  - Relative growth of the chelae of the Japanese mitten crab Eriocheir japonica during the juvenile stages was investigated by laboratory rearing. Regression of chela propodus height (CPH) on carapace width (CW) suggested that two growth phases are present in juveniles (CW<40 mm) of both sexes. These two phases are separated by an inflection at approximately 11 mm CW in both sexes. Between the first and second phases, there are significant differences in the slope and Y-intercept of the regression lines for each sex. Significant differences between sexes were not detected for the first phase, but were detected for the second phase. With the addition of data for sub-adult and adult stages a complete growth pattern of E. japonica chela could be estimated. In addition to the first phase three other phases in the males and two phases in females were observed.

Comparison of the type material of the two nominal taxa indicates that there are no significant differences between them and N. miyamotoi is a junior subjective synonym of N. japonensis. This reduces the number of species of Natatolana recorded from Japan to two, N. japonensis and N. albicaudata (Stebbing, 1900).

N2  - The intertidal ocypodid crab Ilyoplax pusilla builds a mound at the burrow entrance, by piling mud excavated from the burrow or gathered from the nearby surface. Mounds located separate from the burrow entrance were built predominantly by hard carapace males, while mounds adjoining or enclosing burrow entrances were mainly built by ovigerous females and heterosexual pairs. During heavy rain, when surface activity was lowered, the proportion of burrows with a separate mound decreased whereas that of burrows with a mound adjoining the burrow entrance increased. Females with a mound adjoining the burrow entrance showed shorter surface activity, compared with females without a mound. Between males with a separate mound and males without a mound, the duration of surface activity was not different.

N2  - The occurrence of the sandy beach mysids Archaeomysis spp. (Mysidacea) with epibiontic peritrich ciliates (Protozoa) has been studied. Epibiontic peritrich infestations were found on four Archaeomysis species collected from the western North Pacific. This study provided the evidence of existence of a previously undescribed symbiontic association between mysids and epibiontic ciliates. Overall incidence of infestation for Archaeomysis sp., A. kokuboi, A. vulgaris, and A. japonica hosting peritrichs averaged 74.7, 75.6, 22.3, and 1.2%, respectively, with higher incidence in the northern populations for the genus. No mysids carrying peritrichs were found in specimens taken from central to southwestern Japan. Thus, the attached ciliates were considered to have a cold water affinity. Seasonal observations over one year suggested that the mysid-ciliate association in the northern waters of Japan was a year-round phenomenon. The incidence of infested mysids in the harsh zone of sandy beaches was noticeably higher than that in the infralittoral bottoms, suggesting that the habitat of host mysids may be a factor affecting the infestation success of the peritrichs.

N2  - Foregut contents of Eurynolambrus australis from the intertidal zone at Kaikoura, New Zealand, showed that a coralline alga (Corallina officinalis) was the most important dietary component, occurring in 94.6% of the crabs examined (constituting 55.0% of diet). Isopods, amphipods, decapods, as well as red, green and brown algae were also common components of the diet. There were no differences in diet between male and female crabs, or crabs collected from different sites. Ontogenetic differences in diet were observed, with larger crabs consuming more decapods, gastropods, coralline and brown algae, while small and medium-sized crabs consumed more amphipods. Much of the animal component of the diet can be attributed to specialist grazing on a coralline alga which may also be a source of pigments helping to camouflage the crab.

N2  - Population structures and reproductive activities of two intertidal ocypodid crabs, Ilyoplax pingi and I. dentimerosa, were compared at Kanghwa Island, western Korea. Density at abundantly populated area was higher in I. pingi (mean = 238 per m^2) than in I. dentimerosa (159 per m^2). Ovigerous females of I. pingi occurred from May to August, with the peak in August, resembling other temperate ocypodids, whereas females of I. dentimerosa brooded from April to August, with the marked peak in April. Females of both species appear to commence breeding at age of 1 year. Female I. dentimerosa carried eggs of larger size (mean = 0.3753 mm × 0.3543 mm) and smaller number (mean = 1136 eggs) than female I. pingi (0.2869 mm × 0.2725 mm, 2192 eggs). Pair formation of both species was completed by entry of the male and the female into the same burrow; in I. pingi the female usually entered the male's burrow, while the reverse case occurred more often in I. dentimerosa.

The new species is compared with P. samuelis (Stimpson, 1857), P. hirsutiusculus (Dana, 1851) and P. venturensis Coffin, 1957, from the west coast of North America, and P. filholi De Man, 1887, from Asian waters. It is suggested that Stimpson's (1858) Eupagurus hirsutiusculus from Hakodate Bay might acutually be this new species. The new species is one of the most common intertidal hermit crabs in Hakodate Bay.

N2  - An ultrastructural investigation of the porcellanid crabs, Aliaporcellana suluensis and Pisidia longicornis reveals that they possess small, spherical to ovoid, pedunculate spermatophores containing a few extremely elongate spermatozoa wound spirally inside the ampulla. In each species the ampulla is divided into two halves which join at a structurally complex, thickened lateral ridge. The spermatozoa of both species have small complex acrosomal vesicles with a perforate operculum and complex, concentric acrosome zonation. Several of these internal acrosome zones are autapomorphic characters for the spermatozoa of the Porcellanidae, when compared with previously studied anomuran spermatozoa. The elongate spermatozoa have a long tail-region composed of a central core of microtubules (autapomorphy) which has a collar of cytoplasm proximally and distally a nuclear sleeve. This central microtubular core splits distally to produce more than four external microtubular arms. The elongate, almost "flagellate", appearance of the spermatozoa of Aliaporcellana and Pisidia is unique for the investigated Decapoda.

N2  - The distribution and reproductive biology of the hermit crab Pagurus nigrofascia Komai, 1996, were studied from March 1992 to May 1995 at Kattoshi, Hakodate Bay, northern Japan. The species was distributed in the upper intertidal zone, mainly at pebble-covered areas on the shoreline. Ovigerous females were observed from April to February. Developmental stages of incubated eggs were synchronized within the population. The appearance of ovigerous females and examination of developmental stages of eggs revealed that the main spawning month was May, females oviposited once a year, and eggs were incubated for about nine months through the hot summer and cold winter. This long incubation period is a striking reproductive characteristic compared with other Pagurus spp., and suggests a wide variety of reproductive features may exist within the same genus Pagurus, even among species living in the same habitat.

The degree of preservation of abdominal chromatophores were periodically observed until 120 days after initial preservation. Differences between temperature regimes were more marked than between preservatives, with 1% formalin at 2℃ being the most effective preservative to minimize pigment loss. Significant differences in the vulnerability of color fading were noted between different chromatophores on the abdomen.

N2  - The larval development of Helice leachi Hess, 1865, consists of five zoeal stages and one megalopal stage. The morphology of all larval stages and the first crab stage is described and illustrated. The morphological characters of the larvae of H. leachi are compared with those of H. japonica and H. tridens. The zoeae of H. leachi are unique among the species of Helice in lacking a lateral carapace spine.

N2  - A predominantly vertical reef face adjacent to the Banda Marine Laboratory of Tokyo University of Fisheries, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, was regularly surveyed for pueruli and juvenile Panulirusjaponicus (Von Siebold) over a 21 month period. The height above the sea bed and the incline of the reef face at which pueruli and juvenile lobsters occurred in holes during the daytime were recorded. The rock face (53.2m^2) ranged in height from 0.9-1.4m above the sea bed, however &ap; 85% was between 1.0-1.1m. Pueruli (postlarvae) and first instar juveniles were distributed non-randomly on the rock face, with near horizontal sections of the reef and areas immediately adjacent to the sand sediment being less favored than more vertical sections of the reef. Small juveniles [8-20mm carapace length (CL)] generally showed similar shelter preferences as pueruli and first instar juveniles. Larger juveniles (20-40mm CL), however, showed a reduced shelter preference in relation to both height above the sea bed and the angle of rock face incline and this appears to be related to limitations in the availability of holes for this size group on the reef face. Most pueruli and first instar juveniles were observed in an inverted (ventral side up) position (91.5%) in holes, this percentage decreased markedly as lobsters grew.

N2  - Previously, the species Tritodynamia intermedia has been distinguished from T. horvathi based on the number of teeth on the dactylus of the cheliped. However, it was reviewed that T. intermedia is synonymous with T. horvathi. The number of teeth on the chelipeds of T. horvathi with growth was investigated in the laboratory and the field. Crabs from the first to the third stages had two teeth on the proximal section of the dactylus of the cheliped whilst the fifth or later stage crabs had only one tooth at the same site on the cheliped. Both types of chelipeds were observed in the fourth stage crabs. In the natural population, carapace width of crabs with 2 teeth chelipeds were less than 12.3 mm, and that with one tooth chelipeds larger than 5.4 mm. Furthermore, sexual differences in the width of the abdomen occurred at the fourth crab stage.

N2  - Characteristic outgrowths developed from wounded surfaces on the lateral faces of chelipeds of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. These outgrowths formed as separated projections, fused at the base but branched at the distal end, or projections that were completely fused (without hooks or serrations). Outgrowths were usually a paired projection, with the individual projections developing from the proximal and distal surfaces of the wound, respectively, as mirror images. The two projections fused if the distance between them was small. The variations in the shapes of the outgrowths were due to differences in the frequency of fusion.

N2  - Temporal size variation of precopulatory guarding males and females of the hermit crab Pagurus middendorffii were described from field data collected during a single breeding season, and the advantage of large size to males competing for mates was examined in a laboratory experiment. Larger males won in mate competition, and size assortative mating occurred in the peak and the late periods of the breeding season, but not in the early period. Both mating male and female sizes declined with time during the breeding period. The decrease in size of mating males with time might be caused by the trade-off between the present and future reproductive success, or by physiological constraints. Decreasing size of breeding females might be due to size-dependent variation in the allocation of reproduction and growth, or to physiological constraints experienced by small females.

N2  - Reproductive cycle, mating behavior and early growth of the stone crab Hapalogaster dentata were studied from September 1989 to November 1994 at Kattoshi, Hakodate Bay, Japan. Histological examination and appearance of ovigerous females revealed that the spawning season is from October to November, females oviposit once a year, and eggs are incubated for about 110 days. Size at female sexual maturity is 8 mm carapace length when they are two or more years old. During the mating season, a male guards a ripe female just prior to oviposition by grasping her or covering her with his body. Although such guarding behavior is commonly observed for the Lithodinae, this is the first description for Hapalogastrinae which belongs to the same family, Lithodidae. The guarded female undergoes molting, and immediate spawning after copulation, during the two or three days of guarding, which suggests that mate guarding might deprive other competitive males of access to ripe females. Although H. dentata shows some differences to lithodine crabs, such as smaller body size, fewer eggs, and no seasonal or size dependent migration, these reproductive behaviors strongly resemble those of the Lithodinae, which suggests the behavioral relatedness of both subfamilies.

N2  - Hermit crabs occupying gastropod shells that contained some remnants of the soft parts of the snail were found in the gill net collections obtained from a sandy sea bed off Kuroi, Niigata Prefecture. They were 3 individuals of Diogenes spinifrons and 1 individual of D. edivardsii. Scrapes left on the operculum of a snail indicated that it was attacked by the crab when it was alive. Tank observations suggested that the crabs consumed the remnants as food. A possibility of dual functions of such shells as a new resident and food source is discussed.

N2  - Reproductive biology of the hermit crab Pagurus middendorffii was studied from August 1992 to January 1994 in Kattoshi, located along the west side of Hakodate Bay, Hokkaido, Japan. Its mating season was from late October to early December with a peak in early November. Ovigerous females were observed from October to March, with highest frequencies occurring from December to February (mean: 91.3%). Developmental stages of incubated eggs were synchronized within the population. Females were found to be able to reproduce in their first year and laying a single clutch each following year. Incubation period was about 3.5 months. While ovigerous females did not molt from November to March, male molting frequency was also low during the female incubation period. The covariation of male and female molt frequencies suggests that females do not necessarily have a growth disadvantage due to molt cessation during incubation.

The statistical analysis of three species, Thalamita sima, Charybdis (Gonioneptunus) bimaculata and Charybdis (Charybdis) japonica showed no distinct increase in the percentage of left-handed crabs in relation to size. This indicates that left-handed crabs develop their handedness innately. In Portunus (Monomia) argentatus a significant increase in the percentage of left-handed individuals in relation to size was confirmed. In this species left-handedness has probably arisen following the loss of the righthanded crusher.

N2  - Six crab species inhabit the rocky intertidal of the South Island of New Zealand: Petrolisthes elongatus, Heterozius rotundifrons, Hemigrapsus edwardsi, H. crenulatus, Cyclograpsus lavauxi and Helice crassa. The grapsid C. lavauxi is the most abundant and ubiquitous species: its intertidal distribution was uniform between sites - the lower limit (within approximately 5 cm of MSL) and the upper limit (150 cm above MSL) being determined by the availability of suitable rocky substrate or aerial exposure. Highest densities were on sheltered rocky beaches on the open coast line. Another grapsid H. edwardsi, the major potential competitor, overlapped with C. lavauxi between 0 and 100 cm above MSL. Gut content analysis suggested that both species feed almost exclusively on the same brown algae. Tide tank experiments suggested that the zonation of both species is primarily associated with tidal exposure times. At field sites where H. edwardsi was absent, the lower limit of C. lavauxi was unchanged. Our results support the hypothesis that interspecific interactions are of little, if any, importance in determining intertidal distribution of these grapsid crabs.

N2  - The first zoea of a deepwater crab, Paromola macrochira Sakai, is described based on laboratory-reared material. Larval characters of described zoeas of the family Homolidae are compared and discussed together with those of the other archaeobrachyuran families. Within the genus Paromola, the zoea of P. macrochira much resembles that of P. cuvieri (Risso), but differs from that of P. japonica Parisi mainly in maxilla and carapace ornamentation. Homolid and dromiid zoeas have many anomuran features in common, and two types are recognized among them. The zoeas of the Raninidae show a number of larval characters of the higher brachyurans. The zoeas of the Latreillidae also closely resemble those of the Homolidae, but can be distinguished by the setation of the endopod of maxilliped 2. It is suggested that homolid and latreillid zoeas seem to show an intermediate level of evolutionary processes between morphologically advanced raninids and more primitive dromiids.

N2  - Shell availability and shell utilization patterns of the hermit crab Pagurus filholi (de Man) were studied on a rocky shore at Kattoshi, Hakodate Bay, Japan. Quantitative sampling revealed that the proportion of Reticunassa and Littorina shells used by hermit crabs was significantly higher than the relative abundance of these gastropods. Since shell-species preference tests revealed that P. filholi preferred Reticunassa shells, it is suggested that shell-species preference is one of the factors that influence shell utilization. Shell adequacy index (SAI) decreased with increasing crab size for each shell type, and hermit crabs used relatively suitable shells (SAI=1) when shell availability was high. Larger crabs used smaller than preferred shell sizes (SAI<1) and smaller crabs used larger than preferred shell sizes (SAI>1) with decreasing shell abundance. Shell species used by the hermit crab changed with increasing crab size. Therefore, it is suggested that hermit crabs obtain relatively suitable shells by changing shell species.

Male endopodites, which develop later into male copulatory organs as one of secondary sexual characters, started to elongate at the fifth stage. The androgenic glands were observed morphologically at the sixth stage. This study suggests that the gonadal primordia start to differentiate into testes in the absence of visible androgenic glands in male A. vulgare. The developmental process of male internal and external sexual characters in malacostracan Crustacea were discussed.

N2  - The population structure, growth, migration and participation in reproduction of the Japanese mitten crab Eriocheir japonicus was studied, based on the size and density distribution and variation in sex ratio along the Kaminokawa River, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Crabs were collected using crab baskets between September, 1985 and August, 1986. In the freshwater area, the proportion of large crabs (55 mm≦ CW) increased while the number of crabs per basket (CPUE values) decreased with distance upstream, and the sex ratio also became female-biased with distance upstream. Over one year, the sex ratio among the large crabs was female-biased; among the small crabs it was male-biased. In the brackish-water area, the sex ratio was male-biased, but during the breeding season, a female-bias among large crabs and a male-bias among small crabs was noted. Consequently, we suggest that female crabs migrate upstream in larger numbers than male crabs. During the breeding season, the crabs which participate in reproduction consist of female-biased large crabs migrating downstream from the upper regions as well as male-biased small crabs migrating from the lower regions of the river.

N2  - To determine the effectiveness of possessing toxins as a defense mechanism in crabs, the level of limb loss was examined in a poisonous crab Atergatis floridus. Crabs were collected individually using SCUBA between June 1990 and December 1992. The sex ratio approximated 1:1. Significant levels of limb loss were observed in both males and females, but limb loss frequency differed between sexes. Higher frequencies of limb loss were found in males (41.3% with limb loss) than females (18.4%). Site of loss also differed between sexes, with males having a higher loss of the walking legs 1, 3 and 4 than the chelipeds and leg 2 (P<0.01). Females have a more random pattern of limb loss. In conclusion, A. floridus was found to have a similar degree of limb loss to other reported crab studies. In situ observations of the behaviour of A floridus and predator interactions suggest the ecological benefit from the possession of toxins as a primary anti-predation strategy may be less effective than initially suspected.

N2  - A cladistic analysis was performed to determine genealogical relationships among subgenera of the shrimp genus Penaeus and for species in the American subgenera Farfantepenaeus and Litopenaeus. Using a combination of genital and somatic characters, Penaeus subgenera were found to exhibit the following pattern of relationships: [Litopenaeus [Fenneropenaeus [Penaeus s.s. [Melicertus - Farfantepenaeus - Marsupenaeus ]]]]. Four genital synapomorphies divide Farfantepenaeus into 2 species groups: a P. (F.) brasiliensis complex consisting of P. (F.) brasiliensis, P. (F.) californiensis, P. (F. ) duorarum, and P. (F.) notialis and a P. (F.) aztecus complex comprised of P. (F.) aztecus, P. (F.) brevirostris, P. (F.) paulensis, and P. (F.) subtHis. Additional characters permitted a phylogenetic hypothesis to be developed for Farfantepenaeus taxa. Fortytwo genital character states revealed the species in the subgenus Litopenaeus to have the following relationships: [P. (L.) vannamei [P. (L.) occidentalis [P. (L.) stylirostris [P. (L.) schmitti - P. (L.) setiferus]]]]. Evolutionary patterns in the genus are discussed.

It took 12-17 days under laboratory conditions from hatching to end of the second zoeal stage. Petrolisthesjaponicus is morphologically distinguishable through the zoeal stages from the other three species by the maxillule, the endopod of the first maxilliped and the telson. The first zoea of P. japonicus in the present study differs from those in previous studies in the numbers of antennular aesthetascs and spines on the basis of the maxillule. The genus Petrolisthes is divided into six groups based on six morphological characters in the first and second zoeae, representing the heterogeneity of the genus in the adult morphology.

Morphological characters of the first and second zoeae are described and illustrated, and compared with those of other known zoeae of the Camptandriinae and Macrophthalminae. The zoeae of the camptandriinid species can be distinguished from those of the macrophthalminids by setal formulae of maxillular and maxillar endopods. This finding is in good agreement with the classification of adult crabs by Manning & Holthuis (1981). Keys to the zoeae of the camptandriinid species and the ocypodid sub families are given.

The casts showed the following common structural features: a U-shaped tunnel with two openings; the burrow crosssection was semi-circular and the floor was flat and smooth; and a constriction was present on the central part of the burrow. The density of individual O. oratoria in the bay, each occupying a burrow, was estimated at 0.285 inds./m^2, from the number of burrow openings on the bottom.

N2  - The mating behavior of the grapsid crab Gaetice depressus was investigated with reference to the relative body size of males and females of the mating pairs. In laboratory tanks, sexually active males and receptive females were held together and their behaviors recorded with a video camera. When males were larger than females in the pairs, mating usually began with female approach to the male, and they continued to make contact with each other after copulation. In contrast, when males were smaller than females, mating usually began with male approach to the female, and they parted shortly after copulation. The straddling of females by males before copulation and the female-over-male copulatory position were observed regardless of the relative body size of the pairs. The difference in the female's behavior between the matings with larger and smaller males suggests that females prefer males larger than themselves.

N2  - Lateral outgrowths were induced by damage to the propodi of the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. On some of the damaged propodi, a slightly projecting structure was formed at the site of the wound at the first molt after wounding. Such structures became larger at the next molt. Some of them were single and others were bifurcated structures. These structures formed a hook at each of the points on the branched structure, similar to that at the tip of a normal propodus.

N2  - The prevalence of Sacculina sp. in Hemigrapsus sanguineus was examined on specimens collected at 13 sites in the Amakusa Islands and surrounding areas. The highest and lowest prevalences were 84.1 and 1.1 % in males and 83.6 and 1.0 % in females respectively. The statistical analysis of the frequency of parasites per host specimen indicates that the settlement of the parasite in the host is contagious.

N2  - A new nephropid lobster, Nephropsis hamadai, is described from a bathyal depth in Sagami Nada, central Japan. The new species is readily distinguished from N. stewarti Wood-Mason, 1873 by the combination of stout and less pubescent body, and spinose dorsal rostral carinae. It is also distinguished from the closest species, N. serrata Macpherson, 1993, from northern Australia by the shapes of coxal processes of both the second and third pereopods.

N2  - The growth and reproduction of Rhynchoplax coralicola were investigated from March 1993 to April 1994 at the Banda Marine Laboratory of Tokyo University of Fisheries, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Ovigerous females were found from June to September with a peak in July-August. After the puberty molt, secondary sexual characteristics appear in the abdomen of females and in the chelae of males. The clutch size of ovigerous females ranged from 23 to 220 eggs with a significant increase in diameter of eyed eggs over non-eyed eggs. Juveniles recruit from September, growing slowly over winter and spring but from March to June they grow rapidly, maturing during May to July. After the reproductive period few adults were observed. It is suggest that the maximum life span of R. coralicola must be about one year in this study area.

N2  - A new genus and species of coral reef grapsid crab, Scutumara enodis, is described from Okinawa, Ryukyus, Japan. The new genus is allied to Pseudograpsus H. Milne Edwards, 1837, but differs in having the carapace longer than broad, the dorsal surfaces smooth and glabrous without distinct regions, the epigastric cristae weak or absent and the front well produced. Additionally, the fingers do not form a gape when closed. Two other species, Pseudograpsus laniger Tesch, 1918, and Pseudograpsus miyakei Nakamura & Takeda, 1972, are also tentatively referred to the genus Scutumara.

N2  - A new monotypic genus, Bivalvopagurus, is described for Sympagums sinensis (de Saint Laurent), a species of Parapaguridae known so far only from the China Sea. The new genus is distinguished from other genera in the family by the presence of paired pleopods in both sexes, calcification of the shield, posterior carapace, and tergites of the first two abdominal somites, and symmetry of the uropods and telson. The only species in the new genus commonly uses a bivalve shell with an actinian as means of partially protecting its abdomen. This species is redescribed and illustrated, and some evolutionary comments are made.

N2  - Five species belonging to the family Aristeidae are reported from the Pacific coast of northern Japan. One, Aristeus pallidicauda, is described as new based on a male and female specimens from off Miyako, Iwate Prefecture, at depths of 500-700 m. Plesiopenaeus edwardsianus (Johnson, 1867) is reported from northern Japan for the first time. Three species previously recorded from this area also included, Aristaeomorpha foliacea (Risso, 1827), Aristeus virilis (Bate, 1881), and Aristeus mabahissae Ramadan, 1938. The present material represents the northern limit of the distribution of these species in the western Pacific.

N2  - As a measure of internal asymmetry, laterality of the sternal artery was studied in selected species of penaeoideans, carideans, astacideans, thalassinideans, anomurans and brachyurans. Special attention was paid to a possible relationship to the asymmetry of the chelipeds. Studies showed that laterality of the artery is not related to that of the major cheliped. In penaeoideans, carideans, thalassinideans and brachyurans, an almost even variation in left and right arteries was observed, whereas hermit crabs carrying gastropod shells exclusively possessed a left-sided sternal artery. The left-sided sternal artery was also found in the Lithodidae, but not in the Pomatochelidae. The tendency for a left-sided sternal artery was observed in the Astacidae, while the reversed tendency was found in the Porcellanidae.

N2  - The external and internal features of the first and second gonopods of the adult male red frog crab Ranina ranina were examined as one of a series of the reproductive studies. In the endopod of the first gonopod, an ejaculatory canal was formed a quarter from the proximal region and a cuticular plate was observed at the apical region. The second gonopod had a spoon-like stalk region, vertically divided into two halves by a central wall. Histological examination showed that the gonopods consist of cuticle, hypodermis, loose connective tissue, striated muscles and tegumental glands. The tegumental glands are present in the proximal region of both gonopods but are not abundant. Extracellular space located at the center of the gland was PAS positive. The transferance of spermatophore to spermathecae and the function of the tegumental gland are discussed.

N2  - Seventeen species of freshwater caridean shrimps and prawns (Atyidae and Palaemonidae) are recorded from mainland Kagoshima, Uji Gunto, Ohsumi Shoto and Tokara Retto, Southern Japan. Distribution of three Macrobrachium prawns: M. equidens, M. latimanus and M. gracilirostre, are newly recorded in the surveyed areas by the present study. Though the fauna of the surveyed areas has many tropical and subtropical species, it is characterized as a complex mixture of southern and northern species. In the Sendai, Manose and Kimotsuki Rivers, the longitudinal distribution of shrimps was also surveyed. The distribution is affected by a dam or a natural vertical wall as mentioned in previous papers. The amphidromous species, Caridina leucosticta, C. serratirostris, C. typus, M.formosense, and M. japonicum, inhabited slow flowing reaches near the river mouth, while the landlocked Neocaridina denticulata and Palaemon (Palaemon) paucidens were distributed upstream from the dam or the steep reaches.

N2  - A new species of intertidal sesarmine crab, Parasesarma acts, is described from Japan and Taiwan. This species has been known under the name Sesarma (Parasesarma) erythodactyla Hess, 1865, but it is established here that P. erythodactyla is endemic to the eastern coast of Australia. Parasesarma ads is known to occur from Sagami Bay, Japan, south to Taiwan, but there are no mainland records. The two species can be easily separated on male chela characters, including the shape and number of the dactylar tubercles, and the disposition of the dorsal pectinate crests.

N2  - The growth and reproduction of the spider crab Pugettia quadridens quadridens were investigated from April 1992 to April 1993 at the Banda Marine Laboratory of Tokyo University of Fisheries, Chiba Prefecture. The larvae of P. quadridens quadridens hatch in February to August, and metamorphose to juveniles (first stage crabs) after about 17 days. The juveniles grow over the autumn to winter period. Between January and March the puberty molt which is also the terminal molt occurred in females; this was marked by the development of the secondary sexual characteristics. Soon after the puberty molt females mate and spawn. Spawning is carried out several times during a reproductive season. At about 20 days after spawning the larvae hatch, and on the same day the next brood of eggs is deposited. In summer most adults finish breeding and die. The life span of P. quadridens quadridens is estimated to be about one year in this study area.

N2  - By rearing crabs from the first zoeal stage onward, transition of the cheliped condition in Uca arcuata was studied. All the first crabs had two small chelipeds. A crab stage having only one large cheliped on either left or right side (no cheliped on the other side) was preceded by a stage having two large chelipeds. Crabs bearing asymmetrical chelipeds appeared next and increase in number commensurate with decrease of crabs bearing only one large cheliped. This observation, as well as examination of samples collected from a natural population suggests that the differentiation process of handedness in Uca arcuata is the same as that demonstrated for Uca lactea by Yamaguchi (1977).
