N2  - The ecology of an atyid shrimp Caridina japonica was studied in the Shiwagi Rivulet. Yuki Town, Tokushima Pref. This species is amphidromous in nature. The juveniles migrate upstream from the sea exclusively during the night and can be seen climbing a vertical wall, where the rivulet water is trickling down. From field observation, rheotaxis seems, to be the most important orientation mechanism for the upstream migration of juveniles. The peak month of egg incubation was June. The mean duration of incubation was 40 days at 20℃ in aquaria. From these values and with known information on the duration of larval life, it was estimated that the period of upstream migration starts in August. Most males die within two years after metamorphosis, however, many females survive for more than two years.

N2  - Oxygen consumption rates in first-stage zoea larvae of an estuarine population of Macrobrachium nipponense, characterized by laying small eggs, was maximal at the lowest and highest salinities examined (3.6 and 32.0‰ S), and minimal in the intermediate range. Reduced oxygen consumption rate at intermediate salinities was also observed in larvae of a riverine population of this species, characterized by laying large eggs. However, larvae of the riverine population did not show any significant increment of the consumption rate at higher salinities, implying that they have lost the tolerance to high environmental salinity. The pattern of oxygen consumption at various salinities in the riverine population of M nipponense was recognized to be in the intermediate state between the estuarine population of this species and a riverine population of Palaemon paucidens De HAAN.

N2  - Chromosome numbers of six species of the Palaemonidae were determinated using mocified air-dry methods applied to the tesis, the regenerating biastema of the 2nd pereopod, and the ovary after the eyestalk ablation. As shown in Table 2 of the results, chromosome numbers of four species of Macrobrachium range 2n=102 and 118, and that of two species of Palaemon 2n=108 and 136. Most of the chromosomes in the examined species were metacentric and submetacentric types. And the fundamental numbers of chromosomes had wide range between these species. Considering from these results, the specific differentiation of Palaemonidae would be characterized by some possible consequence of both Robertsonian fragmentation-fusion and chromosomal rearrangements.

N2  - Dark/light adaptational changes in the eye of the Jamaican freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium heterochirus involves distal and proximal pigment migrations as well as changes in cellular shapes. A small lens-like structure at the distal tip of the rhabdom is described for the first time in a shrimp. Rhabdoms are enlarged at night. Individuals are usually nocturnal and it is believed that under dim light conditions, larger crabs have a double-advantage over small ones: not only are they stronger: they also see better in the dark. It is finally suggested that tapetal cells may respond directly to light without hormones getting involved.

N2  - Spawned eggs of Trachypenaeus curvirostris were incubated under-laboratory condition in order to examine their early life history and to compare their embryonic development with those of other penaeid species. As development progressed, samples of embryo were collected, photomicrographed and preserved in 4% formaldehyde/seawater solution buffered with sodium tetraborate. The breeders started to spawn between 21:00-00:00h. Fecundities ranged between 6,400 to 106,700 eggs. The derived correlation equation between fecundity and carapace length of breeders was Y=log(-352.215+18.6561X) (r=0.94^*). Egg size enlarged from 223μm at spawning to 400μm just before hatching. After 15h 13min at 26±0.2℃ and 32.5 ppt, 56.49% of the eggs hatched as first nauplius larvae covered with amnion-like sac. However 19.9% of the nauplius stage remained embryonized and 10.3% hatched when they reached first protozoea stage after 60h 13min. This is the first time that embryonized nauplius and protozoea stages have been reported in the ontogeny of species in the Family Penaeidae.

N2  - The lobsterette Nephropsis stewarti beronging to the family Nephropidae, were reared in the aquarium to observe habitat behavior of redused eye crustacea. Observations carried out during 1982 to 1984. All the specimens collected at 350-400m depth of Suruga Bay, off Heda Mura. Shizuoka prefecture, Japan were carried to Shimoda Marine Station Nihon University, Shimoda-Shi. Shizuoka and reared in the 1000 liter round shaped tank with running sea water. Water temperature kept at 10-12℃. The bottom of reared tank covered with fine sand. Alive starfish caught simultaneously, frozen fish and krill, alive seaurchin, artificial diet for carp were fed. Four lobsterette specimens were reared and most longest surviving period was 112 days. Remarkable habitat were, they did not show any respons to the light and walked around on the bottom through day and night but never burrowed like other animal of the Family Nephropidae. Of the diets examined, only the starfish was fed by animals. Although the feeding behavior was not observed directly.

N2  - Burrows of the Japanese crayfish Cambaroides japonicus (DE HAAN, 1841) in a stream in Sapporo, Hokkaido are described. The density of number of openings averaged 4.5/m^2 in ten reserch stations around the banks. The diameters of dominant particles were 0.125-0.400 mm at the central part of stations. Six resin casts of burrows showed that this species excavated a semistraight tunnel with two openings near the water surface of the stream. This tunnel was almost horizontal and was semicylindrical in cross-section with the floor flat. Some were also observed Y or T shaped burrows.

N2  - Crayfish in Lake Mashu, Hokkaido, Japan, were captured with tangle nets in the summer of 1992. All specimens, 171 males and 517 females, had intermediate diagnostic character between two subspecies, Pacifastacus leniusculus leniusculus and P, l. trowbridgii. Although three very large individuals of unidentified crayfish were captured in this lake by poachers of trout in 1975 and 1985, there is no certain confirmation because of illegal samplings. One of the present authors took a chance to measure one of them, a fresh male crayfish with very large chelae, in 1975 when he was 11 years old and recorded only its giant size, i.e. 47 cm carapace length. However, the largest P. leniusculus collected in this study was 5.7cm in c. l. Neoteny may have occurred because there is no secondary sexual character on chelae of adult P. leniusculus males. This lake has no river. Age of the lake is estimated as about 2000 years old. Further, all species of fish and crustaceans in the lake were artificially introduced from other waters. Of crayfish, only P. leniusculus occurs and was introduced from Portland, Oregon, U.S.A., in 1930. From these, the unidentified gigantic crayfish seems to have been P. leniusculus grown to a giant size.

N2  - The external changes with molting of a crayfish, Cambaroides japonicus (DE HAAN, 1841), were studied in aquaria. Softening and transparency of the exoskeleton, appearance of the gelatinous substance, and darkening of the body color were observed in molting. These changes appeared from five days before molting to twelve days after it. Four molting phases based on these changes and the period of them seemed to be useful to estimate the molting times in the natural habitat.

N2  - The distributions of the phyllosoma and nisto larvae of Scyllarus kitanoviriosus HARADA were investigated in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, in use of a small beam trawl net that was towed at 17 stations in daytime, during the period from December 1986 to November 1987. The stations were placed along isobaths of every 5 m of depth in an area shallower than 30 m in depth. Eightythree phyllosoma larvae (stages III-VIII) were caught in the season from August to November, and 32 nisto larvae only in September and October. The distribution of the stage VIII phyllosoma was identical to that of the stages III to VII. The nisto larvae appeared significantly in shallower area than the phyllosoma. Neither juvenile nor adult was caught with the trawl employed. The gillnet operated near rocky shore however, caught adults, of which the females were all ovigerous in September. This fact suggests that the last stage phyllosoma metamorphoses into the nisto in 15-25 m deep in September to October, and then metamorphoses into early juvenile stage after the settlement onto the rocky bed.

N2  - Polyester resin casts of burrows of the thalassinidean ghost shrimp, Callianassa japonica ORTMANN, were collected on an intertidal sand flat in west Kyushu, Japan. One burrow cast obtained in September 1989 and another, obtained in September 1990, had a thin "branch" originating from the stout adult burrow cast. Evidence pointed to such branches being inhabited by newly recruited individuals of C. japonica. It is believed that settling larvae and/or newly settled juveniles had entered the surface openings of the adult burrows to later branch off independently.

Ovigerous females were found from April through August and most abundant in June-July. Males' sexual behaviors were observed from May through July or August and most frequent in June-July. Females were suggested to spawn or release their larvae around spring tide. Daily frequency of males' sexual behaviors did not fluctuate according to tidal condition of spring to neap tides. Proportions of waving males and wandering crabs declined in the late breeding to the nonbreeding season, indicating relation of waving and wandering to reproductive activity.

I. pusilla is distributed along the coast of mainland Japan and Okinawa, while I. deschampsi ranged along the continental coast of Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihle), Yellow Sea and northern East China Sea. The distributions of the two spesies overlap only at the southern coast of Korea and a part of northern Kyushu of Japan, and both species do not extend into the Japan Sea coast. Along the coast of Ariake Bay in Kyushu, Japan, where both species occurred, their distributions were investigated in detail. I. deschampsi was distributed on the innermost coast, while I. pusilla was on the coast of outer part of the bay, showing clear segregated distributions between them. In habitat conditions, there were some differences between the two species : soil hardness and coarseness of substratum, and salt content of underground water were, on the average, higher in the habitat of I. pusilla than in that of I, deschampsi.

N2  - Twenty-one sexually paired hair crabs, Erimacrus isenbeckii (Brandt) were collected from the northwestern North Pacific, off Kushiro during August 1986 〜 July 1991. The paired hair crabs acted the precopulatory guarding behavior. Size distributions were unimodal for each ,sex but with few overlap in their carapace length (CL). The mean CL of male and female were 89.4 mm and 56.2 mm respectively. Other than the fact that males were invariably larger than females, there was no correlation between size of the male and size of the female with which it was paired. Sizes distribution of females paired with small (CL< 90 mm) and large (CL≧90 mm) size males were the same. Based on these data, we discussed size assortative mating and sexual dimorphism on the hair crab. In this species, male size is not correlated with female size in sexual pairs. However, cleary sexual dimorphism is observed.

The megalopae and crabs were collected by hand every three days from April to June 1 2, 1990. To detect the main mechanism by which the megalopae were driven to the intertidal habitat from offshore, the following weather and tidal conditions were recorded: the lunar cycle, surface water temperature, wind direction and velocity. There was no apparent relationship between the number of megalopae that settled and the lunar cycle or the water temperature. Whereas, there existed strong relationship between settlement of megalopae and the prevailing north wind.

N2  - The morphological characteristics of the exoskeleton in the abult and juvenile stages of the female Japanese mitten crab, Eriocheir japonicus were recorded with reference to the shape of the abdomen, the exposure of the edges of the thoracic sternums, and the growth of hairs in the margin of the abdomen, 1st〜4th thoracic sternums, and abdominal appendages. External changes which take place during molting were also examined. During the juvenile stage (carapace measuring less than 70 mm in width), the abdomen was found to grow relatively larger, both in length and in width gradually, during pre-puberty molting. However, when the crabs were reaching the abult stage (carapace greater than 35 mm in width), the abdomen was found to drastically grow larger during puberty molting, until it nearly covered the thoracic sternums.

N2  - American edible crab, Callinectes sapidus RATHBUN has recently been obtained from Sagami Bay. Up to now there are two reports on the occurrence of this crab in Japanese waters. The first record was accounted by SATAKI in 1976, on the basis of the specimens obtained by a fisherman in 1975 at the Hamana Lake, Shizuoka prefecture. The second one was given by ARIYAMA in 1985. He described briefly on a female crab obtained from Osaka Bay in September of 1984. This short report deals with a brief account on the third record of this crab from Japanese waters.

N2  - Hypertypic regeneration was induced by wounding of the rostrum in the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. A slightly projecting structure was formed at the site of the wound on the rostrum rim at the third molt after the rostrum rim at the third molt had been wounded. The structure elongated at each molt for three or four consecutive molts.

N2  - The genus Enoplometopus was placed in the Nephropidae of Infraorder Astacidea. Based on the morphological characters, it is classified in the Axiidae of Infraorder Anomura (HOLTHUIS 1946, 74, 83). Little have been known about the larvae of this genus. Obserations on the larvae of E. occidentalis are reported here. Larvae were cultured for 55 days until 8th zoeal stage. The larvae bear large 1st pereiopod from 1st zoea, and they use the chelae for feeding. Other larval characters were similar to those of the Axiidae: long rostrum,shape of endopod of 1st maxilipeds, pereiopods 4th and 5th have delayed development, and post marginal setae on the tail. These characters indicate that E. occidentalis may belonging to the Axiidae. The 8th zoeal stage closely resembles the larva described for Enoplometopus sp. by GURNEY(1938). The larva of Nephrops sp. described in that report is also similar to the 2nd zoeal stage of E. occidentalis. It is proposed that these two larvae described by Gurney belong to Enoplometopus.

N2  - The First zoeas obtained from egg beared female of Cyrtomaia owstoni were reared in the laboratory. Three parent crabs trowled from Suruga-Bay,300m depth, off Heda, Shizuoka prefecture on Dec.26, 1983. Among them, one egg beared crab was found 45 days after, and hatching occured 100 days after catching. The first zoea was 2.8mm in length rostrum to dosal spine. Zoeal featurs as follows ; dosal spine comparetively long; antennal exopod ends three forked; endopod of maxillule 2 segmented with bearing 4 teminal plus 2 setae and I setae each: endopod of maxilla beared 4 terminal setae, basal and coxal endite bilobed; endopod of 1st, maxilliped 5 segmented with setation 3-2-1-2-5 and endopod of 2nd. maxilliped 3 segmented with setation 0-1-4. Those features were very similar to C.hispida first zoea reported by WEAR and FIELDER (1985).

N2  - Distribution pattern of the porcelain crab, Petrolisthes japonicus found in the intertidal boulder beaches of an oceanic island, Chichijima, Ogasawara (Bonin) was compared with that in a continental island, Zamami, Okinawa (Ryukyu). P. japonicus occupied widely over the entire intertidal boulder beaches in Ogasawara, where only one species of the porcelain crab inhabits. In Okinawa, however, P. japonicus was restricted in the middle intertidal zone and its habitat was significantly narrower and higher than those on Chichijima. In Okinawa, six other species of porcelain crabs, P. hastatus. P. lamarckii, P. fimbriatus, P. tomentosus, P. carinipes and P, asiaticus coexisted there, and the distribution patterns of them can be clearly divided into two types: the middle intertidal type, (P. japonicus and P. hastatus) and the lower intertidal type (P. asiaticus, P. tomentosus, P. lamarckii. P, fimbriatus and P. carinipes.

The both species occured zonally in the shelf of 33° N to 26° N along the shelf edge. Area of high abundance was in the waters north of 31° N for I. c. ciliatus and south of 29°30′ N for I. novemdentatus. I. c. ciliatus inhabited mostly in the areas of 120m and deeper, compared with I. novemdentatus in the areas of 100-120m depth.

N2  - Fighting for a shelter between Palaemon pacificus and P.serrifer were investigated in aquaria. In both interspecific and intraspecific fighting,the smaller individuals were usually eliminated by the larger ones from the shelter. In the case that smaller individual was a winner, P. serrifer won more often than P. pacificus although P. serrifer was smaller. The second pereiopod was longer in P. serrifer than in P. pacificus. P. serrifer made up for smaller body size by larger second pereiopod length than P. pacificus relatively.

N2  - The growth and the reproduction of the spider crab, Tiarinia cornigera was investigated at the Banda Marine Laboratory of Tokyo University of Fisheries. Chiba prefecture, and the outline of the life history was determined. The larvae of T. cornigera hatch in June to September, and metamorphose to juveniles crabs in 7 to 10 days. The juveniles grow rapidly in autumn. In winter the growth stagnates, but in spring again they grow rapidly. In June to July the puberty molt which is also the terminal molt occurs, with the development of the second sexual characteristics. Soon they mate and spawn. In a reproductive season a female spawns 4 to 6 times. At about 20 days after spawning the larvae hatch and a further brood deposited. In autumn the most of adults finished breeding are die out. It is suggested that the life span of T. cornigera is about one year in this study area.

N2  - Giant spider crab, Macrocheira haempferi (TEMMINCK), with a median rostral tooth instead of a pair of rostral spines, and Japanese spiny lobster, Panulirus japonicus (VON SIEBOLD), with the heteromorphic antennule in place of right eyestalk, are recorded respectively from Suruga Bay and the coast of the Boso Peninsula, central Japan. It is definitely said that the malformation of the rostrum is caused by the extended true rostrum being not descended during its development as a septum of the antennular fossae of both sides. On the other hand, the heteromorphic antennule is rather rare in the field, only with some records in spiny lobsters and crawfishes, and also in a freshwater atyd shrimp, but HERBST (1895-1916) and some recent authors experimentally caused the heteromorphic antennules not only in the shrimps and lobsters, but also in the hermit crabs and porcelain crab. According to them, the heteromorphic antennules are functional in response to mechanical and olfactory stimulation, and such heteromorphosis is produced only when the optic ganglion is severed along with eyestalk.

N2  - The present paper deals with the breeding ecology of two dogielinotid amhipods on the five sandy-beaches in southern Hokkaido. Japan. Haustorioides japonicus and H. munsterhjelmi are semelparity species. The peaks of egg-laying in H. japonicus population on the Omori-beach. Hakodate were observed four or five times in a breeding season, and these peaks synchronized with the semi-lunar cycle. In the first half of breeding season, the large size females occupied the majority in the latter half. The number of eggs per brood in both species is positively, correlated to the female body length. Mean fecundity ranges from 70 to 87 eggs in the first generation of H. japonicus, and the ranges from 84 to 106 eggs in H. munsterhjelmi. Dogielinotid amhipods seems to be productive comparing with other gammarid families.

The early developmental stages of Haustorioides japonicus and H. munsterhjelmi were observed, and five clearly defined stages were regognized within the brood pouch of female by morphological characteristics. The characteristics of juveniles just after hatching were observed in detail, and compared with those of adult specimens. From these observation, it was clear that these juveniles could be identified immediatory to the species level. Loss of embryos in brood pouch was about 18-41% just before hatching, and 37-56% just before releace from the brood pouch of H. japonicus. High mortality during early development were observed between stage III and stage IV, and between stage V and stage VI.

N2  - Three types of the life cycle of the atyid shrimp Neocaridina denticulata were observed in the Sugow River, Japan. A short generation cohort (type I) showed high growth at the high water temperatures occurring after hatching in early June ; many ovigerous females were observed subsequently in early and middle August and they died. A long generation cohort (type II) hatched in mid July and large females incubated eggs during late August and late September but they grew little at low water temperature from November to the following March and ovigerous females appeared again in May. Hatching of another long generation cohort (type III) occurred in late August ; growth recommenced after the months which of low water temperature ; and females incubated eggs during early June and early August. The population were consisted of two groups which took the same cyclic change of generation types, I→III→II→I→III→II→I→(continued), with time lag of a year each other. Growth equations over the life cycle for types I→III, including seasonal variation, ate described. The influence of mest size selection, by sweep nets, on sample size frequency distributions in also discussed.

Decrease of the animal density was caused by shallow depth indicating water volume of the habitat. The relationship between carapace length (X, mm) and number of eggs attached to pleopods (Y) was Y=-50.69+4.704X. In the stream, spawning season is March and April. Hatching is caused in June and July. An adult female spawns one time in a year.

N2  - Sexual dimorphism of Palaemon pacificus and P. serrifer were investigated during 1987 to 1989 in Tateyama Bay, Chiba Prefecture. It was found that both the rostral length and the number of segments of the inner branch of the bifurcated outer flagellum were larger in males than in females. The difference between male and female appeared nearly the size of the minimual ovigerous female. Difference between male and female on both the rostrum and the inner branch of the bifurcated outer flagellum appeared with maturing.

N2  - Observation upon the feeding habit of Eriphia smithii were made from May to September in 1988 at rocky shore near Banda Marine Station of Tokyo University of Fisheries in Chiba Prefecture. Observations were recorded, forty eight in total. Most foraged organisms for food were Polyplacophora and Patellacea (52.1%). Predation on Brachyura and Pelecypoda were observed seven (16.7%) and six (12.5%) times respectively. The other animal groups as food were observed less than four times.

N2  - The giant spider crab, Macrocheira kaenpferi, Takaashigani (Japanese name) is the largest of all living Arthropoda. The leg span of a large adult male is 4 meters. This crab is found along the Pacific coast of Japan, from Kamaishi to Kyusyu districts at depths ranging from 50 to 400 meters. Studies on both spawning and the early larvae forms of the crab were reported before. We have now succeeded in rearing this crab from, the megalopa stage to the juvenile stage. This short report is dealt with these result and some other observations.

N2  - Oviposition, release of larvae and molting were investigated for individual Gaetice depressus (DE HAAN) crabs reared throughout the year in the laboratory. Oviposition and larvae release occurred from April to October or November. Molting occurred throughout nearly the entire year, although few crabs molted in winter. Most of the crabs molted shortly after the breeding season. The length of oviposition season and the number of ovipositions varied among individual females, and were not correlated with body size but affected by molting. The period between larvae release and the next oviposition was longer when molting occurred within that interval. The start of oviposition at the beginning of the breeding season tended to be affected by the preceding molting. Rearing of females isolated from males showed that females of this species can store sperm and then fertilize 3 broods of eggs. Stored sperm is considered to be retained through molting.

N2  - The larval development of the land crad, Cardisoma hirtipes DANA, reared under laboratory conditions, is described and illustrated. The larvae passed through five zoeal stages before they molted to the megalopal stage. Only a few zoeas succeeded in metamorphosing into the megalopal stage in 13 days at a water temperature of about 28℃. Larval relationships are discussed among C. carnifex, C. hirtipes and C. guanhumi, C. hirtipes and C. guanhumi shares most of the essential features in zoeal and megalopal stages, but C. carnifex is distant from these two species in having spinous abdominal segments and an elongate telson.

N2  - Larvae of five species of Japanese xanthid crabs, Medaeops granulosus, Paraxanthias elegans, Novactaea pulchella, Pilumnus vespertilio and P. scabriusculus, were reared in the laboratory from hatching to the last zoea or megalopa stage. They were fed on Artemia salina (L.) nauplii. Their zoeae are described and illustrated in detail, and compared with xanthid crab zoeae in the literature. Under the laboratory conditions, each species has a definite number of zoea stages ; M. granulosus, Paraxanthias elegans and Pilumnus scabriusculus have four zoea stages, Pilumnus vespertilio has three, and N. pulchella has two. The xanthid subfamilies can be classified into eight groups based upon the morphological feature of the antenna II and the setal formulae of endopods of the maxillae I and II of the known xanthid crab zoeae. As a result of these zoeal characters, the genus Halimede appears to have a closer relationship to the subfamily Pilumninae rather than to the subfamily Xanthinae. Furthermore, a key is given to the zoeae of twenty-seven species of xanthid crabs from Japan. The most primitive stock among the xanthid crabs may be xanthinid group including genus Halimede mentioned-above. The ancestral stock provably divided into four lines ; one leading to the Hyperolissa and Zalasinae, one to the Trapeziinae, one to the Pilumninae, and one to the modern Menippinae including the genera Menippe and Sphaerozius.

N2  - The life histories of Haustorioides japonicus KAMIHIRA and H. munsterhjelmi (OLDEVIG), amhipods were investigated in the sandy beaches of the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan. There was a delicate difference in the alternation of generations of H. japonicus in each study. A bivoltine reproductive cycle was exhibited in Date-usu : a generation recruited in spring produced in summer a generation that overwintered and reproduced in the following spring. On the other hand, the univoltine reproductive cycle was observed in Hakodate. In Iwanai and Setana, the majority of numbers were univoltine, and a small number were bivoltine. It seems that the main reason for the differences in alternation of generation was the level of the sea water temperature in spring and summer in each study area. H. munsterhjelmi showed a univoltine reproductive cycle in Mukawa-shiomi. The habitat of these amphipods was observed in the littoral zone and the sublittoral zone. The breeding season was spring or summer.

N2  - Previously, the third to fifth zoeal stage and one megalopa stage of Tritodynamia horvathi NOBILI found in the plankton had been reported by the junior author (1983) . Recently, the present authors collected the berried female crabs of this species from the Yatsushiro-Kai, Kumamoto Prefecture. These crabs were reared in the laboratory for observation of the larval development. In the present paper, the larvae of the first and second zoeal stages of this species are described and illustrated, and also compared with these zoeal stages of a relative species, T. japonica ORTMANN reported by TERADA (1987).

N2  - Early and middle larval development of P. penicillatus reared in the laboratory for 160 days was examined. Although no puerulus was obtained, the larval development during the experiment was morphologically divided into seven stages. Average molting intervals were around six days for instars I-III and ten days after instar V. In most cases, one pair of setae was regularly added on the exopod of the 3rd maxilliped after instar II and those on the exopod of the 1st and the 2nd pereopods after instar V. Growth in body length and other body parts was indicated as an exponential curve. The growth patterns of the antennular and the antennal length and the abdominal width were changed at stage V. Morphological variations in larval development among individuals in the same instar were observed after instar IV. Early-stage phyllosomas of P. penicillatus were distinguished from other phyllosomas of the present genus in having two spinules on the proximal segment of the maxilla, in stead of three spinules in others.

N2  - The relative growth of chela was examined to estimate the size at maturity for male tanner crabs, Chionoecetes opilio and C. bairdi collected from the Bering Sea, the Okhotsk Sea and the Japan Sea. The size (carapace width) at maturity of male tanner crab varied among different waters for each species, being largest in the Japan Sea and smallest in the northeastern Bering Sea. Similar variations were found in the maximum size of crabs collected. The size at maturity and the maximum size of crabs are possibly related to their environmental temperature.

N2  - A total of 245 deep-sea lithode crabs, Paralomis verrilli was captured by sampling trawl nets and crab pots at depths ranging between 580 and 870 m in the eastern Okhotsk Sea. The environmental temperature ranged from 1.1℃ to 2.2℃ and comparable temperature m neighboring 200〜400 m depths water ranged from -1.3℃ to 1.4℃. Relative growth of P. verrilli was examined based upon measurements in 32 males and 37 females. The relative growth of appendages shows that there are differences in the growth rates between male and female crabs after they have reached 53 to 65 mm in carapace width suggesting that the crabs become mature when they attained about 60 mm in carapace width. Mature females have from 2000 to 7800 fostering eggs attached to their abdominal appendages. The relationship between carapace width X and number of fostering eggs Y can be expressed as Y=0.05804X^<2.4833>. Twelve crabs out of 36 mature females captured in early June had fostering eggs at the late nauplius stage and the others had younger fostering eggs newly spawned and the crabs in this waters seems to have their spawning season from April to June.

N2  - Association of pontoniid shrimp, Periclimenes soror NOBILI, with four species of starfish was observed in the lagoon of Kuroshima Island (24°15′N, 124°O′E) during a period from April to September, 1985. Compositions of the carapace length of the shrimp were different by sex of the shrimp and host species. Females were generally larger than males. The females associated with the crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci LINNE, were larger than the shrimps associated with other three starfish species. The color of the shrimp was divisible into four types. The females changed their color types with growth. On a host, at maximum 53 shrimps were observed, and the numbers of males and females of them were random. We released forty-nine tagged starfish without shrimps, and ten days after, recaptured the four starfish with ovigerous female shrimps. This result indicates that they move from one host to another. P. soror uses a starfish as a shelter, and probably eats mucus of the host. But, it seems that the association of P. soror with their host is not so close as that of other associated shrimps, such as coral associates.

N2  - Calcinus latens is the hermit crab widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. Many authors have reported that C. latens uses gastropod shells having regular whorls and showing regular conical shape, however I found in a coral reef of Guam that many individuals of C. latens used shells of irregular whorls or peculiar shapes, such as the shells of Vermetidae, Cypraeidae, Conidae and they are highly damaged. These shells are significantly heavier than the shells of normal type and sometimes their center of gravity is various. It has been reported that heavier shells influence the growth rate and clutch size of hermit crabs and that unbalanced shells restrict the locomotion ability of hermit crabs. Thus this condition is regarded as worse for C. latens, and may result from the scarcity of normal shells in the reef.

N2  - Polymorphism in the male major chelae of the hermit crab, Diogenes nitidimanus is reported. Broad type, in which the palm is broad with many distinct teeth and granules, and Narrow type, in which the palm is narrow with irregular-sized granules, as well as several intermediate types were found. Other morphological characters are nearly alike in these types and perfectly fit the descriptions of Diogenes nitidimanus given by TERAO (1913) and MIYAKE (1978). The possible relation between the body size and chela type is suggested.

Larval characters are compared with those in AIKAWA'S (1927) report. Larval features within the genus Petrolisthes, including the present species, are also compared. Three major groups can be distinguished using two characteristics : the scaphognathite of the maxilla, and the number of segments in the first maxillipedal endopod.

N2  - Three larval stages of Ismaila occulta Ho are described, including copepodid II, copepodid III, and both sexes of copepodid IV. These larvae together with their adults were found inside the cerata of a giant red nudibranch collected from Alamitos Bay, Long Beach, California. It is speculated that the free-swimming nauplius of I. occulta developed into copepodid I before infecting nudibranch and there are five copepodid stages in the life cycle. The absence of maxilliped and leg 4 in the adult I. occulta is due to the developmental arrest of these appendages in the larval stages. An analysis of the available ontogenetic information of Poecilostomatoida indicates that Splanchnotrophidae is related to Philichthyidae and Myicolidae, particularly to the former family.

N2  - The Xanthid crab Eriphia smithii preys on hermit crabs. Two chelae, ambulatory legs, and mouth parts are used for capturing them. The crab breaks shells with hermit crabs in them by using its massive and powerful master, claw. About 70% of the crabs are right-handed. Many species of shells occupied by hermit crabs are found at Banda Shore. E. smithii breaks these shells.

N2  - Larvae of the swimming crab, Thalamita prymna (HERBST), were successfully reared in the laboratory from hatching to the last zoeal stage. They were fed on Artemia salina (L.) nauplii. These zoeal stages are described and illustrated herein, and compared with those of the related two species, T, sima H. MILNE EDWARDS and T. danae STIMPSON. The zoeae of the three species are very similar in general appearance, but they are distinguishable in the following characters. In the complete larval development, T. prymna may have four zoeal stages before reaching the megalopa stage, while in T. danae there are three zoeal stages, and T. sima has five (KURATA, 1975) or six (TERADA, 1979) . The zoea of T. prymna has no chromatophore on the lateral surface of carapace which is present in that of T. sima. The first zoea of the Japanese T. prymna and T. sima is provided with ten setae on the basipod of maxilliped I, whereas that of the Australian T. danae has nine. The three closely reiated species are also distinguished from one another by bearing the different setations on the exopods of maxillipeds I and II.

N2  - Postlarvae of the genus Penaeus were collected with the aid of light attraction inside Ohara fishing port, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, from May to October, over a 3-year period, 1982-1984. A total of 1,130 individuals were collected consisting of three species. Among them, postlarvae of P. japonicus were by far the most dominant species representing 93.5% of the total catch, followed by P. semisulcatus (3.8%) and P. monodon (2.7%), and their modal carapace lengths were 1.7, 1.7 and 2.6 mm, respectively. A period of their major occurrence was from mid-July to mid-September.

N2  - Thirty-five species of penaeoid prawns, representing 9 genera in 3 families, have been found over a period of 5 years from 1976 to 1980 in the Philippine waters. Of these, 15 species have been recorded for the first time from the country. Keys for the identification of genera and species, and descriptions as well as illustrations of 35 species except for the illustration of Metapenaeus moyebi are provided. Twelve species out of the 35 species are commercially important. They are Metapenaeus anchistus, M. dalli as well as M. moyebi, M. ensis. Penaeus indicus, P. japonicus, P. latisulcatus, P. merguiensis, P. monodon, P. semisulcatus, Solenocera alticarinata, and S. melantho, of which P. monodon is the greatest because of its large size, abundant occurrence of the fry and easier cultivation in the pond, and furthemore, other five Penaeus species are of great potential for an aquaculture in brackishwater fishponds.

N2  - Larval development of Chilean Cancer species comprises one prezoeal stage, five zoeal and one megalopal stages. The prezoeae observed in this study emerge from the eggs as a free and active swimming larvae, lasting about 15 minutes before molting to the typical first zoea. Embryonic cuticle rounds completely the larva, forming long, setose, soft sheaths on antennules, antenna and telson ; all the parabuccal appendages are rudimentaries and unfunctional. A key for to identify the studied species is presented and furthermore, some comments concerning other previously reported prezoeae are also presented. Prezoea larvae are described and illustrated in detail.

N2  - One male specimen of the Cancroid Crab was obtained by a smelt-beam trawl from a depth of 15m, off Kushiro, the Pacific coast of Hokkaido, on November 16, 1979. It was identified by Dr. T. SAKAI of the Carcinological Society of Japan as Cancer magister DANA. This crab is one of the important provision resources in U.S.A. (Known as the dungeness crab or common edible crab), ranging along the Pacific coast of North America, from Unalaska, Alaskan Peninsula, south-ward to Montebery Bay, California. It has recently been imported from America to Japan as an edible crab, sold at the markets of Tokyo and Yokohama by the false name of "American swimming crab". Cancer magister is morphologically characterized by having the carapace widest at the last or tenth antero-lateral tooth, and the antero-lateral teeth are low and their tips directed forwards. The postero-lateral borders are unbroken and entire. Fingers of chelipeds are not pigmented with black color. This crab was obtained for the first time in Japan as well as in the north-western Pacific areas. The author is not certain whether this crab was migrated from northwestern coast of America of Alaska, by influence of the cold northern current, or its young or larval crab had been transported by means of the ballast water tunk of a ship. On the other hand, the author's interest has been aroused by the fact that the five American and Alaskan flounder-Embassichthys bathybius had been recorded for the first time in the Pacific coast of Hokkaido by AMAOKA et al. in 1978 (loc. cit.).

N2  - Zoeae of the five varunid crabs, Eriocheir japonicus DE HAAN, Hemigrapsus sanguieneus (DE HAAN) , H. Penicillatus (DE HAAN) , H. longitarsis (MIERS) and Gaetice depressus (DE HAAN) , of the family Grapsidae were successfully reared in the laboratory from hatching to the megalopa stage. Artemia nauplii were given as food. In this paper, the zoeal stages of all the species are described in detail and those of H. longitarsis are figured. The zoeae of these species are compared with those of the other members of the Subfamily Varuninae so far studied by previous writers. As in H. nudus, H. oregoniensis and Acmaeopleura parvula, the five species herein dealt with have five zoeal stages before transforming into the megalopa. The zoeae of the varunid crabs are very similar in structure one another, although minor differences are found among different genera. As to the five species, zoeae of genus Hemigrapsus are different from those of the other two genera (Eriocheir and Gaetice) by the occurrence of one small seta on the anterior lateral surface of scaphognathite in the last stage and also in setation of basal endite of maxilla I in stage IV. Furthermore, zoeae of the two species of genus Eriocheir and the five species of Hemigrapsus can be distinguished from those of the genera, Acmaeopleura and Caetice, by having lateral carapace spines. Among the nine known species differences are found in the presence or absence of chromatophores on protopod of maxilliped II, mid-lateral spines on abdominal segments II and III, setation on endopod of maxilliped II, and the type of antenna II.

N2  - Larvae of six species of the subfamily Acanthonychinae (family Majidae) : Pugettia quadridens quadridens (DE HAAN), P. q. intermedis SAKAI, P. incisa DE HAAN), P. similis Rathbun, Menaethius monoceros (LATREILLE) and Huenia proteus DE HAAN, were successfully reared in the laboratory from hatching to the megalopa stage by feeding on Artemia nauplii. The numbers of zoeal stages are only two in the six species. These zoeae may be classified into two groups. In the first group. to which the genus Pugettia, chromatophores are present at the bases of rostral and dorsal carapace spines and on protopod of maxilliped I, setation of endopod of maxilla I is 4・0-1, that of inner lobe of coxal endite of maxilla II is 1:3, caudal furca of telson is twice as long as width of telson, and the articulation of telson occurred in stage II. In the other group including genera Menaethius and Huenia, no chromatophores are present at the three parts, setations of endopod of maxilla I and inner lobe of coxal endite of maxilla II are 4・1-0 and 1:4, caudal furca and width of telson are about equal in length, and the articulation disappears in stage II. Specific differences in the characters of zoeae are as follows. In genus Pugettia (the first group), P. incisa has setation of 3 on endopod of maxilla II, but the other three species have 4. Furthermore, P. q. intermedis has nine setae on basal endite of maxilla I in stage II, in contrast, P. q. quadridens and P. similis possessing ten in the same stage. In the two species of the second group, M. monoceros has rostral spine, but neither dorsal nor lateral ones on carapace and setation of 5 on endopod of maxilla II, whereas H. proteus having rostral and dorsal spines, and setation of 4.

N2  - Diagnostic features for the identification of postlarval Penaeus found in the shore waters of the Philippines are described and categorized based on specimens caught from the wild and those hatched and reared in the laboratory. Differentiating features for postlarval Penaeus are given which include the relative length of the antennular flagellum, the shape of the rostrum and number of rostral teeth, the antennal spine, the spinules on the dorsal carina of the sixth abdominal segment, and chromatophore patterns. Postlarval Penaeus were classified into two species and two groups as follows : (1) P. monodon, larger in size with dense chromatophores, and the long inner antennular flagellum being more than 2.0 times the outer antennular flagellum ; (2) P. semisulcatus, the inner flagellum being 1.6 to 2.0 times the outer antennular flagellum, with the absence of chromatophore on the middle portion of the telson and uropods ; (3) P, merguiensis group, less pigmented, the inner flagellum being less than 1.6 times the outer flagellum and (4) P. japonicus group, a short rostrum, presence of spinules on the dorsal carina of the sixth abdominal segment, and dense chromatophores. The determinations were confirmed by rearing experiments.

N2  - A simple technique is described for obtaining well-spread metaphases from solid tissues of Crustacer. The procedure of chromosome preparation was as follows : 1) Specimens were injected intraperitoneally with colchicine solution at the dosage of I pg per 1μg body weight five hours before being dissected. 2) Remove antennal gland and testis, and cut them into 3mm pieces where necessary. 3) Place tissue pieces in the hypotonic solution (distilled water or 0.01M KCl) for 10 minutes. 4) Add small quantity of Carnoy's fluid (3:1 ethanol acetic acid). 5) Fix in at least two changes of Carnoy's fluid for at least 15 minutes each. 6) Pick tissue pieces up from Carnoy's fluid by a forceps, and tap to spread them on a slide glass for a proper density of cells. 7) Drop Carnoy's fluid on the slide from a fine pipet. 8) Dry quickly by flaming. 9) Stain with 2% Giemsa for 15 minutes. Large numbers of slides of chromosome can be made easily and rapidly using this procedure.

N2  - The habitats, nest burrows, hibernation, awaking, molting, copulation. oviposition, egg-bearing, zoea-liberation (spawning) , beach landing of the tiny young, and so on of the land-crab, Sesarma (Holometopus) haematocheir (DE HAAN), were studied from April, 1979 to November, 1980. Field observation was made in the rocky shore near the Sado Marine Biological Station of Niigata University located on the west coast of Sado Island in the Japan Sea. When the ground temperature (GT) fell gradually 16℃, the crabs emerged from the nest and went to the beach for feeding. Molting occurred from late June to middle September, although in mother crab it took place since August after the release of zoeal larvae. Copulation was found from late June to early August, and the frequency of copulation and next oviposition in one spawning season were two to three times per crab. Zoea release took place almost every night about one or two hours after sunset (ca. 19:00) during the period from late July to early September, although no spawning was encountered in stormy weather. Beach landing of an infant crab just metamorphosed from megalopa was seen in late September, and the first molting occurred in a pool two or three days after landing. Difference between the spawning behavior of this land-crab occurring in the Japan Sea coast and in the Pacific coast was discussed in relation to the difference of the tidal changes in the both coasts.

N2  - The ecological distribution of phytal amphipods on seaweeds were investigated in a Sargassum bed at the coast of Tomioka Peninsula, Amakusa, Kyushu. Eight plants of 4 Sargassum species were collected underwater by the vertically stratified sampling method in May when these seaweeds fuliy grown up. By this sampling, 10 species of caprellids and 21 species of gammarids were obtained. The similarities among epiphytic amphipod assemblages of each host plant were analyzed for Caprellidae and Gammaridea respectively. These assemblages resembled each other, consequently it was speculated that these epiphytic amphipods generally have no specific preference to the host plants. Simultaneously, two groups were recognized in both taxa, namely, one group consists of S, patens and S. horneri which were collected in the outer part of the Sargassum bed, another is S. thunbergii and S. hemiphyllum which mainly flourish inside. The difference seemed to be caused by the factors which related with wave action or other hydrodynamic conditions. In the vertical distribution of the biomass of each alga, the weight of higher part was normally heavier than that of lower part, and this tendency was also observed in the individual number of amphipods on each part. Vertical distribution of 6 species of amphipods (Caprella decipiens, C. danilevskii, C. tsugarensis, Ampithoe orientalis, Aoroides columbiae, Pontogeneia rostrata) showed high positive correlations with those of seaweeds biomass. Exclusive of S. horneri, C. monoceros and Phliantidae sp. 1 also showed positive correlations with the vertical distribution of seaweed biomass like other species. On S. horneri, however, they mainly occurred on the lower part of seaweed and showed negative correlation.

N2  - The morphological development of the early postmysis stages of the giant tiger prawn, Penaeus monodon are described and illustrated using laboratory-reared specimens and wild ones. The first 3 or 4 substages are termed "megalopa" owing to the incomplete branchial formula of the mouth parts, their pelagic or planktonic behavior and their somewhat narrower body. At the 4th or 5th substage, the branchial formula is completed, their behavior is more or less epibenthic, the chromatophores are densely distributed from the tip of the antennular flagella through the ventral side of the abdomen to the tip of the telson. At the beginning of the 7th substage, the chromatophores are distributed over almost the whole body. Thus from the 4th or 5th substage onwards they may be termed juveniles. The main characteristics development are as follows : 1) The cempletion of the rostral spine formula appears in the 7th or 8th substage showing 7 dorsal and 3 ventral spines. 2) The endopod of the 1st maxilliped develops again at the 7th substage, although it degenerates with every molt prior to the 7th. 3) From the 1st substage, the distal 3 segments of the endopod of the 2nd maxilliped are bent sharply inwards.

N2  - Two egg-carrying females of Pilumnopeus iudicus (De MAN) were collected near the tide marks of rocky shore around Omaezaki, Shizuoka Pref., in June, 1979. Larvae were reared from hatching to megalopa stage under temperature conditions varying from 23.5℃ to 24.5℃. Zoea follows four stages before changing into megalopa stage. Each zoeal stage is figured and described in detail, and compared with equivalent stage of several species belonging to the subfamily Pilumninae. The zoeae of this species can be distinguished from those of the other Pilumnids by having a minute rostral and a dorsal spines on the carapace, and the antenna II of the type A_3 (AIKAWA, 1929, 1933).

N2  - The present paper deals with the results of observatons of zoeal development of the subfamilies Iliinae and Leucosiinae (family Leucosiidae), using the following five species as materials : Arcania undecimspinosa elongata YOKOYA, Myra fugax FABRIClUS, Philyra syndactyla ORTMANN, Philyra pisumde HAAN, and Leucosia longifrons de HAAN. The general features of these species are, (a) antenna II and telson fall in types D and E respectively (AIKAWA 1929) , (b) endodop of maxilliped I has setae arranged as 4・1-2-1-2-2, (c) setation on protopod of maxilliped II is 1・1・1・1(4), (d) exopods of maxillipeds bear 6 natatory setae in stages II and III, (e) a pair of lateral knobs are found on abdominal somites II and III, and (f) articulation of telson is not can be found through all stages. The differences between the two subfamilies may be seen in the zoeal stages ; armature of maxilla I and II, and length of three pairs of inner setae on caudal furcae. Specific defferences in the characters of zoeae are as follows : carapace of Philyra pisum has a rostral spine, no dorsal and lateral spines, that of Philyra syndactyla has rostral and dorsal spines, but other species have these three kinds of spines. In Arcania undecimspinosa elongata, protopod of maxilliped I lacks chromatophore which is found in other species. Endopod of maxillipede II of Myra fugax consists of two-segments in stages I and II, whereas other four species have one or two-segments in all stages. Leucosia longifrons has the setation of 2・3・2・1(8) on protopod of maxilliped I, while other species have 2・2・2・2(8) setation respectively.

N2  - A peculiar feeding habit of opening mollusk shells was observed in Calappa gallus capellonis LAURIE in the field (Murote Bay faced to the Bungo Channel) and in the laboratory (Ehime University). It is sure that the box crabs can skillfully open the shells by using the tubercles of the right chela and thus feed on the soft parts or hermit crabs. The shell-opening mechanism observed is not basically different from the result reported by SHOUP (1968). When there are no shells in the surrounding, the box crabs take the other foods.

N2  - An ovigerous female of Pinnotheres pholadis de HAAN was obtained from the mantle cavity of a common mussel, Mytilus edulis Linnaeus at Nojima coast, south-western part of Tokyo Bay, in September, 1977. The female pea-crab was kept in a glass rearing vessel filled fresh sea water, until the larvae were hatched. The first zoeae were kept in a small glass vessel. They were fed on freshly hatched Artemia nauplii. Unfortunately, the larvae did not moult into more advanced stages. The first zoea of this species is unique in having rostral and lateral spines as compared with that of four Japanese species, P. sp., P. latissimus, P. sinensis and P. boninensis.

N2  - Trachypenaeus villaluzi a new species of penaeid prawn from the Philippines is described in detail and compared with the related species. The new species is characterized by the following features : Mastigobranchia are present on the 2nd and 3rd pereiopods, but absent on the first ; anterior plate of thelycum is deeply concave ; the lower margin of the distolateral projections of the petasma is concave. It is also suggested that Trachypenaeus asper ALCOCK Should be considered as a valid species instead of being treated as a synonym of T. curvirostris (STIMPSON).

N2  - A new species of penaeid prawn, Penaeus silasi from North Borneo is described in detail and compared with the closely related species such as P. indicus, P. merguiensis and P. penicillatus. The new species is characterized by the following features : The 3rd maxilliped of the adult male has a dactylus as long as or slightly shorter than the propodus which has only a rudimentary tuft of hair instead of a long tuft of bristles as in P. indicus; the anterior plate of the thelycum is triangular and relatively prominent.

N2  - 1. The pictures taken by the photosled in 13 lowerings in the upwelling area off NW-Africa and off Morocco show 13 species of Decapoda Reptantia and Stomatopoda. Only specimens which could be identified to generic level at least are dealt with and all others that can only be ranged in higher taxa (above generic level) are ecluded from consideration. 2. The perceptibility-limit of specimens is about 2-3cm carapace breadth. 3. Most of the photographed species could also be obtained by trawls. 4. The photosled is shortly described with special regard to improvements. It is a useful tool for biological mapping of the sea floor.

N2  - Recently a good dried specimen of American Lobster, Homarus americanus is placed on show in a corner of the first floor of the Matsue Branch of the Central Bank for Agriculture and Forestry. This lobster was caught 250 sea miles off the coast of New York City by a crew of the Okuni-maru, a pelagic fishing vessel of Japan in January, 1974. The specimen is generally yellow-reddish brown coloured over the entire body, and measured 48cm from the tip of rostrum to the posterior margin of telson. The carapace is 27cm long including rostrum, and 21.5cm excluding rostrum, with the width of 15cm. The two spines furnished on the under-surface of the rostrum, the characteristic of the species, are of anomalous shape as follows: knitted together at the bases and expanded like a roundish plate as shown in the Text-fig. 2, B.

N2  - During his journey from March to June of 1976, Dr. Tetsushi Senta, the head of the Fisheries Experiment Station attached to the Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University, investigated the milkfish of the Philippine Islands. While in N. W. Luzon Island he saw by chance an edible fresh-water prawn from Paoay Lake, boiled plain in a restaurant at the town of Batac; then he visited the Lake near the town and obtained one of that type of prawn from a fisherman. According to Dr, Senta it is caught in a small fish trap composed of a split bamboo fence, placed in the shallow waters (about 1m. deep) on the Lake at night. As the result of the present writer's examination of the said collection (5♂♂, 2♀♀), the formulae of the rostrum teeth (Table 1) and the character of fingers of the second hand (Text-fig. 4, C) of the adult male who's body length is 58mm., agree well with Dana's original description and Cowles' detailed observation of Palaemon lanceifrons (=Macrobrachium lanceifrons lanceifrons) from the neighbourhood of Manila. The teeth of rostrum range along its whole upper margin at varied intervals. The second hand is not slender than the carpus. The eggs borne by 43mm. long mother prawn are subglobular in shape, and about 0.95mm. long and 0.85mm. broad, which is a little larger in size than that used in Cowles' data.

N2  - This paper is the outcome of a survey of Cladocera fauna of Bhagalpur (India). The number of species recorded were eleven from among five genera. All the species recorded in this paper are new record for Bihar, except Moina dubia GUERENE & RICHARD and Ceriodaphnia rigaudi RICHARD. Regarding the zoogegraphical disrtibution of the cladocera of Bhagalpur, India it appears that it has greater affinity with South-East Asian, Australian and African fauna than the Palaeartic fauna.

N2  - There have been none report of dogielinotid Amphipoda on the coast of Japan. The family were recorded from the USSR coast of the Japan Sea and Okhotsk Sea, and also reported from northern California. The author collected some gammarids on sandy beach at Hakodate, in Japan, and found some Haustorioides (Dogielinotidae) in the collection. Though H. munsterhjermi only was described hitherto by OLDEVIG and J. L. BARNARD in this genus, the author's specimen is defferent from Oldevig's one in some morphological characteristics. It differs in the number of articlates of 2nd antenna, the shape of 5th articlate of 3rd peraeopod, the setae type of dactylus of 3-4th pereopods, the tooth size of pleonal epimera 1-3, and the telson form. Therefore, I wish to describe as H. sp. herein, to proceed with the ecological studies until they were concluded by authoritative taxonomist.

No articulation can be seen. The anterior portion of this arm is similar to that of the normal propodus in shape. (2) The malformation of the right third leg; on the base of the carpus, there are two regenerated fingers which are forming propodus and dactylus with articulations respectively. Each regenerated finger is shorter than the normal one in length.

The present species bears a few eggs of large size, and the eggs hatch out as non・pelagic larvae of benthic habit. The newly-hatched larvae have the stalked eyes and all the appendages of adult form but uropods, although some zoeal characters are still remained.

Gecarcoidea lalandii is known up to now only from the souther-most islands. The occurrence of Cardisoma rotundum is restricted to high rocky islands. C. carnifex and C. hirtipes occur as far north as Amami-Oshima. 3: The distribution border is apparently formed by the 20°C-Isotherme of sea-water in February, so that both species are expected to occur on Tokara-Gunto, too.

N2  - The Board of the Crown Prince's Household of Japan was kind enough to send the author 13 living specimens of the Hawaiian fresh-water shrimps for his study, in February, 1975. According to the information from the Board, their localities are unknown in detail. As the result of the author's examination of those shrimps, it is found that 12 specimens belong to Caridina acuminata which has been reported from Bonin Islands (STIMPSON, 1890) and Ito, Sagami Bay, Japan (BALSS, 1914), and that 1 specimen, to Macrobrachium lar distributed ,widely throughout the Indo-West Pacific region from E. Africa to the Riukiu Islands, Micronesia and Marquesas Island. Their body-length excluding rostrum : the former specimens are 14.5, 15, 16, 17mm respectively in female and 13.5mm in male, and the latter, very young male, 24mm. So far as the author knows both the said species have not hitherto been recorded from the Hawaii Islands. The colouration of C. acuminata is Characteristic as follows : marked with many dark brown coloured spots which being arranged longitudinally in two rows over the lateral surface of the abdomen. The upper row is variable to the streak. The dactylus of the fifth leg is furnished with 8 to 15 bristles on the posterior margin.

N2  - In this introductory report on the crabs of the Ogasawara Islands altogether 123 species of 12 families were enumerated on the authorities of the previous workers. They are 2 species of the family Dromiidae, 4 of the Calappidae, 1 of the Hymenosomatidae, 13 of the Majidae, 5 of the Parthenopidae, 6 of the Portunidae, 63 of the Xanthidae, 2 of the Goneplacidae, I of the Pinnotheridae, 6 of the Ocypodidae, 18 of the Grapsidae, and 2 of the Gecarcinidae. Even if the identifications may be not always correct in some xanthid and other species, the monumental records are worthy as the indicators of the Ogasawara Islands crabs unless there are no definite reasons to reject the names. Most of the species are widely distributed in the southern Indo-West Pacific waters, differing as a whole from the crab fauna of the Japanese mainland.

N2  - This paper deals with the decapod crustaceans obtained from the stomachs of four species of fishes collected at the rocky bottom of the shallow water. The fish species are Epinephelus fasciatus (FORSSKAL) of the Serranidae, Gymnocranius japonicus AKAZAKI and Lethrinus variegatus VALENCIENNES Of the Lethrinidae, and Parupeneus barberinoides (BLEEKER) of the Mullidae. All the species are useful for food, and the first or the blacktip rockcod is the most abundant along the entire coasts of the islands and islets of the Ogasawara Islands. Among these only in the second species three specimens are available for the examination of the stomach contents. The identification of the species is rather difficult in some cases in which there are only the fragments of the carapace and chelipeds. In this paper altogether 20 crab species including some questionable ones were identified, and two pairs of chelae obtained from G. japonicus, which are probably referred to those of Lissocarcinus or allied genera of the Portunidae, are remained uncertain. There are otherwise a large and a small chelae of snapping shrimp referable to Alpheus, a chela of Callianassa which is an anomuran decapod called mud or ghost shrimp, two specimens of Munida or lobster krill, a right or small cheliped of hermit crab referable to Calcinus, and two specimens of grapsid megalopa larvae. Although 123 crab species have hitherto been known from the Ogasawara Islands, it is remarkable that 11 of 20 species identified at present are new to this area. This fact indicates that the rocky bottom of the shallow or rather deep water is scarcely exploited. This sort of reports may be therefore of certain use not only for the systematics of the crustaceans, but also as the indicators for the ecology of the fishes and crustaceans. As summarized in Table 1, it is remarkable that 7 of 20 species are referable to the Majidae, representing 35% of the species recorded. The families subjected to food of fishes are the Dromiidae, Majidae, Parthenopidae, Portunidae, Xanthidae, Goneplacidae, so that the ratio of the known species of the Majidae among these families are only 14%. On the other hand, the low percentage of the Xanthidae for food is also remarkable, being 30% at present contrary to 69% in the known species of the above families. This fact may be attributed to the different habit and habitat, and it is briefiy mentioned that the camouflage with the seaweed, sponge or other inorganic matter may be not always an effective means for the defence against the fishes. The relation between the crab and fish species is summarized in Table 2. This suggests that as for the habit of food search Parupenus barberiwoides may be somewhat different from Gymnocranius japonicus and Epinephelus fasciatus.

N2  - 1) The larval development of the subfamily Sesarminae, the land crabs, has been studied from the first zoea to megalopa, using the following four species as materials : Sesarma (Sesarma) intermedia, Sesarma (Parasesarma) erythrodactyla, Sesarma (Chiromantes) bidens and Cyclograpsus intermedius. 2) In order to clarify the specific differences of the larvae in this subfamily, several comparisons have been made among these four species as well as with other five species, the developments of which were reported in one of the auther's previous papers (1974) : Sesarma (Parasesarma) picta, Sesarma (Holometopus) haematocheir, Sesarma (Holometopus) dehaani, Helice tridens tridens and Chasmagnathus canvexus. 3) The number of zoea stages comprised in entire course of development differs according to genera, this being four in S. (H.) dehaani, S. (P.) picta, S. (P.) erythrodactyla, S. (C.) bidens, Chasmagnathus convexus and five in the others. 4) Of the characters which are constant through all the stages of zoea, the followings are found common to all the examined species of the subfamily: (a) The arrangement of setae on some of the limbs: the endopod of the maxilla I, 4.1(5)-1; the protopod of the maxillipede I, 3.3.2.2(10); the same of the maxillipede II, 1.1.1.1(4); the endopod of the maxillipede II, 3.3(6)-1-0; (b) The maxillipede I has a chromatophore on the protopod. (c) The telson belongs to A_0-type. 5) Of the characters which are constant through all the zoea stages, the followings are different according to genera. (a) The lateral spines of carapace which are present in Helice and Chasmagnathus are absent from Sesarma and Cyclograpsus. (b) The arrangement of setae on the endopod of the maxilla II is 3.2(5) in Sesarma, whereas 2.2(4) in the others. (c) In Cyclograpsus, the protopod of the maxillipede II has chromatophores which are absent in the others. (d) Helice and Chasmagnathus carry lateral spines on the pleomere IV, but Sesarma and Cyclograpsus are lacking in these. 6) Of the characters which undergo changes as the development progresses, the following are common to all the species examined : (a) Judging from the first stage of the development, the endopod rudiment of the antenna II, pereiopods and pleopods are more or less uniform in their growth rate through all the species. (b) In the zoea stage II, a plumose seta appears on the basis of the maxilla I on outer side to persist through subsequent stages. (c) The maxilla II has a feebly bifurcate basis, and the setae are arranged as 4.5(9) in the first two stages. (d) The maxillipede I has setae as 4.1(5)-2-1-2-2 on the endopod in the first two stages. (e) Natatory setae on expods of the maxillipedes I and II increase in their number after a formula : 2×(S+1), where S is the ordinal number of stages. (f) The articulation of the telson becomes distinct in the zoea III. (g) The endopod rudiment of antenna I becomes distinct in the final stage of zoea in Helice, Chasmagnathus, and Cyclograpsus, but it does not exist even in this stage in Sesarma. (h) In the scaphognathite of the maxilla II of Sesarma, the plumose, setae increase with the stages as follows : zoea I, 4.1(5), zoea II, 5.3(8), and zoea III, 7.4(11). (i) Only in Sesarma, the telson is armed with six setae between the caudal furcae through all the stages. 7) Features of megalopa common to all the nine species of Sesarminae are as follows: (a) The maxillipede II has one outer seta on the exopod segment I. (b) The maxillipede III has one seta on the exopod segment I. (c) The pleopod IV lacks plumose setae on the coxa. (d) The uropod which bears one seta on the coxa lacks endopod in all the members of Sesarminae. 8) Generic differences in the characters of megalopa are as follows : In Sesarma, the antenna I lacks the endopod, the mandibular palp bears four setae in the distal segment, the maxillipede I carries three plumose setae on the proximal exopod segment along the outer border, and the uropod is furnished with six plumose setae on the lateral margin of the exopod. In the other genera, the antenna I has an endopod, and the mandibular palp, exoped of the maxillipede I and exopod of the uropod have setae in eight, two and ten respectively.

N2  - The writers found recentry many nodulose tubes from the basal part of the upper Narita formation (late plistocene) at the east corner of Shimoyokoto village, Yokoto-Machi, Chiba-city, Chiba prefecture. The tubes consist of mud and sand mixture, some one is preserved in good condition and remains callianassid crustacea (Callianassa japonica ORTMAN) in it. These specimens had been kept of nearly in living position, that is, they have large and small chelipeds in pairs and fragile jointed waking appendages. On the other hand, the remains which were found outside of the tubes had been polished and detached by water current and some of them has small holes on the surface which probably been challenged by scavenger or certain carnivorous animals. This finding suggest, more or less, post-mortem changes. In short, the writers are strongly inclined to consider that the good preserved individuals in tubes might have been autochthonous fossils, and the others died outside of original burrows.

N2  - The anomuran crab, Lithodes longispina SAKAI (Fig. 1), is a species allied to Lithodes turritus and L. aequispina. This crab has been taken from the bottoms, 400-900m deep, off Boso Peninsula and Sagami Bay from March 1969 to March 1971 (Fig. 2, Table 1). Width of carapace ranges from 9.3 to 12.5 cm in the female and from 9.4 to 13.5 cm in the male (Fig. 3). The spawning period of this crab seems to continue from August to October (Fig. 4). The number of incubating eggs was correlated to the carapace width of the crab at the coefficy of correlation, 0.859. The number of eggs ranges from 3,900 to 11,200 per individual female from 9.8 cm to 11.9 cm in carapace width (Fig. 5).

N2  - This paper deals with the anandromous phenomena of megalopa of Varuna litterata (FABRICIUS) (Grapsidae, Varuninae), which was observed at the river mouth of the Hikiji-Gawa, situated on the north-east coast of Sagami Bay. The phenomena were observed in the daytime during the period from Oct. 9th to Nov. 7th of 1972. Tidal influence to the river reaches about 2 km from the river mouth. The adult crab is very rarely found on the northern areas of Sagami Bay, where may be the northern limit of distribution of this species. Each of the megalopa reaches the river mouth from off shore before full tide. The number of megalopa increases to the greatest at the time of full tide after the new moon or the full moon day. The megalopa continues to swim swiftly up the stream, keeping the distance between 10 to 30 cm from the shore. The swarm of megalopae thus reaches even 2 km beyond the limit of tidal influence. The length of carapace of the megalopa varies from 3.7 mm to 4.5 mm, the average size being 4.1 mm.

N2  - Eriocheir japonica mates during the period from the middle of October to the latter part of March and the peak of mating period is from the middle of January to that of February. The mating occus in the inter tidal zone of the neap tide. This crabs usually chose a region nearer the full tide line as a mating place. The mating time is during the tide rising. The crabs showing sexual behavior are more than 3.9cm in carapace width and the smaller crabs which are less than 3.9 cm in carapace width passes the winter in the river. This species changes its nature a few days after having reached the tidal zone and losts its nocternal disposition and comes to behave to the rhythum of an ebb and flow even in the day time. The crabs chose the partners by snipping one another. The opposite sex is recognizd by the degree of the intensity of snipping back. The male crabs living in the river have the second pleopods, but lost them when these crabs come down to the tidal zone for mating. In the laboratory the mating behavior of Eriocheir japonica easily can be observed, by keeping the male and female crabs obtained from the inter tidal zone in aquariums separately, in which 25-30 % sea water is preserved about a week befor pairing. The mating occurs in 25-30 % sea water, in pure sea water and also in fresh water.

N2  - The present author obtained three living specimens of megalopa from Sagami Bay by surface collection, in October of 1970. These larvae have been reared in the aquarium until moulted to the young crabs, which are identified to Hemigrapsus penicillatus. The adult crab is very common in japan, found usually on the rocky and muddy beaches as well as on the beach of pebbles on river-mouth. The larval features of these specimens have been observed and illustrated in this short report, comparing with the larvae of some other related crabs already reported.

N2  - The larvae of Chasmagnathus convexus reared in the laboratory were obtained from tow ovigerous crabs collected in Ise Bay in April 1972 and fed Artemia nauplii. This species consists of four zoeal stages and one megalopa stage in the complete development. Twenty eight days were taken until the young crab metamorphosed. 1. The zoea stage. The carapace is 0.6 mm in length. It possesses a rostral and a dorsal spine, and a pair of lateral spines on the carapace. The abdomen is composed of six distinct segments. There are a pair of lateral knobs on either side of the second segment, and the same little paired spines on the third and the fourth segment. The paired larval appendages; antennae, mandible, maxillae and maxillipeds, are observed. Numbers of black chromatophores are seen on the surface of the body, and a few pale yellowish green chromatophores only on the abdomen. The additional changes in number are found through the four zoeal stages in following parts: (1) Swimming hairs of the first and the second maxillipeds, (2) segments of the abdomen. (3) setae on the telson, (4) setae on the coxopodite, the basipodite and the scaphognathite of the maxillae, (5) aesthetes on the top of the first antenna, (6) chromatophores. In the second or the third zoeal stage, the rudiments of five parts of the megalopa stage; (1) endopodite of the second antenna, (2) pereiopod, (3) pleopod, (4) third maxilliped, (5) gill can be observed. They are develop in length in the fourth zoeal stage. 2. The megalopa stage The carapace is 1.7 mm in length, 1.4 mm in width, and is in good shape. The dorsal surface of the carapace is smooth and bald. The front bears four appendixes with round tops. The short rostral spine is projecting downwards. The dactylus of the fourth ambulatory leg bears three long feelers at the distal portion. The abdomen is divided into seven distinct segments. The seventh segment is rectangular and its posterior margin swells out, with one point emarginating on its central portion 3. The first young crab stage The general aspect of the body is similar to that of the adult crab. The carapace is 3.5 mm in length and 3.3 mm in width. Many black chromatophores arid pale yellowish green ones are observed on the surface of the carapace and the ambulatory legs.

N2  - The paleo-ecological method of studies for the fossil barnacles collected from the Narita formation of Japan proper is discussed in this paper, referring to the ecological information of barnacles in a living state. The fossil barnacles obtained from the pleistocene beds keep well-defined coloring on the shell plates. Typical hosts of the fossil barnacles are pelecypode species. In the case that the fossil barnacles had been removed from certain hosts, the original hosts are possible to presume by the ornamentati on printing the fossil barnacle bases. It is known that the shell plates of barnacles in a living state are almost attacked with boring algae (Parke & Moore, 1935). The same evidences are also founded in the barnacles obtained from various pleistocene beds at the Narita formation.

N2  - Daphnia from five lakes on Vancouver Island in British Columbia are reasonably classifiable as three different species. D. pulex Leydig, D. rosea G. O. Sars and D. thordta Forbes. The individuals of all the populations have, however, not only some typical appearance of each respective species, but also have some characteristics of two species in various degrees, probably due to introgressive hybridization. From this point of view their characteristics are discussed, suggesting possible hybridization between D. pulex and D. middendorffiana, between D. rosea and D. middendorffiana, and between D. thorata and D. rosea. The writer can make no further comments on the real nature of these interspecific forms than only to give their characteristics.

N2  - Three developmental stages of Caprella equilibra Say have been studies - a young of 10 mm in body length, a semi-adult of 12mm and a full-grown of 22mm. In the young, the second antenna is longer than the peduncle of the first antenna, and in the fully grown, it is about 1/2 or 1/3 the length of the first antenna. This difference probabiy due to unusual growth of the second and third segments of the first antenna. The flagellum of the first antenna is consisted of 10 joints in the young, of 12 in the semi adult and of 18 in the fully grown. As she animal grows, the first and second segments grow excessively, so that the first segment attains almost twice as long as the third segment, and the second almost thrice the third. Lateral spines are growing in second, third, fourth and fifth segments. As the animal grows, the ratio between the length of hand and the whole body length decreases, but that between palmar tooth and palmar poison tooth increases. Such differences are peculiar to the aged individual of this species.

N2  - A new locality is found from Japan on the crab, Lithodes aequispina Benedict (1894). This crab has been taken from waters, 450〜740m in depth, off Shioyazaki, Fukushima Prefecture. The crab in question is characterized by the rostrum, which is armed with 9 (Fig. 1B) or 10 spines. Sometimes 3 spines are found on the dorsal surface of the rostrum, when the spines of the rostrum enumerate 10 spines in total number. The carapace furnished with 111〜161 acute short spines (Fig. 1A). This spines have a trend decreasing in number with growth. An individual, 85mm in carapace length, bears 161 spines, that, 112mm long, has 136 spines, and that, 160mm long, has 111 ones. In adult form, the width of the carapace is larger than the length of the carapace. This inclination seems to be a little more salient in male than in female as shown in the Table 1. The egg of this crab is comparatively lager, measuring ca. 1.1mm in longer diameter, ca. 0.9mm in shorter one. Fishery of this crab, in Iwaki city, Fukushima Pref., takes place during the months from December to September. Vigorous season ranges from January to March. Some females taken in March are found bearing eggs beneath abdomen. This crab is fished by using a cage about 45cm and 120cm in diameter of the mouth and the bottom respectively, about 58cm in height. Some fishes, such as scomber, saury, sardine, anchovy, and others are used for the bait.

N2  - The author reviewed his former studies on the minute structures of fossils in Japan. Minute structures of carapace in some recent and fossil crabs are investigated in this paper, based upon the photographs of electron-microscope. Carcinoplax longimanus-the recent species shows the horizontal and inclined structures in the section of carapace, in which a canal system may be found. The diameter of the canals is ranging from 1 to 3 microns. Cancer minutoserratus from the Tatsunokuchi formation in Sendai shows the assemblages of polygons with linear structure, in the surface of carapace. Carcinoplax prisca from the Miocene formation of Miyazaki Prefecture shows sub-rounded polygonal assemblages on the surface of the carapace. Notopocorystes stokesii from the Cretaceous Greensand of Cambridge shows rounded polygonal assemblages on the surface of carapace. It seems that fossil crabs have the tendency of orthogenetic evolution from the rounded polygonal assemblages in the minute structure of the surface of carapace to the angular ones, but the mutual relation of the minute structure of carapace in the recent species between the surface and the section is not yet clear. In future, it is most necessary to observe the sections of carapace of fossil crabs by electron microscope, and subsequently to study the relation between micro-structures of inorganic materials of carapace and organic materials in fossil crabs.

N2  - This paper deals with the sacculinization occurred in a male of the pea crab, Pinnetheres sinensis Shen. The specimen was found living commensally within the mantle cavity of the common bivalved shell, Mytilus edulis Linne, obtained on the coast of Tokyo Bay in October, 1964. The body of the adult normal male of Pinnotheres sinensis is rather flat and solid, much smaller than the normal female which has the grobular and soft-shelled body. Even in the largest male, the length of carapace is less than one half that of the fully grown female. In the male, the chela is somewhat thickset compared with that of the female and its propodus furnished with 10-13 setae near the distal end of the anterior border. In second and third pairs of the male ambulatory legs, the carapus is crossed by an oblique row of long feathered hairs, and the propodus fringed with same hairs along the anterior borders. The dactylus of all pairs is claw-shaped and shorter than the propodus. In the female, the dactylus of the last ambulatory leg is rod-shaped and longer than the propodus, furnished with longish hairs along the inner border, with short hairs around the whole surface in distal half. The width of the male abdomen is much narrower than that of the female-about one fifth the length of the carapace, and its sixth abdominal segment has a hook-shaped process on the lateral margin. Of the two pairs of male pleopods, the posterior one has a short flatty exopodite. Of the four pairs of female pleopods, the posterior two are uniramous and has no exopodite (Fig. 1). The external morphological modifications are seen in the male, by sacculinization, as shown in the following: a) The size of the body becomes comparatively larger than in the normal male, and its exoskeleton becomes softend as in the female body (P1. VI). B) The chela becomes somewhat slender and the setae on the propodus are replaced by soft longish hairs, covering the distal surface of both fingers (Fig. 2, 3). C) The long feathered hairs seen on the second and third ambulatory legs are worn out and the dactylus of the fourth ambulatory leg is longer than the propodus, furnished with long hairs as seen in the female (Fig. 2, 1). D) The width of abdomen is broadened; the lateral margin of the sixth segment becomes entire and with marginal hairs (Fig. 3). E) No change of form seems to occur in the first pleopod except for its tip. The carified bridge at the foot of the first pleopod is rudimented. The exopodite of the second pleopod is well developed and covered with long soft hairs. No pleopod is seen in the third abdominal segment, while in the fourth abdominal segment, a uniramous appendage is seen on the right side (Fig. 3 and 4). The internal morphological modifications are seen in testis and midgut gland. These organs are entirely rudimented, being only represented by withered cells. The roots of the parasite glowing thickly around the vas deferens, the midgut gland, the anterior portion of intestine, and the thoracic ganglion. In vas deferens, however, sperms and spermatophores are still seen filling the duct. The penetration of roots of the parasite into the thoracic ganglion has already been investigated by the previous authors (MATSUMOTO K. (1952) and HOSHINO K. (1962)), so the author's present investigation is confined to that of the vas deferens.

N2  - Two megalopa larvae of Percnon planissimum (Herbst) were obtained on the coasts of Hayama, Sagami Bay (Sep., 1964) and Hachijo Island (Aug., 1966), and reared in the aquarium until they reach the first crab stage. Megalopa stage: (The carapace 5mm in length, 3.8mm in width.) The carapace has no dorsal spine. The dorsal surface of carapace is thickly covered with a fine tomentum. The rostrum is horizontally projecting forwards. The postero-lateral portion of the carapace is somewhat swollen. The flagellum of second antenna has ten segments and its distal segment is furnished with a short hair and two long ones. In the third maxilliped the endopodite has the distal five segments setose and its exopodite one-segmeted and about half as long as the ishium. The dactylus of the fourth ambulatory legs is provided with two long feelers at the distal end. The second to fifth abdominal segments are respectively provided with a pair of biramous pleopods. There are 33〜44 swimming hairs on the lateral margin of the exopodite of pleopods. The small hooks are growing along the inner margin of the endopodite of pleopods. The sixth abdominal segment is provided with a pair of uropods, which are rather smaller in size, bearing 25〜26 swimming hairs on the lateral margin. The number of segments of exopodite and that of swimming hairs are compared with those of the megalopa of Plagusia dentipes and Plagusia depressa tuberculata in Table I. First crab-stage: (The carapace 5.5mm in length, 5mm in width.) The aspect of the body approaches that of the adult crab. The carapace is slightly larger than that of the megalopa. In the first crab-stage, the abdomen has seven distinct segments, while in the next stage (carapace 8mm in length, and 8mm in width), the third to fifth abdominal segments are almost coalescent with each other as in the adult crab.

N2  - 1. The present paper deals with the carcinological fauna of the Izu-Ohshima and adjacent islands (shown in text-figures 1〜2) during the years 1954〜1965. 2. The specimens of crabs hitherto idetified number 130 species referable to 78 genera and 16 families as shown in table 1. Biogeographycally, the authors divided these specieis into 7 routes, after the view of Sakai (1940, 1. C.). [table] 3. The new northern limit of the tropical species number 22, including three noteworthy species, which have hitherto been recorded from distant southern localities such as Bonin Island, Northern Daitojima and Loo Choo. 4. The features of the fauna of these islands generally resembling those of the southern Japan; some species to have extended from the Hachijo Island, but the most show more tropical or subtropical aspects than in the adjacent districts of the Japanese mainlands. 5. Izu-Ohshima is a volcanic island and is surrounded by rock beaches but we could obtain 3 species of the sand crab--Ocypoda stimpsoni, O. cordimana and Scopimera globosa; no typical esturine areas, but could obtain Eriocheir japonicus and Sesarma (Holometopus) haematocheir; and only a few fresh water streams but Potamon (Geothelphusa) dehaani is not uncommon. 6. Seven species enumerated below are rare in Japanese carcinological fauna, -Lasiodromia coppingeri unidentata, Achaeopsis rostrata, Platymaja myville-thomsoni, Ovalipes iridescens, Charybdis orientaris, Lybia tessellata and Geograpsus crinipes.

N2  - The changes of the cheliped following the growth of the carapace were studied on the Carcinoplax longimanus (DE HAAN) which were collected by trawlnets and dredges in the East China Sea during these twelve years from October 1953 to July 1964, and the following results were obtained. The dimensions measured for the present study are shown in Fig. 1. Carapace length: Length from the frontal margin to the posterior margin of the carapace. Carapace width: Width from the left margin to the right margin of the carapace. Palm length: Length from the tip of the immovable finger of the cheliped to the boundary between the cheliped and the carpus. Merus length: Length from the boundary between the carpus and the merus to the boundary between the merus and the ischium. 1) The relative growth of the width of the carapace on the length of the carapace is shown in Fig. 4 (female) and Fig. 5 (male). A linear regression is fit in female, but an inflection is shown at about 50mm in carapace length in male. 2) The relative growth of the length of the merus of the cheliped on the length of the palm represents good fit to linear regression in female (Fig. 6) and male (Fig. 7). 3) The relative growth of the length of the palm and the merus of the cheliped on the length of the carapace is shown as linear regression in female (Figs. 8 and 10), but a distinct inflection is noted at about 40 to 45mm in carapace length in male (Figs. 9 and 11). 4) Rapid growth of the cheliped after the growth inflection at about 40 to 45mm in carapace length in male seems to be related with the increasing of the copulation function.

N2  - Following four species, namely, Pandalus hypsinotus BRANDT, P. borealis KROYER, P. goniurus STIMPSON, Pandalopsis dispar RATHBUN, are found as shrimp resources of the Bering Sea. In P. borealis, the most important shrimp resources in the sea in question, the body-length, from postorbital margin to tip of telson, ranges 72.0〜120.0 mm in female, 41.5〜98.0 mm in male. It seems that the sexual change of this shrimp takes place in body-length from 70 mm to 100 mm. Spawned shrimps, pre-eyed egg, eyed egg-arrying ones and those having ovarian eggs occur during the period from posterior half of April to September. Egg diameter is measured 1.02×0.78 mm in pre-eyed eggs, 1.43-0.96 mm in eyed eggs. Number of eggs laid beneath abdomen has a positive relation with body-length. It is 425-2045 (1207 on average) in eyed-egg, 724-2606 (1776 on average) in pre eyed one.

N2  - A number of specimens of Hexapus sexpes (Fabricius) have been obtained by the writer from the waste of the trawl-net in Mikawa District, Aichi Prefecture. These speimens are enormous in size compared with those hitherto recorded by the previous authors (cf. page 49). The biggest female specimen measured 19.5 mm in the length of carapace and 33.0 mm in the width of same. According to Dr. T. SAKAI, such big specimens of Hexapus sexpes are not uncommon in Suruga Bay (off Numazu City) and Sagami Bay (off Enoshima). The literatures and references of this species, as well as the congeners are enumerated in the Japanese text of this paper.

N2  - Lernaea elegans LEIGH-SHARPE, which is a commonly Japanese parasitic copepoda, known as "anchor worm", is found in the skin of Oryzias latipes (TEMMINCK et SCHLEGEL) -one of the commonenest fresh-water fish in Japan. In natural condition, it looks like a small yellowish green straw sticking into the skin of the host. The anchor-like horns of the cephalothorax penetrate into the muscle through the integument of the host. They sometimes reach to the pericardial or peritoneal cavities. The infected portions of the host are red from blood that continually oozed out and often growing into a gall. This paper deals with a histological study of the infected portions of the host and the life cycle of the parasite.

N2  - An interesting habit in some of the younger fish belonging to the Suborder Stromateina, that accompanying the jellyfish, is well known as an example of commensalism. In the young crab such habit as mentioned above, has not yet been known. On October 5, 1962, two individuals of jellyfish, Rhopilema esculenta KISHINOUYE, were obtained off the coast of Enoshima in Sagami Bay and were reared in an inspection tank of the Enoshima Aquarium in Kanagawa Prefecture. They were consecutively bred till October 22, and the attention of the author was attracted to one of the specimens which was accompanied with two small crabs. The small crab was identified as a juvenile male of Charybdis cruciata (HERBST), measuring 9.7 mm in carapace length and 12.9 mm in carapace width. The life history of Charybdis cruciata, is unknown at present, but it seems to be similar to that of the related species, Charybdis japonica A. M.-EDWARDS. In most of the Brachyuran carbs, the habitat and habit of the yonnger stage -Megalopa and early crab-stage- are gradually corresponding to those of the adult in the course ot the development. It is noteworthy that the young of Ch. Cruciata has been found living among the oral arms of the jellyfish, however, whether this fact is due to commensalism or to a mere accident is not certain to conclude at present. The author regards, however, the ecological terminology "exploitation" may be properly applied for the present case.

N2  - Two living specimens of megalopa of P. depressa tuberculata LAMARCK were obtained at the coast of Manazuru, Sagami Bay, in early autumn of 1963 and also in early summer of 1964, and were reared in the aquarium until they reach the first crab stage. These specimens have been compared with those of P. dentipes DE HAAN. The data is summarized in the following. The megalopa stage: a) The carapace is sparingly covered with a fine tomentum, whereas, it is naked P. dentipes. B) The rostrum is well projecting forwards and bified at the tip, whereas, it is rather short and broadly bilobed in P. dentipes. C) The exopod of the external maxilliped is composed of one segment, it is two-segmented in P. dentipes. D) The difference in number of plumose setae in the exopod of the last pleopod between these two species is shown in table 1. The first crab-stage: Aside from the various morphological points of difference between the young crabs of the two species, the carapace of P. depressa tuberculata is covered with tubercles and short hairs, whereas, it is not tuberculated but only haired in P. dentipes.

N2  - Inquiries have been made into the ranges of crabs found in the estuaries of the southern Kanto district (Tokyo Metropolis and Kanagawa Prefecture). Only a few number of species may be seen in the river mouth of the torrential rivers such as, Hayakawa, Sakawagawa, Hanamizugawa and Sagamigawa. They are Varuna litterata, Eriocheir japonicus, Sesarma haematocheir, S. dehaani and S. intermedia all belonging to estuarine crabs. On the other hand, in the estuaries of the slowly flowing rivers such as, Sakaigawa, Namerigawa, Tagoegawa, Moritogawa, Hirasakugawa, Tamagawa and Arakawa, som marine crabs such as, Philyra pisum, Charybdis japonicus and Hemigrapsus penicillatus may be seen together with those estuarine crabs mentioned above. Among these estuarine crabs the habitat of Paracleistastoma, Scopimera and Ilyoplax extend towards fresh water region, and those of Sesarma haematocheir and its relatives (S. denhaani and S. intermedia) into the swamns and marshes and further towards the land near the river.

(1912, Siboga Expeditie monogr. 396, p. 51), has recently been obtained for the first time in Japan at Mitohama coast, near Misaki. It has a characteristic spine in the middle of the antero-lateral border, and a spinule at the junction of the antero-lateral and postero-lateral borders, so that it may safely be identified to IHLE'S subspecies. According to Dr. T. SAKAI, this subspecies has also been obtained by Mr. K. Suzuki, a member of our Carcinological Society, at Niijima, Izu Isls,

The writer has been studying the crab-fauna of this district and its adjacent waters in spare times of his onerous duties, as the result of which 90 species of crabs are shown in the list of this paper. Of them 6 species are fresh-water crabs, while 84 species are marine consisting of 3 nothern forms, 50 southern forms, and 31 intermediate forms. Among 50 southern forms 22 species are distributed further northwards, for instance, they are found in the list of crabs of Toyama Bay.

(N.) pelagicus, Atergatis subdentatus, Eucrate crenata, Ommatocarcinus macgillivrayi, Plagusia dentipes and others in the Japan Sea side has never been recorded up to now. These peculialities of the distributions coincide with the course and its largeness of the warm current along the coast of this district.

N2  - Macrocheira kaempferi DE HAAN, a well-known giant crab, is an endemic species of the Japanese waters ranging from Sagami Bay southward to Kyushu. Fortunately enough, some living specimens of this crab were collected off Kamae, Kyushu, handed over to our aquarium at the end of March, 1962 and kept in a tank for display for a few months. During the time, the writer had an opportunity to observe the mating habit that had not been reported up to then. In this article, an observation on the sexual behavior of the noticeable macrocheiroid crab is described and in addition, the various postures of the pairing crab in different stages are shown by photographs.

N2  - An abnormality was found in the left cheliped of a female of Macroph-thalmus japonicus DE HAAN obtained at the mud-flats of Hiragata Bay in Yokosuka, Harbour, 1961. The abnormal cheliped is apparently smaller in size and lighter in colour than in the normal right cheliped. In this abnormal cheliped the immovable finger is rather normal in size and shape; at the base of this segment, a process of a good size is projecting at an angle of about 70°. This process looks like an appearance of the movable finger, however it has no articulation at the base; moreover, a small chela-like structure may be found at the proximal portion of the propodus, the chela being rather normal in structure and the movable finger is freely articulated against the immovable finger. These four finger-1ike processes (the original immoval finger, the dectylus-like process and the two fingers on the processes at the base) are found on the same plane, thus this abnormality seems to agree with Bateson's "super-regeneration".
