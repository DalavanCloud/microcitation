N2  - Further investigation into the evolutionary relationships of the vireya group of Rhododendron, utilising nuclear DNA sequence data, has demonstrated that this group of species is monophyletic, and a revised classification is presented. The name Vireya is predated at sectional level by several other valid names and the correct name for the section is now Schistanthe. Within Schistanthe, four subsections are recognised: Discovireya, Euvireya, Malayovireya and Pseudovireya. Revised identification keys are provided. Some morphological features of value for classification and/or species delimitation are briefly discussed.

N2  - Ulmus pollen characterised by a four-pored morphology was reported from samples of various ages taken from the radiocarbon dated pollen sites of Pea Sim-sim and Tao Sipinggan and in one sample from the undated Pea Sijajap record (Maloney, 1984). All these sites are located on the Toba Plateau, south of Lake Toba, over 50 km away from the nearest existing sources (Touw  Van Steenis, 1968) of Ulmus lancaeafolia Roxb. ex Wall. Sibisa Swamp is situated east of Lake Toba, at 98°58'E, 2°33'N, near the tourist resort of Prapat and much closer to the Karo Highlands source. It is in an area of fresh-looking volcanic topography at an altitude of c. 1300 m.The site was discovered and cored by Flenley and Morley in 1972 (cf. Morley et al., 1973). They described the vegetation of the swamp as somewhat disturbed and including a variety of species characteristic of swamps in central Sumatra, of which three: Eleocharis sp., Xyris cf. capensis and Blechnum orientale were listed. The writer made additional borings in 1973 but the longest was only 1.50 m deep. It can be added that the centre of the swamp was dominated by Eleocharis ochrostachys Steud. with some Xyris capensis Thunb. and that the Blechnum orientale L. formed an outer vegetation ring. The deepest boring was made at the centre of the site. Samples were taken at 5 cm intervals but complete cores sections were not sent back to the laboratory and larger samples selected for possible 14 C dating have, unfortunately, been mislaid over time.

Apart from full synonymy and descriptions, this monograph will include the phylogenetic systematics of this group. The phylogenetic relationships established lead to the recognition of the holophyletic genera Aglaomorpha and Drynaria only. The generic delimitation of Drynaria is not affected, but Aglaomorpha needs to be emended including all other (mostly monotypic) drynarioid genera. As a consequence, the following nomenclatural changes are necessary.Aglaomorpha latipinna (C. Chr.) Roos, comb. et stat. nov. – Basionym: Holostachyum hieronymi Copel. var. latipinna C.

Laminations in the endexine and the presence of a mixed endexine-ectexine layer are demonstrated with TEM sections. Four pollen types, one of which can be subdivided into 8 subtypes, are distinguished and related to each other. The functional morphology and phylogeny of these types is compared with macromorphologic, ecologic and geographic evidence and expressed in a cladogram. The genus probably originated in East Gondwanaland and secondarily invaded Southeast Asia. Its position within Harpullieae is briefly discussed.

N2  - Starting point of the present study on Harpullia was the taxonomic revision of that genus by Leenhouts  Vente (Blumea 28, 1982, 1-51). The system to which that revision led is primarily intuitive and accordingly subjective. The intention of the present paper is to give a more natural system based upon more objective criteria and with the use of more scientific methods.The fundamentals of a systematic study are species and characters (see chapter 2). The species are those presented in the taxonomic revision; the characters used are tabulated in the form of a synoptic key (see chapter 2 B).In chapter 3 a survey is given of two intuitive systems, the one by Leenhouts  Vente and the preceding one by Radlkofer (1933-34).The first approach was towards a phenetic system (chapter 4). The method used is a kind of simplified numerical taxonomy with weighted characters. Weighting of characters is based upon the supposition that a character which is constant in most of the taxa concerned is heavier than one that varies in several taxa. The phenetic system to which this led is expressed in figure 1 and given at the end of chapter 4.In chapter 5 a phylogenetic approach is given. Phylogenetic valuation of characters, primarily with the use of out-group analysis, secondary of correlation, is discussed (5 A). All species got a phylogenetic formula, giving the primitive or derived states of the characters used, and a phylogenetic value expressing the degree of primitiveness or derivative (5 B). The method used is a simplified Hennigian cladistics, resulting in a kind of Wagner tree (fig. 2).In chapter 6A a comparison is made between the intuitive systems, mainly the one by Leenhouts  Vente, the phenetic and the phylogenetic system developed here, and the pollen morphological phylogenetic system given by J. Muller (Blumea 31, 1985, 161-218, this issue). As a whole there appears to be a good agreement in many points between the different systems. The main exceptions are Harpullia cupanioides and still more so H. hillii because of their variability, H. longipetala that is macromorphologically rather primitive but palynologically advanced, and H. rhachiptera with a very aberrant pollen type and an uncertain position in the phylogenetic system.A translation of phylogenetic systematics into formal taxonomy has been tried in chapter 6 B. It appeared difficult to express the branching of the phylogenetic scheme in the hierarchy of taxonomy, mainly because taxa should be delimited by clear boundaries defined by good, preferably conspicuous characters. The subdivision of Harpullia into two subgenera, Otonychium, incl. H. arborea and H. pendula, and Harpullia with the further 24 species is indisputable. More hesitatingly, a further division of subg. Harpullia into two sections, Harpulliastrum with only H. austro-caledonica and Harpullia with the other species is accepted. For different reasons it appeared impossible or undesirable to split off some other at first sight well circumscribed groups, however.

One new subgenus and 17 new sections are described, and 94 species are enumerated, of which 11 species and 1 variety are described as new, and 3 varieties have been raised to specific rank. Two keys are given to the 18 sections; each section has a key to the species.

However, when using the whole distribution of the frequency of occurrence at different elevations instead of the one value of the lower range limit only, I come to the conclusion that the proposed explanation for the elevation effect cannot be shown by the data assembled by him. Yet, the ideas behind this approach lead to the interesting perspective of the possibility to define these kind of distributions partly in static terms, and partly in dynamic ones. Thus far they have been looked at from a static point of view only.

N2  - Dysolobium is a small legume genus, consisting of 4 species. It is closely related to Vigna, from which it differs by the shape of the wing petals and by the velvety, almost woody pods. Recently the genus has been divided into 2 subgenera, but in this paper the subgenus Dolichovigna is transferred back to Vigna.Possible relations between Dysolobium and genera as Vigna, Phaseolus, Canavalia, Dolichos, Psophocarpus, and Pueraria are discussed. Vigna seems to be the most closely related genus.Dysolobium is a Southeast Asian genus, two species of which are endemic and two more widespread; one of the latter ranges from India to Java (not extending more eastwards). The plants prefer a climate with a seasonal drought.Vigna pilosa is the only species in Vigna subgenus Dolichovigna. Vigna clarkei is excluded from this subgenus.

N2  - During a checking of generic names of Malesian plants I asked the opinion of Mr. C.Jeffrey (Kew) about the status of the monotypic genus Guerreroia Merr., described from Luzon. In his opinion it deserves generic distinction.Fortunately Merrill’s description was accompanied by an excellent figure from which I had much earlier concluded that the species had already been described in Bidens, as B. tridentata Turcz., also from Luzon, which Merrill had erroneously reduced to Glossogyne tenuifolia Cass, in his Enumeration of Philippine Flowering Plants vol. 3 (1923)613.

N2  - Two new genera, Aenigmopteris and Ataxipteris, are established. Aenigmopteris resembles Ctenitis C. Chr. in its frond-form and venation but has scales and indusia like those of Tectaria Cav. and in its narrowly winged pinna-rachises approaches Lastreopsis Ching. Its type species (from Luzon) was originally named Dryopteris dubia Copel.; it includes also Dryopteris pulchra Copel. from New Guinea and three new species: Aenigmopteris mindanaensis from Mindanao, A. elegans from Sabah, and A. katoi from Indonesian Borneo. Its relationship to Psomiocarpa Presl is discussed. Ataxipteris, based on a single species of southern China and Japan originally named Tectaria sinii Ching, resembles Tectaria in frond-form and venation but has scales like those of Ctenitis. In both new genera there are thick hairs between veins on the upper surface as in many species of Tectaria but not in Ctenitis; both genera lack the cylindric glands which are characteristic of Ctenitis. In spore characters Aenigmopteris and Psomiocarpa resemble some species of Tectaria, and Ataxipteris resembles some species of Ctenitis.

The two genera are very similar in most aspects of their vegetative anatomy and together take a very isolated position in the Flacourtiaceae on account of their xylem anatomy and stomatal type. Differences in indumentum, crystal complement and epidermal cell morphology (whether or not papillate) support the distinction of Streptothamnus moorei from Berberidopsis sensu Veldkamp, i.e., including Berberidopsis corallina and B. beckleri (formerly Streptothamnus beckleri).

The monograph includes keys, full synonymy, descriptions, representative specimens examined, an index to collectors’ names and numbers, illustrations, spore photomicrographs, and distribution maps for all species. Morphologically, the subsection is recognized by scaly rhizomes, petioles and laminae, obtuse leaf apices, and spores that are about twice as long as in other species of Elaphoglossum. Fifteen species of subsect. Muscosa are here recognized, with no subspecies or varieties. All of the species are Neotropical occurring from southern Mexico to Bolivia and Southeastern Brazil, with three species in the West Indies. Most of the species occur in the Andes from 1500–4000 m, primarily in cloud forests and páramos. Three new species are described: E. novogranatense, E. oreophilum, and E. quisqueyanum. The name E. glabrescens A.Vasco, nom.  stat. nov. is proposed. Lectotypes are designated for E. aschersonii, E. bellermannianum, E. blandum, E. caulolepia, E. corderoanum, E. decipiens, E. ellipsoideum, E. engelii, E. gardnerianum, E. lehmannianum, E. muscosum, E. viscidulum, E. yarumalense, and E. yatesii.

N2  - At the age of 61, Jan Muller died on 5 October 1983, after a very short illness which only some weeks earlier had been detected. His rapid decline but also his courage during the last few weeks, have made a deep impression on all who have witnessed them.Jan Muller was born on 15 October 1921 at Rotterdam. His secondary training was with a College of Tropical Agriculture at Deventer, the Netherlands, but the outbreak of World War II prevented his departure for the tropics. Instead he entered in 1941 the service of the botanical department of the Research Division that was responsible for scientific research in the reclaimed Zuiderzee polders. He took part in the botanical and stratigraphical analysis of peat deposits in the Noordoostpolder, under supervision of Professor F. Florschütz. From 1943 to 1946 he worked at one of the agricultural institutes at Wageningen (Instituut voor Rassenonderzoek van Landbouwgewassen), where he participated in the description of cultivars. However, the experience in the Noordoostpolder had obviously converted him to palynology and when after the war he left for the tropics, it was not in agriculture but in palynology. He worked with Shell, applying palynology to oil exploration, first in Venezuela (1946-1958), then in Borneo (1958-1964), finally at the Central Palynological Laboratory at Rijswijk, the Netherlands (1964—1967). During that period the results of his research were mostly laid down in internal, confidential reports and did not reach the international scientific forum. In Borneo, however, he also had the opportunity to do research not directly related to oil exploration and this made him known in botanical circles.

N2  - Periomphale Baill. (incl. Pachydiscus Gilg  Schltr. and Memecylanthus Gilg  Schltr.) from New Caledonia is reduced to Wittsteinia F.v.M. from New South Wales. This genus occurs also in New Guinea. Three transfers are made. A new monotypic genus of the group Crispiloba is described from Queensland, based on Randia disperma S. Moore. A general discussion is held on the features of the group and the affinities within it. It has become clear that it has no alliance to the Caprifoliaceae but must be regarded as allied to Saxifragaceae sensu lato, either as a distinct family or as a subfamily. A key is given to the three genera: Alseuosmia from “New Zealand, Wittsteinia from New South Wales, New Caledonia and New Guinea, and Crispiloba from Queensland.

(Sterculiaceae) are found inland near freshwater springs at some 20-30 m altitude, far from the beach. It is concluded that the inland stands of these trees came into being during the upheaval of the island.There is some doubt about the specific distinction of Heritiera globosa Kostermans from H. littoralis.

N2  - In a recent thesis B.S. Fey (Zürich) has developed a new theory about the origin of the cupule in Fagaceae. He has concluded that the appendages (spines, lamellae, etc.) on the outside of the cupule are regularly arranged and that they reflect a condensation (concrescence) of a dichasial flower system, so that cupule and fruit(s) form together the representation of one ancestral inflorescence; the cupular appendages would then largely represent the bracts of the ancestral inflorescence.This stands in contrast with former opinions, in which the cupule was interpreted as of separate vegetative origin from the nut(s) which was (were) the remain (s) of the inflorescence.

Due to a different post-fertilization development the variation in seed coat morphology is considerable. Primitive features of the Xanthophyllum seed are thick endosperm with foliaceous cotyledons, a well-developed palisade layer and a thick mesophyll layer.

N2  - Attention is drawn to the differences in place and time of origin of the abaxial (upper) and adaxial (lower) parts of the margin of ascidiform carpel primordia. It is assumed that the adaxial parts will develop more fully when the primordia have more space and time to develop on an expanding floral apex. The favoured occurrence of the margin at the base of the primordia seems a prerequisite to incipient syncarpy.

N2  - The leaf anatomy of the Linaceae complex (Linaceae s.s., Hugoniaceae, Ixonanthaceae, Humiriaceae and Erythroxylaceae) and putative allies ( Ctenolophon, Lepidobotrys, Irvingiaceae) is surveyed, mostly on the basis of original observations (72 specimens, 27 genera), partly from data in the literature.Diversity in stomatal type, midrib and petiole vascularisation, sclerenchyma support, foliar sclereids, mucilage cells, secretory cavities, and cristarque cells provide evidence in favour of a separate family status of the members of the Linaceae complex. Allantospermum and Cyrillopsis are best accommodated in the Ixonanthaceae. Irvingiaceae (often treated in or near Simaroubaceae) show similarities with the Linaceae complex, albeit more closely to the Hugoniaceae than to the Ixonanthaceae to which they have been transferred by some authors. Ctenolophon seems unrelated, but leaf anatomy gives no strong clues for its true affinities. Lepidobotrys may be related to the Linaceae complex, but its leaf anatomy is also in good agreement with treatment in or near the Oxalidaceae. Within the Ixonanthaceae, Phyllocosmus deserves generic status next to Ochthocosmus on account of the exclusive occurrence of tracheoidal idioblasts in the latter and lack thereof in the former. The results are discussed in connection with evidence from other sources of enquiry.

These two groups do not coincide with the previous infrageneric classification, therefore the characters used in the previous classifications and the difficulties associated with them are discussed.

N2  - A taxonomic revision of the fern genus Grammitis Swartz (Grammitidaceae) in New Guinea has been made, in which 64 species belonging to 14 species groups are recognised. Forty-five species are endemic to New Guinea and 21 species are hitherto undescribed. Problems in generic classification are outlined and the morphological characters used in the delimitation and description of the species and species groups are discussed. A bracket key to species and a multi-access key to species groups are provided for identification. For each species there is a complete citation of nomenclature, an illustration of a complete plant together with details of part of a frond, a full description and a summary of habitat, vegetation type and altitude. All of the specimens examined are cited, giving locality, altitude, date, collector and number, and herbaria in which the collection has been seen. The distribution of each species is mapped within New Guinea and the distribution of non-endemic species beyond New Guinea is also shown. Maps of each non-endemic species group are given which outline the distribution of all members.Following the taxonomic account the geographical affinities and distribution of the species and species groups both within and beyond New Guinea are investigated. The presence of five distribution patterns for the non-endemic species and species groups is established and the existence of a central core of distribution within New Guinea is outlined. Some aspects of ecological distribution in New Guinea are considered and the wider ecological tolerance of some non-endemic species, compared with endemic species, is suggested.Finally, the means by which the speciation of Grammitis in New Guinea may have been promoted is discussed.

N2  - Dicoelia was always considered to be a monotypic genus. Typical are the hooded (cucullate) petals that form cavities in which juvenile thecae of adjacent stamens are protected. Specimens of Sumatra appear to represent a new species. The Sumatran specimens have stipules that fall slightly later and they show morphological differences in the pistillate petals, pistillode, columella and hilum. Newly described structures are disc glands (thought to be absent), probably not functional, but present in the flowers of both sexes and a gynophore in the pistillate flowers. Dicoelia is considered as a member of the Phyllanthaceae conforming with the latest molecular phylogenetic results; a classification that agrees with the presence of two ovules per locule.

N2  - On 28 September 1982 Dr. S.J. van Ooststroom died at the age of 76. He retired in 1971 from his office as senior botanist at the Rijksherbarium, the institute where he worked for 37 years.Simon van Ooststroom’s main botanical interest was the vascular flora of the Netherlands, including the adventitious and more or less naturalized members. The most authoritative flora of our country, known as Heukels—Van Ooststroom, was revised and edited by him for many years. Also in Flora Neerlandica he treated several families, many of them in collaboration with Th.J. Reichgelt. Numerous smaller papers bear witness of his knowledge of the Dutch flora, especially also the adventitious species. This makes it understandable that Dutch botanists, layman or professional, usually came to Simon with their identification problems.

N2  - Carpels develop centripetally as oblique slightly ascidiform structures provided with a seat-like support. The terminal mouth of the ascidiform primordium becomes the lateral cleft of the carpel. Solitary terminal carpels develop as lateral structures. The sections Tasmannia and Drimys of the genus Drimys differ by the varying degree of ascidiform development. Austrobaileya is like Drimys. The structure of the carpel margins with submarginal placentation may have evolved from a slit like that in Winteraceae. Allometric development of an oblique ascidiform structure may have formed a large basal ovary, and may thus have moved the stigmatic part apically. A possible cupular origin of carpels is discussed.

N2  - Outside Australia, five species of Dodonaea are accepted, viz. D. viscosa, a pantropical coastal species, D. angustifolia, an inland species occurring throughout the Tropics and Subtropics, D. elaeagnoides, restricted to Florida and part of the Antilles, D. polyandra, restricted to a small part of Papua New Guinea and of Queensland, and D. madagascariensis, endemic to Madagascar but with clear connections to Australia. Out of these five species three, viz. D. angustifolia, D. elaeagnoides, and D. viscosa were for a long time combined under the last mentioned name. In Chapter II arguments are given for the division of that complex into three species and it is tried to give a historical explanation for the final state of confusion. In Chapter III notes are given on the five accepted species. All further species names used by or after Radlkofer outside Australia are rejected; a discussion of these names is given in Chapter IV.

N2  - Didymocarpus sect. Elati Ridley, later reduced by its author to sect. Didymocarpus, is redefined and reinstated for the accommodation of 4 or 5 morphologically distinctive Malayan species: D. corchorifolius DC. (Pulau Penang, S. Thailand), D. antirrhinoides A. Weber, sp. nov. (confused under the former by Ridley; widely distributed on the Malay Peninsula), D. sp. (not yet adequately known; Pulau Tioman), D. sulphureus Ridley (on some hills of the main range), and D. robustus Ridley (endemic on G. Kerbau). Essential characters are tall, woody habit, bilobed stigma, and conoid pigmented glands. The species that have been associated with the above are surveyed. It is concluded that, with the exception of D. citrinus Ridley which seems to form a link from sect. Didymocarpus to sect. Elati, none is closely allied.

N2  - The leaf anatomy of all 33 species of Heisteria is described, based on a study of 143 specimens. There is a considerable amount of diversity in stomatal type (anisocytic, anomocytic, cyclocytic, laterocytic or paracytic), in occurrence and type of mesophyll sclereids, and of fibre bundles along the leaf margin. Outline and thickness of anticlinal epidermal cell walls, cuticle thickness, crystal complement, and stomatal size also vary, but often below the species level. The leaf anatomical diversity can be used for recognising 8 groups of varying distinctness in Heisteria. H. asplundii and H. skutchii with laterocytic stomata, and H. pentandra and H. scandens with paracytic stomata constitute the two most distinct infrageneric groups; the other six groups appear mutually more closely related and are partly linked through intermediates. A tentative phylogenetic classification of Heisteria and a discussion of the position of Heisteria in the Olacaceae is given.

The living plants were distributed to the Kebun Raya, Bogor, the Hortus Botanicus, Leiden, and the Hortus Botanicus, G.U., Amsterdam. Among the specimens which flowered in Leiden, two different species appeared to belong to the genus Bracisepalum. This genus was hitherto only known from the type collection of B. selebicum. Additional herbarium material of this species was collected by Van Balgooy in the field.This article is the first in a series of treatments for Flora Malesiana of genera belonging to the subtribe Coelogyninae, by the first author. The next revision will cover Pholidota and related genera. Mr. J. Vermeulen is responsible for the scientifically very accurate and beautiful drawings.

N2  - The present taxonomic revision of Harpullia was started by the second author as the main part of her work for a M. Sc. in biology at Leiden University. She concentrated on a revision of the species occurring in New Guinea, paid only a more superficial attention to the rest of the genus. The first author supervised her work, completed it, and worked it up for publication.It is hoped that this taxonomic revision will be followed by two more papers, one on the pollen-morphology by Dr. J. Muller, secondly one on the systematics of the genus by the first author of the present paper. The system that will probably emanate from the last named paper is already used in the present one and, accordingly, will be sketched here. The genus is, as with Radlkofer (1933-1934), divided into two subgenera, namely a supposedly more primitive one, Otonychium, with only two species, H. pendula (1) and H. arborea (2), and the other one, Harpullia, with the further 24 species. Contrary to Radlkofer, however, we refrained from a further subdivision into sections, but grouped the species of the latter subgenus in a more informal way. The first rather loose group of supposedly relatively primitive species encompasses H. austro-caledonica (3), H. giganteacapsula (4), H. longipetala (5), and H. species nova (26). Next comes a mainly Australian group of species characterized by winged petioles and leaf rachises, viz. H. frutescens (6), H. alata (7), H. rhyticarpa (8), and probably the New Guinea H. rhachiptera (9). The likewise Australian species H. hillii (10) seems to take a position in between some groups, as explained in the note under that species. Included in the third group are H. cupanioides (11), H. vaga (12), H. crustacea (13), H. camptoneura (14), and H. hirsuta (15). To the fourth group belong three New Guinea species characterized by deeply lobed fruits, viz. H. leptococca (16), H. carrii (17), and H. oococca (18). The fifth and last group, considered to be the most derived one, is characterized by rami- or cauliflory. This group encompasses 6 or 7 mutually closely allied species, viz.

N2  - Two gynoecial primordia are initiated as discrete units but soon get interconnected by the occurrence of interprimordial growth between them. A rim of meristematic tissue thus produced gives rise to the ovary wall by zonal growth. The residual floral apex grows parallel to the gynoecial primordia in the form of a septum. The two placental ridges arise from the inner lateral walls of the ovary, grow into the ovarian cavity, and ultimately fuse with the axial septum. The anterio- posterior region of the ovary wall also grows into the ovarian cavity to form a false septum which divides each locule into two. The Labiatae show a placentation which is neither true axile nor true parietal but an intermediate condition between the two, as the septum grows like in a typical axile placentation and the placentae like in typical parietal placentation. The gynobase in Labiatae is considered to be carpellary in nature.

N2  - Spathichlamys, a quite remarkable genus of the Rondeletieae is only known from the type collection from Burma. In fruit it could easily be mistaken for Wendlandia, but it differs from this genus in the flattened ovate stipules. The flowering material is most interesting, the anthers are contained within the long corolla tube which later splits and rolls open to expose the anthers. As far as is known this character of splitting of the corolla tube has only been reported elsewhere in the Rubiaceae in the African genus Dorothea Wernh. (Gardenieae); the splitting of the corolla is the main character separating it from the closely allied Aulacocalyx, in which genus it is currently placed in most recent works. However, in Dorothea, the style apparently curves away from the corolla through the slit, the corolla maintaining its normal form and not rolling back to any degree.

The four genera of the family are discussed and their characters contrasted. The fruit and seed of Stichoneuron are for the first time described. Attention is called for the peculiar aril in the four genera. It is concluded that the family is a natural one, in vegetative characters and seed structure, and should not be split up. A new family description is given and an artificial key to the genera. Some observations on anatomical features were checked or established, especially concerning the crystals, by Dr. P. Baas. A concise account of the palynology of the four genera is given by Dr. J. Muller. Besides the new type species, Pentastemona sumatrana. , there is one new combination for the second species, P. egregia (basionym Cryptocoryne egregia Schott).

These families are Begoniaceae, Cruciferae, Elaeocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Hypericaceae, Leguminosae, Rosaceae, Rubiaceae, Saxifragaceae, and Sterculiaceae. Both new genera are reduced: Melachone to Amaracarpus (Rub.), Disaster to Commersonia (Sterc.). Supposed new generic records to Malesia proved erroneous: a new Thelygonum belongs to Nertera (Rub.), and a Trochiscus to Nasturtium (Cruc.); the Viburnum from Papua is a Psychotria (Rub.). All species are reduced to those already known. It is advocated as undesirable to describe novelties from odd tropical plant collections.

N2  - A systematized survey of inflorescence structure is presented of Loranthaceae, s.s., on a world-wide basis, starting with New World taxa and continuing with Old World ones. In each case, material is arranged to reflect a presumed evolutionary sequence. This sequence uses as its starting point the solitary sessile flower subtended by a foliage leaf, leading to the evolution of a determinate inflorescence with ebracteolate lateral monads, and eventually to indeterminate inflorescence types successively bearing ebracteolate and bracteolate lateral monads and, in many groups, eventually triads. Various trends in condensation to umbels and capitula have emerged occasionally, as well as other reductional phenomena and other modifications. The unit inflorescence of Loranthaceae is thus regarded as a fundamentally axillary structure, and not a modified leafy branch.

N2  - The leaf anatomy of c. 60 species of the four Asiatic genera of the Myristicaceae (Gymnacranthera, Horsfieldia, Knema and Myristica) is described in detail. Myristicaceae have characteristic, uniseriate hairs, the cells of which have arms. The number of arms per cell and the relative length of the arms are important characters to separate the Asiatic genera. The hairs of Knema can be classified further into different types. Many species of Myristicaceae have a layer of cutinaceous, alveolar material overlying the cuticle proper on the abaxial leaf surface. In angiosperms such a layer was hitherto only reported for Winteraceae. Guard cells are often embedded in the subsidiary cells. The paracytic stomatal complex in Knema and Myristica is sunken and overarched by typically arranged bordering cells, leaving a starshaped opening in Knema and forming a ring in Myristica. The vascular system of the midrib is composed of an abaxial and adaxial collateral bundle (the latter is absent from Gymnacranthera). and there are always free phloem bundles in the centre.The diagnostic and taxonomic value of these and many other varying leaf anatomical characters is analysed and discussed. Much of the leaf anatomical variation can be used for species grouping and identification, and the four genera can easily be separated on leaf anatomical characters (see table V, and synoptical keys at the end of this paper). Leaf anatomy lends little support to a close affinity of Myristicaceae with Annonaceae and Canellaceae, and although the family shows several typically Magnolialean characters (e.g. oil cells, paracytic stomata) leaf anatomy points to a fairly isolated position of the family within the order Magnoliales. Many of the leaf anatomical characters of Myristicaceae are highly xeromorphic. This is discussed in relation to the markedly mesic ecology of the family.

N2  - Davallia repens and its close relatives have been identified as a species complex in this study because of the existence of continuously morphological variation. To decipher its evolutionary history, integrated methodologies were applied in this study including morphology, cytology, reproductive biology and molecular phylogeny. Analysis of morphological characters reveals several important discriminating characteristics, such as the shape of stipe scales, frond and indusium. Both diploid and polyploid forms are present in the complex and reproduce sexually and by apogamy, respectively. The incongruence between cpDNA and nDNA phylogeny indicates a hybrid origin for most polyploid individuals. Based on the present results, we hypothesize that there were at least two ancestral lineages distributed in the Malesian region. Through hybridization, polyploidization and apogamy, some polyploid genotypes dispersed outwards to shape the extant distribution.

N2  - Pitcher plants of the family Nepenthaceae are vines or subscandent shrubs which produce modified leaf organs that in most species serve to attract, trap, retain and digest animals for nutritional benefit. The sole genus within the family, Nepenthes, is abundant and diverse in Malesia. Previous taxonomic treatments of Nepenthes have relied almost entirely on the morphological features of the plants, with characteristics of the pitchers, inflorescences, leaf blades and indumentum being the most informative. Recent ecological research demonstrates that unique morphological characteristics and trap geometries provide useful taxonomic information, but this is often lost or obscured when specimens are prepared for herbaria by pressing them. In this paper, we demonstrate the value of ecological information in distinguishing between controversial montane Bornean taxa and provide a revised protocol for the collection and preparation of Nepenthes specimens, which is designed to maximise the amount of ecological information retained in herbarium material.

Some specimens represented stages not yet known, for instance fruits, or male flowers, while other specimens meant a significant range extension of the species. Two new species and one new subspecies are described.For easy reference, the sequence and numbers of the species presently treated correspond with the numbers as used in the account of 1979.

As based on the revison by Zuyderhoudt (Blumea 15, 1967: 413 – 425), with 8 accepted species, there are now 9 species of Saraca, ranging from India and Indo-China into Malesia east to the Lesser Sunda I. (Flores) and the Moluccas (Halmaheira). The new species, Saraca monadelpha, was initially recognized through a specimen from Halmaheira which was difficult to determine as a Saracca because of its deviating partly fused stamens and its origin beyond the known area of the genus.Of S. celebica the pods were not known until recently collected in Central Celebes The fruits of S. monadelpha are still unknown.

Techniques used for clearing the leaves and for preparing reproductions of the venation have been described.There are two leaf venation patterns, i.e. pinnate and acrodromous, with intermediate forms showing gradual variation.The arrangement of stamens, chief character used for generic distinction, up until now known as occurring in one series (Apama) or two (Thottea), has now also been found existing in three or four series.One new type of seeds in this group has been found, which is rather smooth, flat and longitudinally curved. It resembles that of Saruma and some species of Aristolochia.Scanning electronmicrographs of leaf surfaces, floral parts and seeds have been chosen to elucidate interesting or diagnostic characters. There are eight new species described and eight new combinations made.

Therefore these differences, some of which are of very minor significance, whilst others reflect more fundamental differences of approach, are listed here.

N2  - The wood anatomy of 47 genera of the neotropical Melastomataceae is described in detail. The wood anatomy of the neotropical part of this pantropical family supports the subdivision into two groups: the subfamily Memecyloideae (the genus Mouriri) and the subfamily Melastomatoideae (all other genera). A relationship of Mouriri with other representatives of the family is not supported by the wood anatomical characters, because of differences in fibre type, vessel distribution, and the fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the presence of included phloem in Mouriri. The subfamily Melastomatoideae is a fairly homogeneous group. Although some characters are very pronounced in some tribes and scarce or absent in other tribes, most tribes show a wide overlap in their wood anatomical features. An important means to distinguish to a certain extent between tribes is the size and shape of the intervascular pits combined with the size and shape of the vessel—ray and vessel—parenchyma pits. Three groups can be recognized: type 1. all pits round to slightly oval; type 2. intervascular pits round to oval, and the vessel—ray and vessel—parenchyma pits more elongated, oblong to scalariform; type 3. all pits round to oblong and scalariform. Other diagnostic characters are the parenchyma distribution, and the distribution of the fibre pits. The tribe Blakeeae can be separated from the other tribes due to the presence of druses and 2-4-seriate rays. The relationship between wood anatomical characters and habit and habitat, as well as possible phylogenetic trends in the family and classification of the neotropical tribes are discussed.

N2  - The wood anatomy of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is described in detail on the basis of 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p.p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; on the basis of the inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s.s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae. Variation in quantitative characters (vessel member length, vessel diameter and frequency) can partly be explained from the ecological preference of the species concerned. Wood anatomical differences between lianas and erect relatives are discussed.

Astronioideae, recognized in other classifications, are abolished and their constituent genera are classified in Memecyloideae (Pternandra) and Melastomatoideae (four genera of the tribe Astronieae). Wood anatomically Melastomataceae show affinities with a number of Myrtalean families, notably with Lythraceae, Onagraceae and Myrtaceae. The wood anatomy of ancestral ‘Protomelastomataceae’ is hypothesized and a tentative phylogeny is suggested for the extant subfamilies and tribes.

N2  - Original data on leaf crystals and stomatal types in 25 genera of Melastomataceae are presented, and discussed with reference to the classification of the family as modified by Van Vliet et al. (1981, this issue). The heterogeneity of the abolished subfamily Astronioideae is confirmed and a separation of Pternandra from the Astronieae is also justified on the basis of leaf anatomical data. The Astronieae are characterized by large styloids and predominantly anomocytic stomata; this combination of characters also occurs in part of the Melastomatoideae (especially the Miconieae). Most other Melastomatoideae are characterized by polocytic to diacytic stomata and druses. The subfamilies Memecyloideae and Crypteronioideae remain rather heterogeneous leaf anatomically, but the evidence can be interpreted in support of mutual affinities.

The bibliographic citations for these three combinations have been corrected, thanks to a letter from Mrs. D. Sinkora of the Royal Botanic Gardens and National Herbarium of Victoria, Australia, and are given here: Thismia clandestina (Blume) F. v. Muell., Pap.  Proc. Roy. Soc. Tasmania, 1890: 235. (1891).

(1891).Additionally it should be noted that the citation of Victorian Naturalist (Vict. Nat.) vol. 6, should be omitted. The reference should have been to the Papers  Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania. Although dated 1890, the volume was actually published in 1891.

N2  - The early development (ontogeny) of the carpels of 20 species belonging to 8 apocarpous families was investigated with the scanning electron microscope. The results indicate that on the floral apex a circular or a convex meristem develops into an obliquely ascidiate primordium by unequal growth of its periphery. By further unequal growth it develops into a young carpel. The terminal mouth of a cup becomes the lateral cleft of a carpel. The different forms of the young carpels in different species are defined by the varying degree of development of the adaxial region of the initial meristem and/or its margin on the side of the floral apex. This hypothesis is theoretically evaluated.

N2  - A revision has been made for the species of Eriachne R. Br. (Gramineae) occurring in Asia and Malesia and including Massia Balansa. Four taxa may be recognized: E. burkittii Jansen var. burkittii, E. pallescens R. Br., E. squarrosa R. Br., and E. triseta Nees ex Steud. (= Massia triseta Balansa). E. squarrosa is proposed as the generic lectotype. The australian E. laidlawii Jansen is reduced to a variety of E. burkittii. Pheidochloa S. T. Blake is the only clear relative, but seems derived from Eriachne. A tribe Eriachneae (Ohwi) stat. nov. is proposed for them, provisionally placed near the Danthonieae.

N2  - Among the more than a dozen species of Podocarpus sensu stricto known to occur on the island of New Guinea inch New Britain, five are not known elsewhere. Unlike most of the non-endemic species, these five are widely distributed on the island in their appropriate ecological zones. Only one of the five, P. brassii Pilger, can be said to be free of confusion in the literature.Six species and one variety of Podocarpus have been described specifically from New Guinea. Of these, P. schlechteri Pilger is a synonym of P. pilgeri Foxworthy and P. thevetiifolius Blume is a synonym of P. polystachyus R. Brown, both extending far beyond New Guinea. Besides P. brassii, the remainder are P. ledermannii Pilger, P. idenburgensis Gray, P. archboldii Gray, and P. archboldii var. crassiramosis Gray. Another endemic species has never been named. Confusion centers around P. archboldii and its relationships to the other endemic species.

N2  - In the present work details are given in the first place for the Malesian Olacaceae, representing the basis of my forthcoming treatment of the family in ‘Flora Malesiana’, in which full descriptions of the Malesian genera and species will be given. As the Olacaceae of Malesia are connected with those of South and Southeast Asia on the one, and those of Australia and the Pacific on the other side, it has been necessary to study the respective materials too. A part of the Malesian genera is represented also in Africa inch Madagascar, and even in Central and South America; the appertaining species have been studied but are not mentioned in this paper.A critical elaboration of the family for Africa and America is urgently needed, but will, as far as can be seen, be of no influence of the delimitation and scientific names of the Asiatic-Malesian Olacaceae.

N2  - Fourteen taxa of crustose Corallinaceae are described from a collection of marine algae picked up in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters along a Ross Sea — Balleny Islands — Macquarie Island traject aboard the USS Glacier in 1965. Three of these taxa are newly described, i.e. Lithothamnium macquariensis, L. zaneveldii and Phymatolithon lenormandii f. macquariensis. Two of the taxa recognized (Lithothamnium foecundum and L. laeve) appear to have a bipolar distribution. The remainder of the taxa collected are restricted to the southern hemisphere. The observed depth distribution of these crustose corallines shows that only one of the fourteen taxa is steno-eulittoral and four taxa are steno-elittoral. The remainder of the taxa cover a wide vertical range, i.e. from the eulittoral or sublittoral down into elittoral depths.

N2  - Among collections recently (1979) made in the surroundings of Kutacane, Aceh, N. Sumatra, by Mr. and Mrs. De Wilde, a grass has turned up which proved to be a species of Chikusichloa Koidz., a genus sofar known only from South China, Japan, and the Ryukyu Islands. As this is a very interesting find and since the genus is new for the Flora Malesiana area, a few notes seem appropriate.Chikusichloa was originally described in the Paniceae by Koidzumi (1925), based on C. aquatica Koidz. from Kyushu. The author pointed out a resemblance to Zizania L., which is now considered to belong to the Oryzeae. Honda (1930) recognized its special position and created a subtribe Paniceae-Chikusichloeae. Keng (1931) correctly placed it in the Oryzeae, pointing out possible affinities with Zizaniopsis Doell  Aschers. and Hydrochloa Beauv. Ohwi (1942-a) recognized the subtribe, also, now in the Oryzeae, and added Hydrochloa to it; he corrected the spelling to Chikusichloinae. The two genera seem indeed distinct from the other Oryzeae by the very much reduced to absent glumes and sterile lemmas, the longstipitate fertile lemma, which is dorsoventrally flattened at anthesis, and not laterally so, and which becomes more or less terete in fruit. Otherwise the two do not resemble each other very much.

N2  - The Burmanniaceous saprophyte originally described as Geomitra clavigera Becc., and known only from the type collection made in Sarawak in 1865, was rediscovered in Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Malaysia, in November 1979. This second collection appears to match the original in all important respects, and permits a fuller description of the underground parts and seeds, and allows a fuller account of the staminal ring structure. A review of the generic characters indicates that the genus Geomitra should, however, be subsumed within Thismia Griff., and the species therefore is to be called Thismia clavigera (Becc.) F.v.M. Another recent, third, collection of this species, from North Sumatra, is discussed in an addendum.

The pods of U. cordifolia and U. collettii consist of longitudinally flattened, peltate loments, those of U. prunellaefolia consist of laterally flattened, longitudinally arranged loments; in the other species the loments are laterally flattened and zig-zag folded. No correlating characters were found, and the differences in shape of the pods are not considered sufficient ground to distinguish groups on generic level. Notes on morphology, nomenclature, and geographic distribution are presented.

N2  - Our 150th anniversary is commemorated in a rather modest way and it is not our intention to make it an important international event. Hoewever, we decided to dedicate part of Blumea to the jubilee, not only in order to bring our anniversary to the attention of our colleagues abroad, but also in order to bring the historiography of our institute more or less up to date.The last time the history of the Rijksherbarium was written, was on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of its residence in Leiden. The conservator W. A. Goddijn then published a rather lengthy paper in Dutch and a short summary in French, in the Mededeelingen van’s Rijks Herbarium, nr. 62a/b, 1931. Since that time there have been spectacular changes in the work and position of the institute and in fact the Rijksherbarium of 1979 is not at all like the Rijksherbarium in 1930. It seemed not superfluous, therefore, to publish a new historical survey.

N2  - At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Netherlands lagged behind intellectually when compared with the surrounding countries. This was especially true in the field of natural history.If we wish to understand the reasons for this backwardness we must remember that during the second half of the eighteenth century the neighbouring countries had started to build and maintain an active trade, whilst the Dutch merchants had secured their capital by investing in those countries, especially in England. The fast decline of our trade with the colonies was one of the consequences of this development.

N2  - As is explained in other papers in this jubilee volume (v. Steenis – Kruseman, Smit) it was not on purpose, but by coincidence that the Rijksherbarium came to Leiden. However, Leiden will have been the obvious alternative after Brussels, for Fischer as well as for Von Siebold. There Reinwardt, founder of the Botanical Garden of Buitenzorg (now Bogor, Indonesia), was professor since 1821. There the State Museum of Natural History had been founded in 1820. There was also situated the old and famous Hortus Academicus with which also Von Siebold had his contacts while in Japan and which was the destination of a large shipment of live plants he had brought with him.Actually, shipping the collections to Leiden meant the return to an earlier plan, discussed at the Ministry in 1827. Possibly at Reinwardt’s suggestion the plan had been put forward to merge Blume’s collection with those in the possession of Leiden University, then still called the Hogeschool (= High School). The main components of the University herbarium were the Reinwardt collection and the herbarium Van Royen, other important collections (De Vriese, Teysmann, Junghuhn, Splitgerber) only later coming into the possession of the university. Although the Rijksherbarium came to Leiden after all, the combination was not completed before the last year of Miquel’s directorate (see the paper by Mrs. Van Steenis in this jubilee volume, p. 29).

N2  - Herbals and herbaria for scientific purposes have been made from the 16th century. They were private property long before the time of the foundation of most institutional herbaria, in which they are now, as far as they are still intact, preserved. The oldest, when in book-form, are of course kept apart. Those mounted on loose sheets were treated in different ways and were subsequently incorporated and filed in the general herbarium, as for instance those of Van Royen at Leiden, Burman f. at Geneva, R. Brown at the British Museum and the Hooker and Bentham collections at Kew. In other instances they were kept apart and preserved as a separate unit, in view of the fact that they represented the authentic standard works of authorities, for example the herbaria of Jussieu, Lamarck, and Baillon at Paris, that of the DeCandolles at Geneva, and Willdenow at Berlin. For this purpose the Wallich collections at Kew were, in recent years, re-assembled as a separate unit.Except for the Herbarium in Paris, which was founded as early as 1635, other university or national herbaria were founded much later, e.g. that of the British Museum (Natural History) in 1753 (harbouring several famous herbals from Sloane, Petiver, etc.), Copenhagen in 1759, of the University of Cambridge in 1761, Uppsala in 1785, Berlin in 1815, Geneva in 1817 (now comprising the combined herbaria of Delessert and Boissier, and the separate herbarium of the DeCandolles), Petersburg (now Leningrad) in 1823, the Rijksherbarium at Brussels in 1829, and the Herbarium at Kew as late as 1853.

N2  - The first substantial contribution of the Rijksherbarium towards the plant geography of Malesia and the Pacific was made by the German born J. G. Hallier in his paper ‘Über frühere Landbrücken, Pflanzen- und Völkerwanderungen zwischen Australien und Amerika’. In this paper he suggested that recent land connections had existed in the tropical Pacific from Japan over Hawaii to California and south to Peru and another connection in the south Pacific. His arguments besides botanical were also ethnographical and linguistic.H.J. Lam was not only responsible for the promotion of taxonomic research. He added chapters on phytogeography to his revisions of the Sapotaceae and Burseraceae. His papers on the subject always had a philosophical quality. He once compared phylogeny with a stream of potentialities of the genoplasm drifting in time: the genorheithrum (1938). Lam also wrote plant-geographical essays on areas with special interest: Talaud, Celebes (1945) and especially New Guinea (1934). As regards his ideas about past connections between Borneo-Philippines-Celebes-Moluccas-New Guinea he owed much to Merrill. Lam was a follower of Wegener’s continental drift theory and he pleaded with fellow taxonomists to accept this as a working hypothesis to explain distribution patterns in the Malesian archipelago (1930). Many of his papers were in Dutch, especially of course those meant for a general (Dutch) public, such as his chapter on phytogeography in Weevers’ book (1939) ‘Het leven der planten’ (The life of plants). He took care, however, to publish his more important ideas in English as well. Among many things Lam will be remembered for initiating a series of distribution maps of Pacific plant taxa: ‘Pacific Plant Areas’, which was to contain critical annotated maps. These should be a valuable asset to botanists, paleontologists, ethnobotanists and others. This plan was first suggested in 1939 during the sixth Pacific Science Congress at Berkeley, but World War II held up execution of the project. As chairman of the ‘Standing Committee on Pacific Plant Areas’ Lam gave a progress report after the war (1953). Realization of the project was to be achieved by Van Steenis, his successor both as director of the Rijksherbarium and as chairman of the Standing Committee.

N2  - Soon after the foundation of the Rijksherbarium in 1829 King Willem I of the Netherlands presented the herbarium of C. H. Persoon to this institute. The fungi in this famous herbarium, along with some other collections, among which the tropical fungi collected by F. W. Junghuhn and H. Zollinger, formed the basis for the mycological herbarium. But in the early period of the Rijksherbarium, owing to a shortage of funds and the absence of a curator for the cryptogams, the collections of fungi and lichens were badly neglected and remained in disorder for a long time.It was the third director of the Rijksherbarium, W. F. R. Suringar (director from 1871 to 1898) who became aware of the omissions in the collections of cryptogams and who took measures to fill the gaps. During his period several series of cryptogamic exsiccata were bought. He also acquired the cryptogamic collections of J. K. Hasskarl and L. H. Buse as well as the well-known lichen herbarium of G. W. Körber. But there still was no one to look after these collections.

N2  - In modern handbooks the development of plant systematica is given as occurring in four overlapping phases: the pioneer (or exploratory) phase, the consolidation phase, the biosystematic phase, and the encyclopaedic phase. In systematic phycology research is still largely in the pioneer phase, with scattered attempts to reach the second, third, or even fourth phase. In many cases in phycology the biosystematic phase has to precede the consolidation phase. Knowledge of algae (growing mainly in marine or freshwater environments, but also occurring in soils or snow and on rocks or trees) is quite scanty in most parts of the world, and even for taxa that are supposed to be well known, the information is often but fragmentary. The encyclopaedic phase is for most groups of algae very remote and probably it will never be attained.Research on algae connected with the Rijksherbarium reflects the phases of systematic phycology.

N2  - The main task of the first directors of the Rijksherbarium consisted of the preparation of a catalogue of its Dutch East Indian and Japanese collections (cf. van Steenis-Kruseman’s paper in this volume). Among those who contributed to this catalogue was J. H. Molkenboer, a young physician who had graduated on a botanical thesis in 1840. From that year until 1846 he worked on vascular plant collections of the Rijksherbarium and got permission from its director (C. L. Blume) to devote part of his time to bryophytes. He sorted and arranged the Asian collections and started their identification together with his friend and colleague F. Dozy. In 1844 their first precursory paper appeared (‘Muscorum frondosorum novae species ex archipelago indico et Japonia’). They then trained a draughtsman and made a first attempt to prepare an illustrated survey of the moss flora of the Dutch East Indies and Japan. During the daytime they looked after their patients and during the evening and part of the night they worked on mosses. After the first instalment had appeared of their ‘Musci frondosi inediti archipelagici indici, etc.’ (1845— 1854) the university of Leiden awarded Molkenboer a honorary doctorate. They started a much more elaborate survey of the Dutch East Indian moss flora of which the results were to be published in their ‘Bryologia Javanica, etc.’ (1854— 1870). They intended to distribute specimens of species described in this work together with it. Unfortunately, Molkenboer died in 1854 after the prospectus and the first instalment had been distributed. Dozy continued the work but when he died in 1856 only ten instalments had been printed.Though Molkenboer and Dozy are best known by these publications they also published several smaller papers on Malesian mosses and liverworts, on Dutch bryophytes (culminating in their treatment of the Musci in the first edition of ‘Prodromus florae Batavae’), and they published a ‘Prodromus florae bryologicae Surinamensis’ (1854). The latter was largely based on F. L. Splitgerber’s collection in the herbarium of the university of Leiden. This serves as an example that they did not restrict themselves to the collections of the Rijksherbarium. Nowadays all collections concerned are found in that institute.

N2  - Since the foundation of the Rijksherbarium, pteridophytes have been an important part of the total collections. Blume, the first director, had a special interest in ferns. In 1826, when he returned to Europe from his stay in Java, he took with him large collections of well preserved pteridophytes which he had gathered there himself. These, together with the fern collections of Van Hasselt, Kuhl (both from Java), and Zippel (Java, Moluccas, New Guinea), were all deposited in the Rijksherbarium.Blume’s studies on the ferns of Java, both in the wild and in the herbarium, were published before the foundation of the Rijksherbarium in the second fascicle of the ‘Enumeratio Plantarum Javae et insularum adjacentium minus cognitarum vel novarum’ (1828) in which the author enumerated 500 species of ferns and fern allies of which, apart from many new varieties 338 were new to science. Moreover, five new genera were proposed: Kaulfussia (a synonym of Christensenia), Gymnosphaera, Diacalpe, Arachniodes, and Stegnogramme. Although no keys are provided, the concise descriptions are diagnostic and meet the highest scientific standards. For nearly all the taxa, additional information on the habitat or the precise locality is given. No words can better illustrate the high quality of Blume’s work then by stating that most of the species at present recognized as being native to Java, are included in the ‘Enumeratio’. It was indeed the first critical fern flora for a tropical region, convincingly displaying the enormous diversity to be found in circumstances of a warm climate and high humidity. The ‘Enumeratio’ was followed by the Flora Javae(1828— 1851) in which Blume illustrated over a hundred fern species — nearly"""" all of them for the first time — on 96 hand coloured folio plates of which the typography, especially of the first fascicles, is superior.

N2  - In the following the role of morphology, anatomy and palynology in systematics at the Rijksherbarium will be discussed, as far as flowering plants are concerned. It will be demonstrated that most of the research in this field is rooted in the interest of individual workers, and that no planning was involved until recently. The scope of it varied, as it was done either for pure taxonomic purposes, or for systematic and phylogenetic reasons, or for its own merit. Chiefly, I think, the study of morphology s.l. originated because Suringar, Hallier, Lotsy, and especially Lam, were interested in achieving a more natural or evolutionary system of the Angiosperms. Lotsy and Lam extended their interest to the other Cormophytes as well.In 1895 W. F. R. Suringar published a booklet which was intended as a summary of his lectures. His idea was that the tree of natural affinities could be a preparation and a guide to a real genealogical tree. He pictured this tree with a number of main branches, each of them bearing a number of ramification systems. He adorned this tree with a winding red line connecting groups of plants from different ramification systems. Formerly these groups had been arranged in a linear sequence of increasing complexity by A. P. de Candolle.

N2  - In the first decades of its existence the interest of the Rijksherbarium was certainly not directed towards the study of the Dutch and European flora. The initiative to embark on research of the flora of the Netherlands was born outside the walls of the institute. In 1845, R. B. van den Bosch initiated — elsewhere in Leiden! — the foundation of the ‘Vereeniging voor de Nederlandsche Flora’ (Society for the Netherlands Flora), later the ‘Nederlandsche Botanische Vereeniging’ (N.B.V.), to promote the knowledge of the flora and encourage the collection of plants for a ‘Vereenigingsherbarium’. This herbarium would house the main research materials for the composition of a flora of the Netherlands, which was the original target of the N.B.V.The N.B.V. was to play a dominant role in the study of the Dutch flora. During the 150 years of its existence, the Rijksherbarium contributed significantly to studies of the Dutch and European flora in only three periods marked by the activities of, respectively, Suringar, Goethart (and Jongmans), and Van Ooststroom (and Reichgelt). Moreover it must be remembered that these botanists were also involved in other studies during their employment at the Rijksherbarium.

N2  - The wood anatomy of all genera of the Combretaceae (Meiostemon excepted) is described in detail on the basis of 120 samples representing 90 species from 19 genera. Additional data from the literature are added. The structural variation of the vestured pits is described and classified. There are two main types, of which the distribution follows the subfamily classification. Considering the overall wood anatomy, the recognition of two subfamilies: Strephonematoideae (Strephonema only) and Combretoideae (all remaining genera) can be supported. Strephonema stands out on account of its fibre-tracheids, type of vesturing and parenchyma distribution pattern. Within Combretoideae, one group of genera (subtribe Combretinae sensu Exell  Stace) stands out markedly on account of their radial vessels, a unique feature not known to occur in any other plant group, and two distinct size classes of vessel elements. The remaining genera, belonging to the tribe Laguncularieae and subtribes Terminaliinae and Pteleopsidinae of tribe Combreteae show a wide overlap in wood anatomical features. The Laguncularieae differ in the ratio of vessel member to fibre length, Terminaliinae and Pteleopsidinae cannot be separated wood anatomically.Although difficult to interpret phylogenetically, arguments are brought forward to consider Strephonema as having the most primitive wood structure and the Combretinae to have the most derived wood.Variation in some quantitative characters such as vessel member length is shown to be at least partly correlated with ecological conditions of the taxa involved. Wood anatomical differences between lianas and erect species are discussed. Synoptical keys to the genera of the Combretaceae and to the species studied of Terminalia are given.

In Ochrosia the fruits are apocarpous, but in one species they are connate for one third, while in a new species from Flores they are united into a syncarpous, 2-celled drupe.In spite of the diversity of the fruit-structure in the two genera, they are very similar in flowers and vegetatively. For this reason, the key to the species in Ochrosia is preceded by a general (tentative) key to the species of both genera for practical purpose of identification of flowering material.

N2  - Jackia, published by Wallich, in 1824, is a well-known genus of uncertain tribal position within the Rubiaceae. Unfortunately there is an earlier, overlooked, genus published by Blume commemorating W. Jack (1795 – 1822). This has been cited in Index Kewensis 1 (1895) 1245 as being published in 1825, but the correct date is 1823 as indicated on the cards of the Index Nominum Genericorum. Blume (1823) consistently used the spelling Jakkia’; however, in 1825 he altered the spelling to ‘Jackia’ and added further species to the genus. Thus, it cannot be argued according to article 73 of the Code that Blume misspelled the latinized name of Jack. Jakkia and Jackia are to be treated as orthographic variants according to article 75 of the Code. Airy Shaw in Willis, Diet. Fl. Pl.  Ferns ed. 8 (1973) 602. also follows this interpretation. In all, the name Jackia has been used for three different genera of dicotyledonous plants; a new name is required for the Rubiaceous genus and that of Jackopsis is proposed. As stated the tribal position of Jackia Wall, is uncertain, but the genus is the type of the tribe Jackieae Korthals, an overlooked tribe in the Rubiaceae. This tribe is reinstated and tentatively placed in the subfamily Cinchoneae.

N2  - A tentative subdivision of Knema into 12 series, containing 83 species. The series and species are mainly defined by the shape of the mature male flower bud (perianth) and the androecium, with in addition various vegetative characters primarily concerning the tomentum of the apical part of the twigs, of the lower leaf surface, and of the flowers. This subdivision into series is partly fairly differing from the division into groups poposed by Sinclair in Gard. Bull. Sing. 16 (1958) and 18 (1961), which was mainly based on characters of the female flowers, mainly style and stigma; these latter characters are presently regarded as of less taxonomic significance.A survey of the characters regarded as important in Knema is given. The genus occurs in mainland SE. Asia and Malesia, from India to western New Guinea; not in Ceylon. Of the 83 species, 63 occur in Malesia, and 30 in mainland SE. Asia excluding Malaya and Singapore; 20 species are restricted to that latter area, and most of the remaining 10 species are of Malesian origin, just penetrating into the moist evergreen forest in Peninsular Thailand. Most species occur in Borneo, 39, of which 22 are endemic.A general key to all species of Knema, inside and outside Malesia, based mainly on male flower- and on vegetative characters, is presented. For female flowering and fruiting material five separate regional keys, one for mainland SE. Asia (excl. Malaya and Singapore), and four keys covering the Malesian area, also using in addition vegetative characters, is presented. As compared to Sinclair’s monograph (1961), in which 37 species, 14 varieties, and 1 form were accepted, several species have presently been taken out of synonymy and re-installed, necessitating the redescription of many species. Many of the newly proposed species appeared to be not yet or insufficiently collected at the time of Sinclair's treatment.Description and discussion of the 12 newly proposed series. Enumeration and treatment of all species accepted. Several species have been subdivided into subspecies, varieties, or forms. Besides the 12 new series, 25 new species, 8 new subspecies, 3 new varieties, and 3 new forms are described, and in addition there are several proposals of a new status of already existing taxa. For all new names and combinations, see the index. All extra-Malesian taxa are fully treated, providing for synonymy, typification, description, notes, and enumeration of examined specimens; of the Malesian species usually merely the synonymy, types, some notes, and examined specimens are presented, as full descriptions of these species will appear in Flora Malesiana. An index of all scientific names pertaining to Knema is given at the end.

N2  - In Hydnocarpus the hard layers of the seed coat develop from the epidermides of both integuments where they are contiguous. This does not conform with the division of the Angiosperm seeds into testal or tegmic. Corner’s suggestion of two unallied groups in the Flacourtiaceae, namely an integumental and a pachychalazal one, cannot be corroborated. The seeds of Kiggelaria closely resemble those of Hydnocarpus.In Casearia the development of the fruit wall and its vascular bundles is different for the Asian and the American species studied. The three parietal placentae are confluent over the base of the ovary. The seeds are exotegmic, as described by Corner; the ovules are atropous.The berries and seeds of Berberidopsis are described for the first time. The seeds have a softly parenchymatic raphe. The embryo is small. The inner integument is absorbed during development. The inner epidermis of the outer integument forms a lignified crystalliferous layer. The affinity of Berberidopsis is discussed.

N2  - The important genus Agathis is well represented in the rich flora of the island of Borneo. In some places it forms nearly pure stands and has been heavily exploited for its resin and for lumber. Three species, one of which merely represents leaf variations from another, have been proposed previously for this genus in Borneo (Warburg, 1900; Meijer Drees, 1940). Several hundred collection numbers can be found in the major herbaria, much the majority of which belong to one species. This is particularly true for the non-Asian herbaria. During several field trips to Borneo, however, I identified three additional quite distinct unnamed species. The great variability of leaf size and shape even on individual plants in this genus together with difficulty in making good representative collections from these immense trees has surely hindered the recognition of the distinctions to be described here. None of these species has been totally overlooked, to be sure, inasmuch as a few specimens of each have previously reached the major herbaria. Furthermore, Whitmore (1979) concluded after seeing some of this material that it did not correspond to any of the species already described from Borneo but in fact represented Agathis dammara, a species not actually found in Borneo. I will describe all five Borneo species in order to clarify their distinctions. Only fully mature pollen cones and seed cone scales will be considered in this description along with as much as possible the normal foliage leaves as opposed to the poorly developed leaves of primary branches and seed cone bearing shoots.

Coalescent cotyledons, recorded until now only for Gluta renghas, have been found occurring also in other species of the genus Gluta.An Indian species described as Ficus (Moraceae), suggested to be an Anacardiaceous plant, belongs to Nothopegia (extra-Malesian genus).A historical review and typification for the subdivisions of Mangifera have been made; two sections of this genus have been accepted and their representatives listed.

N2  - Structure and distribution of the foliar epidermal hairs of 109 species and two varieties belonging to 39 genera of the family Acanthaceae have been studied. Both glandular and non-glandular epidermal hairs have been recorded in the investigated taxa. The glandular hairs may be subsessile or long-stalked. The subsessile glandular hairs are of two types: i) Glandular head panduriform, 2-celled, and ii) Glandular head globular or disc-shaped, 2—8- or more-celled. Subfamilies Nelsonioideae and Thunbergioideae are characteri«*H hv thfi nanduriform hairs, while Mendoncioideae and Acanthoideae have glandular hairs with a globular head. Long-stalked glandular hairs are present only in nine species. Non-glandular hairs are also widely distributed in the family; they are present in all but ten species. They may be unicellular, or multicellular uniseriate; rarely they are branched. Though the non-glandular hairs are of diagnostic importance at species level only, in some genera like Barleria, Ruttya, , and Äphelandra, they are quite characteristic. The present study does not support Bremekamp's (1965) delimitation of the family Acanthaceae, involving the transfer of Lindau's (1895) subfamily Nelsonioideae to Scrophulariaceae, and the raising of his subfamilies Thunbergioideae and Mendoncioideae to the rank of independent families. Instead, the retention of Nelsonioideae, Thunbergioideae, Mendoncioideae, and Acanthoideae within the family Acanthaceae is favoured.

N2  - Melaleuca Linn., Mant. 1 (1767) 14 (nom. cons), and Callistemon R. Br., App. Flind. Voy. 2: App. 3 (1814) 547, are centred in Australia where they are represented by about 180 and 40 species respectively, including the type species of both genera. Six of the Melaleucas extend to New Guinea and one of these continues to south east Asia.In New Caledonia there are three species of Melaleuca: one a common tree forming an open woodland at lower elevations mostly in non-ultrabasic areas (M. quinquenervia – ‘Niaouli’. Also in east Australia and New Guinea); the others small-leaved shrubs at low to middle elevations in the southern ultrabasic region (M. gnidioides, M. brongniartii). Callistemon is represented by four species, of which three are shrubs to small trees restricted to low to middle elevation shrub associations in the southern ultrabasic area (C pancheri. C. buseanum, C. suberosum) and the fourth (C. gnidioides), a small-leaved shrub with two varieties, also occurs on some of the northern ultrabasic areas as well as in the south.

N2  - The type species of tie genus Polyscias (P. pinnata J. R.  G. Forst.) is closely related to a small number of Pacific and Indo-Malayan species, several of which have long been in cultivation. This group of species have a distinctive facies but can be defined most readily by the elongated sheathing leaf-base. The genus has usually been extended beyond this group to include other pinnate-leaved members of sub-family Schefflereae in which the pedicel is articulated below the flower. There has been uncertainty whether to restrict the genus to species in which the style arms are free or also to include species with connate styles. In his treatment of the New Guinea species, Harms (Bot. Jahrb. 56,1920: 374—414) does include some species with connate styles within Polyscias though also retaining the genus Kissodendron, a genus distinguished from Polyscias mainly by the united style arms. Bernardi (Candollea 26, 1971: 13—89) resolved this difficulty by uniting Kissodendron, and also Palmervandenbroekia, with Polyscias and this treatment is followed here. As thus defined, the genus comprises rather diverse elements, and these have been given sectional status.

Discussion of the systematic position of Diploglottis bracteata: this species seems distinctly allied to and more derived than the New Caledonian genus Storthocalyx, and thus may belong to an old element of the Queensland flora allied with that of New Caledonia. On the other hand, D. bracteata is within Diploglottis closest to the East Malesian species, whereas the further Australian species are distinctly more derived. They may belong to a younger element in the Queensland flora of Malesian derivation.

N2  - The Star Mountains of New Guinea are situated at the geographic center of the Island of New Guinea extending on both sides of the Indonesian-Papua New Guinea border. Access to these mountains from either side of the border which divides the island is relatively difficult and as a result few collections have come from the area. A Dutch expedition traveled to the western Star Mountains in 1959, but ran into various difficulties and as a result did little collecting above 1500 m. In 1975 an expedition sponsored jointly by the Division of Botany, Lae, and the Rijksherbarium, Leiden, returned to the Star Mountains collecting extensively throughout the eastern half of the range. The results of this expedition include the first extensive collections of material from the higher altitudes within the Star Mountains. Material collected for the Division of Botany, Lae, by J. R. Croft and G. S. Hope while on the 1975 expedition is surprisingly rich in species of Rhododendron. I was asked by Mr. Croft to examine the Lae material prior to its distribution. The collections contain representatives of several poorly known species of the genus, at least one new plant record for Papua New Guinea, Rhododendron rubrobracteatum Sleumer, and the new taxon described below.

N2  - With the division of the oversized genus Podocarpus into several well-marked genera (de Laubenfels, 1969) the widespread species, Podocarpus amarus needs to be reassigned. Certainly it lacks the fleshy receptacle which gives Podocarpus its name. In fact, one or more fruit are borne along a scale bearing fertile shoot, quite unlike the strictly subterminal fruit on a naked penduncle of Podocarpus sens. strict., but corresponding to the condition in the former section of the genus known as Stachycarpus. The leaves of Podocarpus amarus also lack hypoderm, as is the case in the Stachycarpus group, but not generally in the strict Podocarpus group. In spite of these distinctions, Podocarpus amarus was not included in the section Stachycarpus until 1903 when Pilger recognized its proper relationships. Florin refined the understanding of the section Stachycarpus in 1931 but Buchholz and Gray elected to erect a separate section, Sundacarpus, for Podocarpus amarus in 1948. Van Tieghem elevated the section Stachycarpus to generic rank in 1891 without P. amarus but Gaussen transferred the section Sundacarpus to Van Tieghem’s genus in 1974. The matter is still not settled, however, because Stachycarpus is not a valid genus. The proper genus for sections Stachycarpus and Sundacarpus was described in 1860 by Philippi who gave it the name, Prumnopitys. His type species was Prumnopitys elegans which has long been recognized as synonymous with the previously described Podocarpus andinus. Van Tieghem used this latter species for the type of his genus Stachycarpus, making the corresponding new specific combination. The genus Stachycarpus is therefore a synonym to the genus Prumnopitys, which ought also to include the section Sundacarpus. The necessary new combinations have yet to be made for all of the species except Prumnopitys ferruginoides (Compton) de Laubenfels, the only valid combination so far published. The taxonomy of the genus should therefore be as follows:

N2  - In this fourth report on the taxonomy of Ulothrix Kützing a new classification of the marine and brackish-water species in western Europe is proposed. Comparative studies on field collections, uni-algal cultures, herbarium collections and sections prepared for electron microscopy lead to the recognition of three marine species, viz. Ulothrix speciosa (Carmichael ex Harvey in Hooker) Kützing, U. flacca (Dillwyn) Thuret in Le Jolis, and U. palusalsa Lokhorst (nov. nom.), and two brackish-water species, viz. U. implexa (Kützing) Kützing and U. subflaccida Wille. The vegetative anatomy, the life history, the fine structure of the vegetative thallus and the distributional pattern in nature are amply discussed. Salient, reliable characters proved to be, e.g., the nature and construction of the cell wall, the texture of the cell wall’s surface, the fine structure of the pyrenoid, the developmental stages of germinating zoospores, the coalescense of filaments, the shape of the gametangial filament, and the limited variation of the number of zoospores and gametes. A brief discussion is given of the ecological status of the individual species. In addition there is a brief comment on the taxonomic affinity of Ulothrix with the morphologically related genus Urospora Fries and on the phyletic relationship of Ulothrix with the progenitors of the higher land plants. The reproductive behaviour of the species under different photo periods in culture appeared to be correlated with the seasonal periodicity expressed by the algae in nature.

N2  - From 1936 on E. Post has published a series of studies concerning the taxonomy, the ecology, and the geographical distribution of the algae of the so-called Bostrychia-Caloglossa association or Bostrychietum. In this association species of Bostrychia, Caloglossa, Catenella, Murrayella (all Rhodophyta) and other algal genera are involved. Though the Bostrychietum is usually found on aerial roots of mangroves in the upper part of the littoral belt in the tropics, the association is represented also by reduced numbers of species in sheltered habitats in temperate regions.In Post’s monograph on the Bostrychia-Caloglossa association (1936) the number of known species of the genus Bostrychia Montagne in De la Sagra 1842 was reduced from about 50 to 13. In later publications she added two new species.

The generic concepts have been modified and 21 genera are recognized (Ochreinauclea, Ludekia, Diyaminauclea, Khasiaclunea, Adinauclea, Sinoadina, Pertusadina, and Haldina being new), which are placed in three subtribes, Anthocephalinae, Naucleinae, and Adininae, sublrib. now There are keys to the subtribes, genera, and species, followed by descriptions of the Asiatic and Malesian genera. The Asiatic species are described and accompanied by complete synonymy, but the Malesian species are treated in an abbreviated form. Three new species are described: Myrmeconauclea stipulacea, Ludekia borneensis, and Pertusadina malaccensis.

N2  - Dunnia, an apparently rarely collected genus of the Rubiaceae, has always been considered to be a member of the tribe Cinchoneae where, on account of the pale floral bracts, it has been compared and contrasted with Emmenopterys. On examination of the type ( Dunn’s Collector in Herb. Hongkong 910, K) it was found that raphides were abundant in all the tissues, a feature which excludes it from the Cinchoneae. The genus must belong to one of the tribes of the subfamily Rubioideae. The relevant characters at tribal level are: ovary 2-loculed with large placentas centrally attached to the septum, numerous ovules per locule; fruit a dry capsule with a hard endocarp. These characters are typical of the tribe Hedyoticleae s.l. The general appearance of the plant immediately brings to mind the genus Hymenopogon. Dunnia differs from Hymenopogon in the shape of corolla, the form and mode of dehiscence of the fruit, and in the shape of the seeds.Examination of other material of Hymenopogon revealed that the shape of the corolla and the form of the immature seeds of Hymenopogon assamicus Hook. f. deviate considerably from the type species of that genus and agree with the characters of Dunnia, where it is here placed. No representatives of Dunnia have yet been seen from Burma where the genus may also be expected to occur.

Three pollentypes were found: 1) the Pometia pollentype, which occurs in all nine taxa of the genus; 2) the Litchi pollentype, which can be divided in two subtypes: a) characteristic for Litchi chinensis subsp. chinensis. subsp. phillippinensis, and Otonephelium and, as could be concluded from a provisional investigation, also for Xerospermum and Nephelium, and b) characteristic for Litchi chinensis subsp. javensis; 3) the Cubilia pollentype. Possible evolutionary trends in the tribe Nephelieae are discussed

N2  - 1. The interrelations between the genera together constituting the Dimocarpus group in the tribe Nephelieae are represented in a scheme. In this scheme are added the main characters that are thought to be of phylogenetic importance. 2. A neotype.is proposed for Cubilia cubili (Blanco) Adelb., the single species of its genus. To its distribution can be added the eastern half of Borneo, incl. also the Island of P. Laut. Mention is made of a geographic clinal variation in a few macromorphological characters. 3. Lilchi is considered to comprise only one species, L. chinensis Sonn., which is subdivided into three subspecies: subsp. chinensis, the commonly grown form, cultivated for thousands of years already, apparently adapted (by nature or partly by selection by man?) to a monsoon climate, if actually wild probably originating from northern Indo China; subsp. philippinensis (Radlk.) Leenh., a wild form closely related to subsp. chinensis, known from the Philippines and New Guinea; and subsp. javensis Leenh., strikingly different from both other forms, known only as a cultivated fruit tree from southern Indo China and Java, apparently adapted to an everwet tropical climate. For subsp. philippinensis a lectotype is proposed. 4. Pometia, though macromorphologically distinctly derived and, moreover, palynologically apparently very exclusive in the alliance under discussion, seems clearly connected with Dimocarpus, the central genus in the group.

N2  - Though Sambucus javanica Reinw. ex Bl. ranges widely from Japan to China and through the SE. Asian countries to Malesia as far as the Philippines, Celebes, and Lombok, it was in 1951 not collected in the Malay Peninsula, the Moluccas, and New Guinea. Cf. Fl. Males. 1, 4 (1951) 191.This is rather surprising as there are in East Australia two perfectly distinct species, occurring in both Queensland and New South Wales. These two species represent in Schwerin’s monograph (Mitt. Deutsch. Dendrol. Ges., 1909: 26) each a separate section because of the 3-merous and 4-merous flowers, respectively. I have studied material of both and have come to the conclusion that they must belong to one section. In the 3-merous S. australasica (Lindl.) Fritsch 4-merous flowers do occur frequently (Schwerin mentioned ‘nur sehr vereinzelt’) and in the 4-merous S. gaudichaudiana DC. 3-merous flowers occur commonly, though in minority. The number of flower parts varies also in other species, e.g. in S. canadensis, which is normally 5-merous but in which I found occasionally also 4-merous flowers.

N2  - One of the first descriptions of a plant recognizably of the important genus Podocarpus was the Lignum emanum of Rumphius in 1743. Included was a sketch of the leaf and the mention of provenance, namely: Amboina in high rocky mountains, Ema and Hitu regions. When D. Don described Podocarpus neriifolius in 1824 he gave Lignum emanum as a synonym, crediting Wallich with this determination. Indeed, Podocarpus neriifolius has been collected on Ambon and was the first post-Linnean species of Podocarpus to be described for the Malesian region, even though the type specimens came from Nepal. In 1847 Endlicher transferred the synonymy of Lignum emanum to Podocarpus bracteatus Blume, the second and only other species of the genus pertaining to Malesia described up to that time. Podocarpus bracteatus was described from Java and extends into New Guinea although it has not in fact been identified from Ambon. In this same year Blume described a group of new species, one of which he specifically related to Lignum emanum with the name Podocarpus rumphii and by synonymy. His type material derived from New Guinea, even though P. rumphii certainly is known from Ambon. Numerous subsequent authors have accepted the synonymy of Lignum emanum with Podocarpus rumphii.A new approach in identifying the species of Rumphius was taken in 1913 by C. B. Robinson who attempted to duplicate the collections by visiting the actual locations given by Rumphius. He identified his collection number 309 as representing Lignum emanum. This specimen, however, is not Podocarpus rumphii. In writing on Rumphius’s Herbarium in 1917, Merrill suggested as much and called for a critical comparison. Two studies covering Malesian Podocarpus have since appeared. The first, by Wasscher in 1941, makes no distinction between the type represented by Robinson 309 and Podocarpus rumphii. A substantial portion of the specimens cited by Wasscher under P. rumphii belong in P. neriifolius. The second study by Gray in 1958 is much the same in that a similar mixture of material is cited. Incredibly, the only specimen common among the considerable lists of both Wasscher and Gray is Robinson 309 which Merrill had already questioned as belonging to P. rumphii. Gray had not seen the type material of this latter species and was really not at all clear concerning its true character. Some of the specimens belonging to the taxon represented by Robinson 309 were included by Gray under the new species Podocarpus ridleyi of Malaya because of the extra resin canals and the continuous upper hypoderm and in spite of a distinct difference in leaf shape and ecological habitat.

N2  - There has been a notable divergence of opinion in the recent literature concerning the number of species of dammar (Agathis) that might occur in the general area of the Moluccas. Even early literature presents a tangled nomenclatural trail. Perhaps the difficulty in obtaining good representative collections from these huge rainforest emergents may explain the general lack of careful diagnostic descriptions that bedevils most contributions. Among the hundreds of specimens I have been able to study, however, I have found enough data to support a clear conclusion.The important dammar tree was among those described in the early work by Rumphius (1741) that dealt with Ambon. Meijer Drees (1940) reports that natives in the Moluccas recognize two types of dammar, the ‘white dammar’ damar putih) with abundant resin production and the ‘brown dammar’ damar merah) with poor resin production (the ‘white’ or clear resin does turn brown upon aging about a year). Presumably, Rumphius, who spoke of abundant resin, had in mind the ‘white dammar’ when he referred to this tree as Dammara alba.

N2  - Very recently Baranova  Leroy (Leroy, 1978) published a new genus Takhtajania to accomodate the aberrant Bubbia perrieri Capuron. The outstanding characters of this genus are the anomocytic stomatal apparatus (Baranova, 1972; Bongers, 1973) and the unilocular bicarpellate ovary (Leroy, 1977, 1978). During my work on the Winteraceae, I also studied the single specimen of Bubbia perrieri in existence. The late Capuron told me that he had tried to collect additional specimens but that he had not succeeded in doing so; according to him the type locality was completely deforested. In view of the scarcity of the material it was considered relevant to publish some additional notes without delay.

(Juncaceae) actually consists of two endemic species, one in the Philippines, the other in New Guinea. L. australasica s.s. is endemic to Tasmania, while a subspecies occurs in New South Wales and Victoria. For the latter a new combination is proposed. Recent misapplications of the name L. australasica Steud., L. oldfieldii Hook.f., and L. modesta Buch. are corrected.

N2  - At the age of 85, Herman Johannes Lam died at his house on the 15th of February, 1977. From 1933 to 1962 he was director of the Rijksherbarium and although the day of his retirement lies some 15 years behind us now, he is still remembered in our institute for his pleasant personal qualities. The Rijksherbarium as it is today we owe for a large part to his vision and work during the 29 years of his directorate. He broadened the basis of the institute’s research but kept intact its specialization; he succeeded in obtaining valuable collections; he started a programme of botanical expeditions; he provided a home for the Flora Malesiana, to mention some of his accomplishments.When he came to Leiden after a 14 years’ career in the Herbarium at Buitenzorg (now Bogor, Indonesia) he found a small and rather sleepy institute. Through the years of poverty before and during the war, and through the years of prosperity afterwards, he transformed this into a large herbarium which was (and still is, I hope) very much alive and active in many fields.

N2  - Consequently upon a revision of Mischocarpus (Van der Ham, 1977a), a detailed study has been made of several characters in Arytera in order to get a better understanding of the delimitation of the two genera mutually.The differences between Mischocarpus and Arytera given by Radlkofer (1931) in his key are vague and can only be used when fruiting material is available. However, several species in Arytera were described by him and others on flowering material only. Two species of Mischocarpus could be connected with species of Arytera. One species of Arytera appeared to be the same as Mischocarpus exangulatus. M. exangulatus has, besides typical Mischocarpus characters, several features unique in Mischocarpus but more regularly occurring in Arytera.Radlkofer distinguished 4 sections with 24 species. A few more species were described afterwards but were not placed in a section. When searching for new characters on which to base a better delimitation against Mischocarpus, variation in several characters of Arytera turned out to be rather wide for a genus within the Cupanieae. Moreover, these variations appeared to be discontinuous. With help of a few characters, groups of species could be formed which are more natural and better based than the sections made by Radlkofer. Several species or groups of species turned out to be wrongly placed or at least dubious in Arytera. Even the naturalness of Arytera as provisionally accepted here can be questioned.The material studied mainly comes fom L and M (types of Radlkofer). Material of nearly all species was available.

Transitions to the tricolpate type were observed rarely. Within the syntricolpate type, subtypes could be established. For a few species a rather wide range of variability in some characters is described.Pollen morphology correlates with macromorphology as well as with geography, thus supporting the results, based on macromorphological evidence, concerning infrageneric structure and relationships of Mischocarpus.

N2  - The name Delpya, with the specific epithet muricata, was used for the first time in 1895 by Pierre under plate 328 of his ‘Flore forestière de la Cochitichine’ (in honour of his draughtsman E. Delpy, who was the illustrator of that flora). The generic name was invalid, however, as in the accompanying text it is mentioned as a synonym under Paranephelium muricatum, the name under which the species is described. In 1910 Radlkofer validated the name Delpya, but made it illegitimate by reducing the name Sisyrolepis, validly described by himself in 1905, to it. Since then, the illegitimate name Delpya has always been used.The synonymy of the genus and of the only species recognized under it, as far as known to me, is as follows: SISYROLEPIS Sisyrolepis Radlk. in F.

N2  - Tristania R. Brown, Aiton’s Hortus Kewensis (2nd Ed.) 4 (1812) 417, was established with three species — T. neriifolia, T. laurina, and T. conferta. A number of other species have since been added to the genus and a recent study (Wilson, 1971) has shown that the three original species belong to three different groups and further that these groups are sufficiently different to warrant their separation at the generic level. All of the New Caledonian species belong to the Tristania laurina group. It has not yet been decided which of the groups should retain the original generic name, but if the T. laurina group is not selected the name Tristaniopsis Brongniart et Gris, Bull. Soc. Bot. Fr. 10 (1863) 371, would become available for it. Six species are currently recognised in New Caledonia where they mostly grow at low elevations in scrub and forest on ultrabasic rocks. Species of the same group are found in Australia, New Guinea, Borneo, and probably elsewhere in Malesia.

N2  - Arrhenechthites haplogyna (F. Mueller) Mattfeld was originally described as Senecio haplogynus F. Mueller (Trans. Roy. Soc. Victoria 1, 1899: 14), based on rather poor material collected by Sir William MacGregor from Mount Knutsford. Von Mueller remarks that the species could be placed both in Senecio or Erechthites, basing himself on the statement by Bentham and Hooker in the Genera Plantarum 2 (1873) 208, ‘that occasionally some solely pistillate flowers occur in species of Senecio, hence the only characteristic which separates Erechthites from Senecio, is unreliable, and therefore the present plant may be placed in either genus’.Mattfeld (Bot. Jahrb. 69, 1938: 292) creates a new genus, Arrhenechthites, and moves Senecio haplogynus into this genus, after originally having it placed in Erechthites (Bot. Jahrb. 62, 1929: 442). The grounds on which Arrhenechthites is distinguished in the first place from Erechthites, and secondly from Senecio, are rather flimsy but distinct. From both Arrhenechthites differs in having all marginal florets fertile but having sterile ovaries in the disk florets. The genus Erechthites differs from Senecio by having style arms with a crown of divergent hairs surrounding an appendage of fused papillose hairs. In Senecio this same crown of divergent hairs is present but the tips of the style arms are truncate or bluntly appendaged. Applying these data to von Muellers species it is clear that it is a species of Arrhenechthites and not a Senecio.

N2  - In 1969 I published, together with P. G. Heinsbroek, a paper on the anatomy of the stamens of Victoria amazonica. The flowers used in that study came from plants which were cultivated in the green-house of the Leiden Botanic Garden. Because the possibility could not be excluded that the structures then observed were partly the effect of greenhouse conditions, I subsequently took the opportunity to study flowers of well developed plants, which were cultivated in the open air under the tropical conditions of the Botanic Garden at Bogor*). The results were exactly the same. Apart from the set of central vascular bundles, normal in laminar structures, there proved to be a peripheral sheath of bundles consisting of abaxial bundles, terminating half way up the stamen, as well as adaxial bundles. All bundles run parallel and the central ones branch upwards into the fertile region of the stamen. The adaxial bundles anastomose at the lower end of the pollen sacs and one of the resulting anastomoses pursues its course in the middle between the thecae. In literature the last mentioned vascular bundle had been named the ‘auxiliary vein’ (Moseley, 1958). Its position is opposed to the normal median vein, and its xylem pole is inverted.This vein played a role in diverse morphological opinions on the flat stamens. American authors (Eames, 1961), who advocated the primitiveness of laminar stamen structure, disposed of the auxiliary vein by considering it as an insignificant vein. Schneider (1976) thinks the peripheral bundle system is explicable in functional terms. On the other hand, the discovery of the opposed median auxiliary vein was welcomed by authors like Leinfellner (1956), who thought, mainly on the ground of teratology, that the stamens are diplophyllous structures, that is consist of a dorsal and a ventral blade fused medianly. By this view the existence of apparently homogeneous laminar stamens in Ranales had been difficult to explain. However, now the auxiliary vein could be considered as the median vascular bundle of the fused ventral blade, as requested by the theory. Meeuse (1972) took up the suggestion brought forward in our paper of 1969, namely that the stamen vasculature consisted of a bract component (the abaxial bundles) and a flattened axis component (the central and adaxial bundles), in analogy with the Coniferous female cone scale. According to Meeuse this is proof of his thesis that the structure of the stamen in the Ranales is a bract amalgamated with an axial system. However, careful comparison with the results of Cécile Lemoine-Sebastian (a.o. 1972) show that the vascular patterns are different from a situation as described above.

A neutral view is preferred to the carpel theory. There appears to be a link between parietal and basal placentation. It is proposed to refer to this placentation as cupular. Several peculiarities are found, such as ‘ramification’ of the stigmatic canals, penetration of the embryosac into the chalaza, distal lobes on integuments, separate vascular traces to the lowermost ovules, etc.

N2  - Female inflorescences in several stages of development of Salacca edulis Reinw. were collected from stands in the Kebun Raya at Bogor and near the village Depok, West Java. In addition to this, material of S. wallichiana Mart. collected in the Kebun Raya, Bogor, was used in this morphological study*).Salacca belongs to the subfamily Lepidocaryoideae of Palmae, which is distinguished by its large fruit scales. As one of the results of the present study I could observe that the early development of these scales takes place in the epidermal cells of the young ovaries. The Lepidocaryoideae are furthermore distinguished by the position of their ovules. In Palms there is one axillary basal ovule in each locule. Usually the ovules are ascendent and anatropous, the micropylae facing the dorsal walls of the locules. In Lepidocaryoideae, however, the micropylae face the central column of the ovary. Uhl  Moore (1971), who recently published a morphological study on the Palm gynoecium, think that the ovules in this group have turned 180 degrees. These authors studied Plectocomiopsis geminiflorus, and their results are very similar to mine in Salacca. The vascular bundle in the funicle is reported to be twisted, which is regarded as evidence of the turning of the ovule.

N2  - A comprehensive study of floral and vegetative anatomy of the monotypic New Caledonian genus Paracryphia Baker was initiated in an attempt to help clarify the evolutionary relationships of the genus. Detailed descriptions of leaf, axis, nodal, wood, floral, pollen, and fruit morphology and anatomy are presented. In general, most vegetative characters are distinctly primitive whereas those of the reproductive organs are regarded as advanced or specialized. The present study confirms the opinion that Paracryphia merits familial status. All previously suggested relationships of the genus are rejected in favor of a view that envisions Paracryphia as an independent and early divergence from the Thealean, Ericalean, and/or Celastralean lines of evolution. This view is based on similarities of Paracryphia with Sphenostemonaceae, Actinidiaceae and Theaceae in a number of characters.

He has worked in our institute since December 1943, after having obtained his doctor’s degree in Utrecht.At the Rijksherbarium he became heavily involved in the preparation of the so-called ‘emergency edition’ of C. A. Backer’s Beknopte Flora van Java, which was mimeographed during the war in order to restrict the chances of destroyal of Backer’s valuable manuscripts. When after the war it was decided to translate Backer’s concise flora into English and to update and complete it, he gradually took over the burden from Backer who in 1945 was already over seventy. As a consequence the Flora of Java, published in three parts between 1963 and 1968, bears both names as authors on the title-page. Quite appropriately too, seeing that he devoted so much of his time, energy, and knowledge to this piece of work.

N2  - Twenty-eight species of Acalypha are recognized in Malesia. Acalypha paniculata is the sole member of subgenus Linostachys in Malesia and the rest of the species belong to subgenus Acalypha. Four previously synonymized species are resurrected as distinct species, namely A. angatensis, A. cardiophylla var. cardiophylla, A. grandis, and A. wilkesiana. Four species names are newly reduced to synonymy. The molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that Acalypha is monophyletic, as is the subgenus Acalypha. The early-diverging lineages in the genus, and its closest outgroup, consist of African species. The Malesian species do not form a monophyletic group although the molecular data strongly support two small clades within the region that are morphologically homogeneous.The classification system that Pax and Hoffmann applied to subgenus Acalypha, which is based primarily on inflorescence morphology, appears to be unsatisfactory and incongruent with the phylogenetic analyses.

Aegle marmelos Correa, Mangifera indica L., Syzygium cumini L., and Zizyphus mauritiana Lamk. In all the species studied, fibre elements found in the vicinity of vascular cambium are longer than those situated in the outer regions of the bark. The length variation of fibre elements is attributable partly to the increase in size of cambial initials with increasing age of the cambium and partly to the apical elongation of elements by intrusive growth.

N2  - When I revised the Australian species of Aceratium (van Balgooy, 1963) no good flowering material was available of A. ferrugineum. By then the species had only been collected four times, all in rainforest on Mt. Spurgeon and Mt. Lewis in NE Queensland. Although more material of this apparently rare Australian endemic has been collected since, no flowering material became available until November 28, 1974, when Bernie Hyland found a tree of this species in flower. He kindly sent me flowers preserved in F.A.A. for study and completion of my earlier description. The notes that follow are based mainly on this collection, B. P. M. Hyland 7885, State Forest Reserve 143, North Mary Logging Area, 16°30' S, 145°15'E, in rainforest at 1200 m, and on van Balgooy 1621, collected on August 13, 1971 on Mt. Misery in rainforest at c. 1200 m.Inflorescence racemose, 15 mm long, with 8—10 flowers decussately arranged, on pedicels 8—10 mm long; peduncle and pedicels densely tomentellous. Flowers 5-merous. Sepals narrowly lanceolate, 14—16 mm long 3—4 mm broad, with raised midrib inside, densely tomentellous outside, very short velutinous inside. Petals pink-red (in vivo), narrowly spathulate, 18—20 mm long, 5—7 mm broad at top, apex either three-lobed, each lobe indented, or apex irregularly dentate, midrib raised inside in lower half of the petal, the lower two thirds of the margin, the midrib and the base of the petal inside covered with soft hairs generally pointing backwards. Disk c. 1 mm high, with weak episepalous lobes, strigose. Stamens 15, arranged in groups of three opposite the sepals inserted inside the disk, the middle stamen more central than the outer two. Filaments sigmoid or curved at the end, 5—7 mm long, tapering to the top, glabrous; anthers linear, 3.9—4.1 mm long, minutely puberulous, setiferous at the apex. Ovary ovoid, 4—5 mm long, densely strigose, three-locular, each cell containing four axillary, pendulous, anatropous ovules in two rows. — Fig. 1a—g.

N2  - A revision of the genus in its entire range of distribution is presented. Out of more than 50 published specific names, 9 species (with 13 subspecies or varieties) are recognized, in addition to 4 new species and one new subspecies. The two subgenera Pentamastixia and Tetramastixia of Wangerin (1910) are shown to be artificial.Two new subgenera, Manglesia Matthew (2 species) and Mastixia (II species) are established. The former is separated on the basis, among others, of stamens (8), calyx (subtruncate), inflorescence branches (4- angular), and fruits (with swollen septum). The last character is expected to be of value in identifying fossil fruits. This subgenus has a disjunct distribution, broken up into two small areas, one continental, the other W. Malesian. It is possible that the two species are relics.Within the subgenus Mastixia, the two series Oppositae and Alternae are proposed, based on the arrangement of the first order branches of the inflorescence. This character has a two-fold merit: 1) that it divides the constituent taxa into 2 clear groups, almost without exception; 2) that this is an obvious character verifiable in flowering and fruiting materials of all ages.On the basis of this character, the constituent taxa show a clear pattern of distribution, with the eastern part (New Guinea and the Solomon Islands) exclusively occupied by the Oppositae and the western part (Ceylon and the Asian Continent except its Malayan extremity) entirely occupied by the Alternae, with western and central Malesia being occupied by both. It is claimed that these two series reflect two trends in evolution in the subgenus, as confirmed by the distinct pattern of distribution. From the maximum density of occurrence of members of both series, and the richest development of forms in N. Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, it is suggested that the subgenus radiated from this centre.Three other notable trends are: 1) M. rostrata has its ssp. rostrata in Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands with (sub) opposite phyllotaxis while the other ssp. caudatifolia in Borneo has alternate phyllotaxis; 2) among the Oppositae, its eastern members (New Guinea and the Solomon Islands) have 5-merous flowers while the western counterparts have 4-merous flowers; 3) the tendency to fluctuation of number of sepals, petals, and stamens, frequent in the subgenus, reaches its peak in the New Guinea—Solomon Islands area.A section devoted to ‘Notes on characters’ from analysis of numerous specimens is given as a record of information newly obtained. An appreciation of relative value of characters was reached through this search. Among the more diagnostic features in the genus (in the order of usefulness as elaborated in the keys) are: 1) phyllotaxis; 2) number of sepals, petals, and stamens; 3) length/width ratio of sepals; 4) shape and length of bracts; and 5) shape and size of fruits.

N2  - Upon receiving a reprint of my paper on Pyrenaria (Theaceae) (Keng 1972), Dr. W. Vink of the Rijksherbarium, Leiden, kindly informed me (personal communication, dated 14th November, 1973) that the description and figure of Dubardella kinabaluensis H. J. Lam (1925) are strikingly similar to my description and drawings of Pyrenaria.In reviewing literature, the genus Dubardella Lam is monotypic and was dedicated to M. Dubard, a French taxonomist specialised in Sapotaceae. Together with Boerlagella Pierre ex Boerl., another monotypic genus from Sumatra, these two genera constitute the family Boerlagellaceae H. J. Lam. As Airy-Shaw (1966) commented: ‘(the family Boerlagellaceae are) an obscure and imperfectly known group, of very doubtful status’. In a separate entry, Airy-Shaw suggested (without certainty) that Dubardella might be synonymous with Adinandra of the Theaceae.

N2  - When Corner described the genus Dacrydium in Malaya in 1939 he recognized four kinds, three species and a marked variety, but he expressed considerable doubt about their distinctiveness because the available specimens showed all degrees of variation of leaves between one species and another. He finally concluded that D. comosum was, in fact, unmistakable, because of its large needles, but that his variety subelatum of D. beccarii lay exactly between that species and D. elatum. During a recent collecting trip to Malaya, I was able to distinguish four distinct species and to identify the cause of the confusion which Comer described.The confusion in distinguishing Malayan species of Dacrydium results primarily from a misinterpretation of the form of D. elatum. This species is characterized by imbricate scale leaves in the adult form but with spreading acicular leaves in the juvenile form. Before I had seen living specimens of this species I was under die impression that the change in leaf form was abrupt and stated this in print (1969). There are many herbarium specimens with sharply contrasting juvenile and adult branches often actually attached to one another. In fact, there is a gradual change as a plant matures to shorter more adpressed leaves and different individuals mature at different rates. Trees with mature leaves, however, frequently bear occasional shoots with juvenile leaves making possible the collection of both juvenile and mature leaves attached on the same specimen. I myself collected specimens of this type before I realized what this collection strategy suggests to the herbarium user. Not only is there a gradual change in leaf form as a plant matures, but it is also common for a plant to become fertile before the transition is complete. Fertile specimens with spreading needles are well known throughout the range of this species including areas where it is the only Dacrydium species present. A male specimen, for example, Balansa 596 (K), comes from Tonkin; both male and female with spreading leaves as well as scale-leaved specimens were carefully assembled by Abbe  Smitinand (9459, 9460, 9461, A) from Phu Kradang in Thailand; and I myself collected a female specimen, de Laubenfels P532 (A, L, SING), at Ulu Kali in Malaya.

N2  - A synopsis is given of the genus Osmoxylon, Araliaceae, in Malesia and the Bismarck Archipelago, including also one species of the Solomon Islands.In the introduction arguments are given why the genus Boerlagiodendron is merged with Osmoxylon.In all 41 species are recognized and are keyed out. Of each species the synonymy is given, as well as the distribution and collections examined; sometimes critical notes on affinity and variability are added. Two names of which the types are apparently lost and which could not be satisfactorily placed are added as insufficiently known.Nine new species have been described and 20 new combinations appeared to be necessary.Full descriptions of all species will appear in the Flora Malesiana treatment of Araliaceae to which this paper is a precursor.

N2  - In Radermachera 16 named species (among which three new) are keyed out. The genus Mayodendron is reduced to Radermachera; one new combination is made. One Phillippine species known only from a presumably lost type remains doubtful. About 34 names are put into synonymy, many of which for the first time. Species are listed and provided with references and critical notes; for most species the sheets examined are cited. Types are cited and all except one have been examined. Six names are excluded from the genus and are referred to other names. In the key to the species I have also included the species of genera similar to Radermachera, viz. Pauldopia and Barnettia, for the convenience of other workers. The African genus Fernandoa is extended to occur in Indo-Malesia by the reduction of Spathodeopsis, Haplophragma, and Hexaneurocarpon, and to Madagascar by reduction of the genus Kigelianthe. A key is given to the six Indo-Malesian species, with references and specimens examined, and the six necessary new combinations are made. Domatia and stellate hairs are recorded for the first time.

We designate the lectotype of the genus, T. pungens, which was synonymized with T. ananassae in 1917 and add here T. teysmannianus as another synonym. The type of T. koordersianus from Sulawesi has been rediscovered at Herbarium Bogoriense and is identified as Etlingera heliconiifolia (Zingiberaceae), the combination of which is published here.After establishing that T. koordersianus applies to a species of Etlingera, there is no evidence that any species of Tapeinochilos occurs in the island of Sulawesi; the westernmost presence of the genus being in the Sula Islands represented by T. ananassae, the only species thus presently occurring in Wallacea.

Pen. 1 (1922) 290, described after a specimen collected by a Malayan, 10 Dec. 1892, filed under Ridley 3743. Ridley distinguished this from Leptonychia by its 3-merous flowers.Recently I could borrow a type sheet from the Kew Herbarium to which is attached an ample pencil-drawn analysis. Unfortunately, it is hardly feasible to check this, as there is only one small bud on the specimen, which I did not dare to analyse.

N2  - In the introduction a history is given of the development of the knowledge of the taxonomy of the genus Peliosanthes in the wide sense, including the generic names Teta, Bulbospermum, Lourya and Neolourya, in which altogether 35 specific epithets have been validly published, ranging from the Dcccan Peninsula through S. E. Asia to West Malesia.The characters defining these genera are scrutinized and it is found that only one genus can be distinguished.The affinity of Peliosanthes, which is maintained in Liliaceae, is discussed and it is concluded that it should be arranged in the same tribe as Ophiopogon and Liriope.A thorough examination is made of specific delimitation on the basis of the gross morphology which has shown that no satisfactory correlations can be found in the variability; this is illustrated by several histograms.This has led to the conclusion that only one variable species, Peliosanthes teta Andr., can be distinguished, falling into two entities, the subspecies teta, confined to continental Asia with 2—6 flowers per bract and a subspecies humilis with only one flower per bract which is found throughout the range of the genus.A full description of the genus and species is given, with their synonymy, and information is given on habitat and distribution; localities are mapped.The few chromosome counts published agree in 2n = 36.

N2  - In a comprehensive treatment of Caltha, Petra Smit (Blumea 21: 119—150. 1973) unfortunately chose an incorrect name for her fourth variety under C. palustris L. Instead of var. radicans (Forst.) Beck, this taxon should be called C. palustris var. flabellifolia (Pursh) Torrey  Gray (Fl. N. Am. I: 27. 1838). Forster’s C. radicans was described in 1807 (Trans. Linn. Soc. 8: 324) and reduced to varietal status by Beck in 1886 (Verh. Zool. Bot. Gesellsch. Wien 36: 350). According to the current International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, no name has priority outside of its rank (cf. Art. 60). Inasmuch as C. palustris var. flabellifolia was the name first established for Smit’s variety d’, as such it has priority over C. palustris var. radicans (Forst.) Beck by 30 years.

Jahrb. 94 (1974) 549.Remark: St. John described the new genus Luteidiscus, which differs from Tetramolopium only by the colour of the corolla of the disc-flowers, being yellow in Luteidiscus and purplish in Tetramolopium. When considering the colour in the New Guinea species of Tetramolopium as given by the collectors we find for T. macrum (F. v. M.) Mattfeld var. macrum (dark-)yellow, (dark-)yellowish-brown, (pale-)purple, or purplish (Koster in Nova Guinea, Bot. 24, 1966: 571); for T. macrum var. album Koster purple, purplish, purple-brown, brown, (pale-)yellow with brown tips, dark- or yellowish-brown (l.c. 572); for T. macrum var. glabrescens Koster (light-)yellow, light brownish-purple, lobes with light purplish-red apices (l.c. 572); for T. klossii (S. Moore) Mattfeld f. klossii yellowgreen or purple (l.c. 585); for T. klossii f. lanceolatum Koster yellowish or yellow-brown (l.c. 586). From this we may conclude, that it is not possible to make a distinction between Tetramolopium and Luteidiscus. Consequently, the eight new combinations in Luteidiscus by St. John, based on New Guinea species of Tetramolopium (l.c. 554) should be considered as synonyms of the species of Tetramolopium on which they are based.

The vascular pattern of Dorotheanthus has been compared with that of Aptenia: typologically, Dorotheanthus is derived from Aptenia. 3. The vascular pattern of Aptenia has been compared with the observations of Ihlenfeldt: the differences are probably due to the use of different methods. 4. The vascular pattern in the ‘ovary wall’ of Aptenia has been compared with that in the outer floral whorls of Melandrium rubrum (Caryophyllaceae): : it is necessary to postpone the decision as to which type of inferior ovary is present in Aptenia and Dorotheanthus untill more evidence is available.

The genus Brandzeia Baill. from Madagascar is discarded as it is founded on a mixture of different other genera. In the past insufficient attention has been paid to three characters which distinctly count in generic distinctions in this tribe, viz. the occurrence of pellucid glands in the leaves and flowers, whether the leaflets are alternate or opposite, and whether the floral parts are inserted on a epigynous, cup-shaped receptacle or whether this is absent.The genus Sympetalandra is found to be quite distinct from Erythrophleum, several characteristics remind more of Mora.The genus Sympetalandra is redefined and a key is provided for the distinction of five species, among which two are new, while two other ones needed a new combination.Hitherto Sympetalandra was known from Sumatra, Malaya, Borneo, and the Philippines, but now it is also known from Flores in the Lesser Sunda Islands.

Closer examination showed it to belong to Melicytus, a suggestion made by Dr. R. C. Bakhuizen van den Brink Jr. This genus is distributed in the West Pacific Islands, from New Zealand to Samoa; it was mapped by Van Balgooy in Pacific Plant Areas (2, 1966, 103). Though the specimen is male, we assume it to belong to Melicytus, not Hymenanthera. This represents a considerable extension of the generic area.Comparing the floral structure it is distinctly different from the Samoan form and also from M. ramiflorus Forst. by the large, elongated, long-acuminate petals. It is a good match of the Fijian

N2  - The leaf, twig, and nodal anatomy of Alzatea, Axinandra, Crypteronia, Dactylocladus, and Rhynchocalyx is described in detail. This family, as newly delimited by Van Beusekom-Osinga and Van Beusekom, appears to be very heterogeneous, a conclusion supported by the wood anatomical diversity reported in another paper. The nodes may be simply unilacunar, unilacunar with a complete girdling trace, of the common gap (or split lateral) plus median trace type, or trilacunar. Cortical bundles may be present in addition. Further diversity is present in e.g. cuticular texture, stomatal type, hypodermal development, arrangement of vascular bundles in petiole and midrib, mechanical support of the veins, the crystal complement, foliar sclereids, and cork origin. Anatomical evidence only supports the Myrtalean character of all genera, and a close mutual affinity of Axinandra and Crypteronia. These genera, together with Dactylocladus show several features characteristic for some Melastomataceae, which family with its wide anatomical range would also cover most of the anatomical diversity of Lythraceae, Sonneratiaceae, Oliniaceae, Alzatea, and Rhynchocalyx. Rhynchocalyx appears to be closer in its anatomy to some Lythraceae, Oliniaceae, and Melastomataceae than to the other members of Crypteroniaceae. Alzatea shows affinities with all families mentioned, but remains problematic with its trilacunar node not known to occur in the other families. The complex pattern of overlapping anatomical ranges of Crypteroniaceae s.l., Melastomataceae, Lythraceae, Oliniaceae, and Sonneratiaceae may be interpreted as evidence of intimate relationships between these families.

N2  - In the course of studying the Asteraceae for a proposed Alpine Flora of New Guinea the first author selected the genus Cotula for this separate paper as it showed some variability that was not easily explained. While working on this, Dr. Lloyd’s paper on the genus in the New Zealand Journal of Botany 10 (1972) 277, came to his notice and on corresponding with him it turned out that he had studied the New Guinea species already to some extent but had nothing ready for publication. At the same time, Dr. J. Koster of Leiden, Netherlands, was known to work on a study of all Asteraceae of New Guinea and it soon transpired that when the manuscript was finished and a copy sent to her that very same day she had put down the first words of her manuscript on this genus. She generously allowed us to go ahead with our publication and after Dr. Lloyd had reviewed the first author’s manuscript the paper developed as presented here.This group of small, mat-forming species has been known in New Guinea to date only by C. leptoloba Mattfeld, described from the Wharton Ra. in Papua. Since then, however, it has been collected in several other regions ranging from the Carstensz Mts. in West New Guinea to Mt. Aniata in the southeastern tip of Papua. At first glance the material looked rather homogenous, but on closer look it turned out that at least one species, the material from Mt. Wilhelmina, had to be taken out as new. At this stage, various papers by Dr. Lloyd from Christchurch, New Zealand, drew attention to the group more forcibly and critically. The material available was studied by Dr. Lloyd and he came to the conclusion that at least 4 species should be distinguished, with which the senior author could concur. The differences between the 4 species recognised here are considerable, but the species limits are not well known and the descriptions may need revising when further material is available. Three new species are described below and C. leptoloba is redescribed to include the variation observed in specimens from new localities.

N2  - Plesioneurott, originally published as a subgenus of Mesophlebion, is here raised to generic rank. New descriptions of both genera are provided, keys to all known species, and synonymy and description for each. Synonymy is reduced to basionyms except where other synonyms refer to important literature; in all cases published combinations in Thelypteris are recorded. Type material of all basionyms has been examined. An index of new names and of all basionyms cited is provided.Mesophlebion, as here arranged, is confined to Malesia (with a short extension northwards from Malaya) with Borneo as centre of distribution. It comprises 18 species, of which the following are new: M. dulitense, M. caroli, M. rufescens, and M. arenicola. The following basionyms are reduced to synonymy: Dryopteris paleata Copel., D. divergens Rosenst., D. subdimorpha Copel., Aspidium latum Mett., Syngramma angusta Copel. Mesophlebion is perhaps most nearly related to Cyclosorus sensu Holttum 1971. Plesioneuron is distributed mainly in New Guinea and the Pacific, with one species in North Borneo, two in the Moluccas, and two in the Philippines. It comprises 39 species, of which the following are here described as new: P. ctenolobum, P. doctersii, P. dryas, P. fuchsii, P. kundipense, P. platylobum, P. pullei, P. royenii, P. rigidilobum, P. subglabrum, P. subterminale, P. tahitense, P. translucens; also a new variety P. hopeanum (Bak.) Holttum var. acutilobum. The following basionyms are reduced to synonymy: Lastrea varievestita Copel., Dryopteris hunsteiniana Brause, D. ensipinna Brause, D. quadriaurita Copel., D. schlechteri Brause, D. schizophylla v.A.v.R., Aspidium brackenridgei Mett., Nephrodium inaequilaterale Baker. Plesioneuron appears to be most nearly related to Chingia Holttum.

N2  - A new delimitation and subdivision of the Crypteroniaceae (Myrtales) is given; no less than five genera, Crypteronia, Dactylocladus, Axinandra (all SE. Asia), Alzatea (S. America), and Rhynchocalyx (S. Africa) are included. Traditionally the Crypteroniaceae were considered to be a monotypic family. The family is subdivided into two subfamilies, Crypteronioideae and Alzateoideae, the subfamilies each into two tribes, and some of the genera into sections. Of these taxa descriptions, synonymy, references, and notes on distribution and ecology are given, as well as a key for their identification. Of the species recognized only names, typification, synonyms, and distribution are briefly mentioned. In Crypteronia one new species, C. macrophylla, is described. Argumentation for the present taxonomical treatment is given in a separate article in the next issue (Van Beusekom, 1975).

A second specimen was later annotated by Valeton as belonging to the same species. Re-examination of this material has shown that the two collections cannot be considered to be conspecific. It was also found that the second collection and later conspecific collections have 5-merous flowers.

N2  - The pollen morphology of the genera Crypteronia, Dactylocladus, Axinandra, Alzatea and Rhynchocalyx is compared in view of a proposal to unite these genera in Crypteroniaceae. Three pollen types are recognized, differing in aperture and shape symmetry, but showing distinct similarities in exine and aperture structure. It is argued that the heterocolpate type found in Dactylocladus, Axinandra, and Rhynchocalyx and the bisyncolporate type characterizing Crypteronia, may both have been derived from a less-specialized tricolpate ancestral type which has been retained in Alzatea. The wider affinities of Crypteroniaceae are discussed and thought to be with Lythraceae and Melastomataceae, although a more remote relationship with Cunoniaceae s also possible.

N2  - The anatomy of leaf, node, twig, and bark of Ilex, Nemopanthus, Oncotheca, Phelline, and Sphenostemon is described, together with the wood anatomy of the 4 latter genera. Several characters are recorded for the first time.The systematic value of some anatomical characters for judging the wider affinities of the genera involved is discussed. Considering these characters together with macromorphological and palynological data, it is concluded that Phelline and Sphenostemon each merit family status, and have affinities with Aquifoliaceae and Icacinaceae of the Celastrales. Oncotheca shows no affinities with the families of Celastrales, and may possibly have its closest relatives in Theales, but this problem has not been studied in great detail.The leaf anatomy of 95 Ilex species is described, and the great leaf anatomical diversity of Ilex is discussed with reference to Loesener’s infrageneric classification. In general, leaf anatomy cannot be used to support his elaborate subdivision of the genus. Infraspecific leaf anatomical variability is reported and discussed for 15 species of Ilex. Attention is paid to some geographical, ecological, and functional aspects of the leaf anatomical range of variation in Ilex. This range has a general significance for systematic leaf anatomy, because it shows the restricted value of several characters for the discussion of affinities above the genus level.

N2  - Buergersiochloa was described by Pilger in 1914 with B. bambusoides as the only species. A second species was added by S. T. Blake in 1946. Very little is known about this genus; the plants appear to be very rare in lowland primary forests of New Guinea and only 11 collections are presently known, nine of which were directly available for this study, while of a tenth extensive descriptions and drawings have been published.As was already pointed out by Pilger Buergersiochloa is evidently related to Olyra Linné. Phytogeographically this is very interesting, as Olyra belongs to the Olyreae, a tribe of the Bambusoideae practically restricted to the forests of Central- and South America. Only O. latifolia Linné is found also in Africa and Madagascar (probably not in the Mascarenes as indicated by Hubbard, 1959). Some have included the genera Pharus Linné and Leptaspis R. Br. in the Olyreae (e.g. Pilger, 1954), the latter genus occurring in New Guinea also, but Hubbard (1959) and Jacques-Félix (1962) have convincingly demonstrated that these genera belong to a separate tribe, the Phareae. Calderón  Soderstrom (1973) have even excluded it from the Bambusoideae.

N2  - Of all plant families the Meliaceae is among the more useful to man, chiefly for its high quality timbers and for the ease with which some species can be grown in plantations. Almost confined to the tropics, its species nevertheless pervade them, and occur, often conspicuously, in a variety of habitats from rain forest to mangrove swamp and semidesert.For its size, the family probably contains a wider range of floral and fruit structures than any comparable group. In what other family is there such a diversity of primitive ‘arillate’5 seeds, side-by-side with such an array of derived fruits and seeds, and still connected by intermediates? Or, to take the flower, where else can be found such a diversity of forms, from the minute, but structurally complex, flowers of Aglaia, often no larger than a pin-head, to the moth-pollinated flowers of some Turraea, with their slender staminal tubes reaching a length of 12 cm or more?

N2  - The centre of distribution of the Naucleeae is Malesia and Asia, there are but a few African and Madagascan representatives. The revision of the group for Flora Malesiana entailed an extensive nomenclatural evaluation and typification of the genera (Bakhuizen van den Brink Jr., 1970). This has been followed by detailed taxonomic investigations and a re-evaluation of the tribal and generic limits. The Naucleeae, as conceived by K. Schumann (1891), have mostly been considered a highly natural group (Verdcourt, 1958) and have even been raised to family status (Airy Shaw, 1973). Bremekamp (1966) has been the only botanist ever to question the homogeneous nature of the Naucleeae.However, after re-examination of materials of most representatives of all genera and sections of genera one could only come to a conclusion similar to Bremekamp’s. The only character that die genera of the tribe have in common is the arrangement of the inflorescence in a spherical head, a feature recurring independently in many tribes. The genera Mitragyna and Uncaria are here placed together in a subtribe Mitragyninae and transferred to the tribe Cinchoneae; Cephalanthus is transferred into a separate tribe, a move first suggested by Bremekamp (1966). These groups will be treated separately in papers shortly to appear. The remaining genera, as far as can be judged, form a somewhat homogeneous tribe.

N2  - On 29 July 1974 dr. J. H. Kern died at the age of 70. At the occasion of his official retirement from the Rijksherbarium staff (January 1969) Van Steenis and Van Ooststroom gave due recognition to his achievements in tropical botany and to his share in the progress of the knowledge of the Dutch flora. There is no need to repeat here what was written at that time (Blumea 17, 1969, 1—3 and Gorteria 4, 1968, 69—72).After his retirement he was appointed honorary collaborator of the Rijksherbarium and at first he continued his work more or less as usual. However, his health soon became worse and his deteriorating eyesight prevented him from working with the microscope. Consequently, he could not finish the revision of Carex and Uncinia for Flora Malesiana, the only genera which still were missing from his manuscript. It was decided that the family would be published without these genera; the unfinished manuscript will be left to another botanist to be put into final shape. Together with professor Van Steenis he made the manuscript ready for the press, but only some days after a first copy had been received from the printers, Jan Kern suddenly died.

N2  - Dichelachne was established by Endlicher in 1833 to accomodate a species collected by Ferd. Bauer in Norfolk I. Trinius and Ruprccht (1843) revised the genus, adding 6 more species, referring to previously published names, but giving new names as they had no access to the type materials of these. It has appeared that their specific concept was too narrow and in current literature only 4 species are accepted. This number has been reduced here to 3. Some other species have been placed in this genus now and then, but have proved to belong to different genera, as Deyeuxia, Agrostis, Stipa, and Oryzopsis.This shifting of species between quite different genera reflects the instability of the opinion about the taxonomic place of the genus. Some, as Trinius (1836), Trinius  Ruprecht (1843), F. v. Mueller (1873), and Pilger (1954) have considered it as a Stipea, others such as R. Brown (1810), Bentham (1878), Bentham  Hooker f. (1883), C. E. Hubbard (1934), and Miss Vickery (1961) have regarded it as an Agrostidea. Terrell (1971) placed it, together with Agrostis and Calamagrostis, in the Aveneae because of the presence of liquid endosperm. Although there is an overall resemblance to Stipa, closer inspection shows that it is very closely related to Deyeuxia of the Agrostideae in view of the dorsal, unarticulated, and simple awn, the microscopic, but sometimes well-developed rachilla-process which in Dichelachne crinita sometimes bears up to 3 florets, and the punctiform hilum. The difference with Deyeuxia is very slight, and mainly regards the lenght of the awn and the callus-hairs, as may be observed from the table.

To explain his treatment of the genus in the forthcoming 2nd part of the Flacourtiaceae in the ‘Flore d’Afrique Central (Zaire-Rwanda-Burundi)’, the author wants to discuss the diversity of characters found in the Barterias within the said flora, the area of which coincides more or less with the centre of distribution of the genus.The first species was described by Hooker f. under the name of B. nigritana from the coast of S. Nigeria. This species is bound to sandy soils of the beaches, to inner parts of the mangrove vegetation, and to littoral and sublittoral bush or forest, and is known along the coast from S. Nigeria to Fernando Poo, Cameroons, Rio Muni, Gabon, Cabinda, and the most western parts of Congo-Brazzaville and of Zaire. The petioles of B. nigritana are slender, its axillary inflorescences few-flowered.

N2  - The seeds are inferior. Only in the apical part of the seed the testa is integumental; for the greater part it is chalazal. A thick mesotesta is formed by a matted layer of sclereids. The chalazal part of the ectotesta is richly vascularized. A sheath of inverted vascular bundles occurs on the inside of the chalazal part of the mesotesta. The seeds are albuminous, the cotyledons foliaceous. An inside cavity may make the seeds float in water. The nucellar beak persists in the ripe seed. The endopyle is five-rayed in c.s., the ectopyle is a longitudinal slit.

N2  - The name Acrostichum acuminatum Willdenow (1810) was designated by Morton (1967) as the basionym of Photinopteris acuminata (Willd.) Morton. As a consequence the generally accepted name Photinopteris speciosa (Bl.) Presl (bas.: Lomaria speciosa Blume, 1828) was sunk by him into synonymy.The diagnosis and the description of Acrostichum acuminatum in the original publication include details of both sterile and fertile leaves. The material that Willdenow had at hand was a specimen of Photinopteris speciosa collected by the Malaspina expedition, labeled ‘Peru’, but obviously originating from the Philippines (Herb. Willdenow no. 19539, B*). The material is sterile; see also Presl (1851:192). The description of the fertile elements was based completely on ‘Lingua cervina, scandens, Citrei foliis, major’ (Plumier, 1705), a fern from Martinique which is now attributed to Bolbitis nicotianifolia (Sw.) Alston.

Types of ruminate endosperm of the seed, previously unknown in the family, are illustrated and new types of pearl glands of the leaves are described. A single genus with 34 species is recognized, 32 of which occur in the Indo-Malesian area and 2 are restricted to the Afro-Madagascan area. One new species from New Guinea is described. There is a key to all species, followed by descriptions of the non-Malesian ones and full synonymy of all taxa together with distribution data. A complete revaluation of specific characters has resulted in a new concept of the species, many forms and local species no longer being maintained.

N2  - The wood anatomical variation within 17 eurytherm hardwood genera in relation to altitude and latitude has been studied using wood samples from 52 species. With increasing latitude a miniaturization of secondary xylem elements (shorter vessel members, narrower vessels, shorter and sometimes narrower fibres, lower rays) is reported, together with an increase in vessel frequency and frequency and expression of helical thickenings to the vessel walls. Increasing altitude has similar but much weaker effects, and none on vessel grouping or helical thickenings. The number of bars per perforation plate in genera with partly or exclusively scalariform perforations is in general not correlated with altitude or latitude. In the softwood genus Podocarpus tracheid length and diameter and ray height decrease with increasing altitude. An analysis of the wood anatomical variation within 2 species with a wide latitudinal and 5 with a wide altitudinal range did not reveal correlations between the above mentioned features and latitude or altitude. The results are discussed with reference to previous interpretations of latitudinal and altitudinal variation in wood (Baas, 1973), stressing the significance for phylogenetic wood anatomy.

This was unfortunate, for it turned out that Hypolytreae has the most primitive vessels on the whole. After reading the paper, Mr. Pieter Baas generously sent us fragments of roots, stem (culm), and leaves of the following additional genera and species of Hypolytreae: Hypolytrum compactum Nees  Mey. M 970 (rhizome also); H. nemorum (Vahl) Spreng M 969; Paramapania parvibractea (Clarke) Uitt. M 968; P. radians (Clarke) Uitt. M 971.After soaking in boiling water, the fragments were macerated and mounted in dilute glycerin for study. Camera lucida drawings were made of perforation plates and immediately adjacent walls for permanent record.

N2  - In this paper a revision is given of the Malesian species of the Crabgrasses, or Digitaria Haller ( Gramineae). The research was done at the Rijksherbarium, Leyden, while many other Herbaria were shortly visited; some field work was done in Indonesia, Australia, and Papua-New Guinea. The foundation for the study in this large and cosmopolitan genus must be Henrard’s monumental work ‘Monograph of the genus Digitaria’ (1950), which is therefore extensively cited and discussed. Henrard based his division in sections, 32 in the subgenus Digitaria, with an emphasis on the amount of spikelets per grouplet and the various types of hairs, but such a subdivision appears difficult to maintain. As only part of the species of Digitaria occurs in Malesia, not representing all sections, a new infra-generic system can not be given. As far as the sections present in Malesia are concerned, it appeared that the Biformes, Horizontales, and Parviglumae had to be united with the section Digitaria, the Remotae and Subeffusae had to be merged into one, the Remotae, while the Atrofuscae had to be included, at least partly, in the Clavipilae, here renamed Filiformes. The subgenus Solitaria is better regarded as a section of the subgenus Digitaria. The distinction between annual and perennial in the everwet tropics poses a problem; these conceptions have been maintained, but on a more clearly defined basis. In the region studied 27 species occur, 3 of which are new to science; 25 species are indigenous, 2 are introduced and established; in the key 4 more species have been taken up, which were introduced only once, but have probably vanished. One subspecies and one variety are distinguished, both under a new name. All taxa were also studied for their extra-Malcsian distribution; from the resulting synonymy it appeared that about 52 species recognized by Henrard could be reduced to 24. The genus is estimated to contain about 170 species instead of about 325. Finally, some species are discussed which were said either to occur in Malesia or to belong to Digitaria, but for which one or the other of these suggestions proved to be false. Of these taxa two species and one variety were given a new name, while one new variety could be described.

N2  - Harmsiopanax is a small structurally isolated genus confined to the Malesian Archipelago. The three species here recognized are uniform both in their vegetative and their reproductive features. It has long been recognized that some of the characters of this genus are anomalous within the Araliaceae and a return to its earlier position within the Umbelliferae would have something in its favour. The monocarpic habit is unknown elsewhere in the Araliaceae, but is not uncommon in the Umbelliferae. The character of the fruit, which splits into two dry mericarps, closely approaches the fruit of the Umbelliferae, and the vascularization of the gynoecium (Philipson, 1970) is also characteristic of that family. However, the structure of the leaf-base, the tree stature, and the shape of the petals all incline towards the Araliaceae. This genus and a few other genera from the south-east Pacific region confirm the close relationship between these two families.The earliest known of the three species ranges through Java and the Sunda Islands to Timor and also northwards into Celebes. This species, H. aculeatus, is rather uniform in its characters. Within the Island of New Guinea the forms of the genus are more complex. A species of low to moderate altitudes (sea level to 1800 m) was described early in this century as H. harmsii. This species is confined to the eastern part of the island. It differs from H. aculeatus in several respects, particularly in leaf-shape and in the spherical umbellules borne on a distinct peduncle.

N2  - Four specimens of an Araliaceous species collected in the Vogelkop Peninsula and a neighbouring area of SW. New Guinea are so distinctive as to require a new genus. The large, simple, oblanceolate leaves clustered at the ends of the branches recall the habit of Meryta, but the flowers do not share the highly distinctive features of that genus: in particular, they are hermaphrodite, the calyx is well-defined, and a distinct articulation occurs below the ovary. The technical floral and fruit characters are not unlike those of Polyscias (e.g. there is an articulation below the flower, the style arms are free, and the endosperm is smooth), but their general facies is unlike that genus, and this, together with the distinctive inflorescence and leaf, makes the plant quite different from any species of Polyscias.

N2  - The family of the Ranunculaceae, although a large one (ca. 1200 species) occurring almost throughout the world, is generally regarded as a very natural one. The only genera with a recently more or less disputed position are Circaeaster, Glaucidium, Hydrastis, Kingdonia, and Paeonia. The others may at present all be considered to be ‘true’ Ranunculaceae.Various botanists have studied the delimitation of these genera, their affinity and phylogenetic links. Their ideas are often widely divergent. There is no need to go into the subject here, but some opinions on the place in the system of Caltha may be reviewed.

N2  - The leaf anatomy of Kokoona and Lophopetalum is described in detail. Separation of the two genera as effectuated by Hou (1963) is supported by differences in vascular anatomy of the distal end of the petiole, which is invariably more complex in Lophopetalum than in Kokoona. Other differential characters (p. ooo) only apply to part of the species of Lophopetalum. As based on leaf anatomy it is impossible to define groups of closely related species within the genera because of a lack of mutual correlation between the different leaf anatomical characters. Lophopetalum in particular shows some striking anatomical features such as a very variable and complex arrangement of vascular tissue in petiole and midrib, complex types of cyclocytic and anisocytic stomata, crystarque cells, and epidermal papillae. Most of these characters occur in part of the genus only. The variability below the species level of characters such as epidermal wall thickness, number of subsidiary cells per stoma, dimension of guard cell pairs, presence or absence of stomata in upper epidermis etc. is reported for some species. Because of the great range of anatomical variation it is impossible to identify species, using leaf anatomical characters only.

Bandahara in North Sumatra besides the already known Swertia piloglandulosa another, yet unknown Swertia which gave rise to this preliminary revision. This plant occurs together with S. piloglandulosa but inhabits a moister place in the mountain heath, viz. along a small streamlet, and it appeared to represent a miniature form of S. piloglandulosa. Besides, it had a further reduced number of ovules.It may be worthwhile to point out first the difference between dwarf forms and miniature forms.

N2  - The dioecious species of the genus Blyxa can be divided into 2 groups, those with 6 stamens and those with 9 stamens in the male flowers. The first group is restricted to tropical Africa and needs further study. The second group occurs in Asia and Australia and up to now was considered to consist of 2 very distinct species, Blyxa octandra (Roxb.) Planch, ex Thw., characterized by a basal rosette of long, smooth, linear leaves, and B. novoguineensis den Hartog which is caulescent with short serrulate leaves. B. octandra is widely distributed in India, Burma, Indo-China, New Guinea, and the tropical part of Australia. B. novoguineensis is known with certainty only from New Guinea. Recently a third species, very similar in its habit to B. octandra, was found by Dr. C. F. van Beusekom and Mr. R. Geesink in Thailand. From a study of herbarium material it appeared that this species had already been collected several times but had not been recognized as a separate species, probably because of the absence of seeds in these plants.

N2  - Two decades ago the senior author was urged by the West New Guinea Forest Service to name a rather common canopy tree of New Guinea and the Moluccas. Among two dozen collections there was only one in flower, from the island of Ceram. Though the species was certainly new for Malesia, the absence of fruit explained his hesitation to refer it to one of the genera of the Tristania-Xanthostemon-Metrosideros complex to which it clearly belonged. It was finally described as Metrosideros nigroviridis Steen., the specific epithet alluding to the sepia-coloured twigs and conspicuously green-drying leaves. Finally, about 1960 a fruiting specimen collected by Chr. Versteegh came to hand (BW 4702) which showed by its indehiscent nature and fleshy pericarp that it could not belong to Metrosideros, Xanthostemon, or Tristania. The material was laid apart pending later investigation.In scanning duplicates from North Queensland in 1970 he found to his surprise among unnamed North Queensland Myrtaceae exactly the same species. Asking the judgment of Lindsay Smith the latter pointed out (in litt. 16—6—70) that this had been described from North Queensland as Xanthostemon brachyandrus C. T. White. He added that this species ‘had always intrigued him because the seedlings, which are often thick on the floor of the rain forest under the parent trees, have the young leaves bluish instead of reddish like most other Myrtaceae.’ He also postponed a detailed study ‘pending collection of complete material’, but it did not appear to him to ‘agree with any of the genera described in this group’.

N2  - The wood anatomy of 81 species of Ilex is described in detail. The wood anatomical range encountered is presented in a generic description (p. 196). Data on ontogenetic changes in vessel member length and number of bars per perforation are given for three species. The great amount of variation in mainly quantitative but also in some qualitative features is hardly or not related with subgeneric classification but with latitudinal and altitudinal distribution. In both the northern and southern hemisphere and in both the Old and New World, temperate and subtropical species are characterized by conspicuous growth rings, numerous narrow vessels, relatively short vessel members and few bars per perforation plate, conspicuous spiral thickenings on both vessel and fibre walls, and the fibretracheids are frequently provided with rather numerous conspicuously bordered tangential wall pits. In tropical lowland species growth rings are absent or less marked, the vessels are scanty and wide, the vessel members are long and the number of bars per perforation plate is high. Spirals are lacking or faint, or occur only in a minor part of the axial elements. The fibre-tracheids have usually few pits with more reduced borders on the tangential walls. Tropical montane species resemble the temperate ones to a great extent, but this does not apply to growth rings, spiral thickenings, and frequency and size of fibre-tracheid pits. The only wood sample of a climbing Ilex species from the tropics studied deviates from the general trend in having few bars per perforation plate. The two temperate species I. serrata and I. verticillata are exceptional in lacking spiral thickenings. In all wood characters they resemble the genus Nemopanthus (also Aquifoliaceae) very closely.Comparisons with data from literature and original observations on Prunus, Symplocos, Vaccinium. Viburnum, and to some extent also on Hydrangea, support the view that the gradual differences between temperate and tropical Ilex species conform to a general trend also present in other taxa. Therefore a major climatic influence on wood structure is indicated. This is discussed with reference to the major trends of phylogenetic wood specialization. The fact that within Ilex and Symplocos the tropical lowland species have perforations with the most numerous bars cannot be brought in agreement with the general phenomenon of a rare occurrence of scalariform perforations in tropical lowland floras.Other items such as the parallel between the absence of spiral thickenings and the presence of entire leaf margins, the lack of a clear taxonomic pattern in the wood anatomical variation in Ilex, and observations by former students of Ilex wood anatomy are also discussed.

N2  - Descriptions are given of the flowers, fruits, and seeds. The petals have basal scales. The pistil is an urceolate structure issuing in 5—7 stigmas. In it are two whorls of ovules along the wall, the lower whorl in the same radial planes as are the stigmas, the upper whorl in alternate radii. The pistil wall is entirely covered by nectariferous hairs. There is a peculiar vascular bundle pattern. The ovule is sessile and atropous, the nucellus is beaked, the inner integument terminates into 2—4 projections, the outer integument into 2—4 lobes. The ovules develop into inferior seeds mainly by proximal growth. Lobes of the endocarp grow around the ectostome. The testa has its hard layer in the middle. The seeds consist of two parts, a hard container containing a free kernel, an air mantle being enclosed. This is probably a swimming device. As, moreover, the fruit is pulpous, the species probably is diplochorous. The results are put against the theory of metamorphosis and the carpel theory. It is thought that this Malaysian plant is a very unusual, possibly ancient, monotype.

N2  - I re-described this genus in Blumea 19 (1971) 42. The principal characters there enumerated are: rhizome-scales broad, thin, with marginal hairs (some bearing mucilage glands) but rarely superficial hairs; lower pinnae, usually several pairs, reduced, the transition to reduced pinnae abrupt or gradual; aerophores at bases of lower pinnae ± swollen and white on young fronds, sometimes much elongate; pinna-lobes with cartilaginous margins which are often toothed at the ends of veins; veins usually anastomosing but free in some species which have deeply lobed pinnae; lamina ± pustular when dried; lower surfaces never densely long-hairy, sometimes with short acicular or capitate hairs; sessile spherical glands lacking on lamina, indusia and sporangia; body of sporangium often bearing club-shaped or capitate hairs, rarely setae; on stalk of sporangium a hair of 3 or 4 cells, terminal cell enlarged but not spherical; spores light brown with many small thin ± quadrate wings, thus spinulose in aspect.The majority of species here included in this genus conform to all the above characters, but there are some species which differ by showing one or two (rarely three) of the following characters: basal pinnae not or little reduced; scales on bases of stipes elongate and bearing many superficial hairs; spores with a ± continuous wing and anastomosing cross-wings. Almost all these aberrant species have distinctly pustular lower surface, and have the usual accompanying characters of rather thick veins and cartilaginous edges of pinna-lobes.

Altogether 7 named taxa have been attributed to this section by previous authors; in this revision only two species are distinguished: Bulbophyllum aemulum and Bulbophyllum infundibuliforme. It appears that Hymenobractea cannot be distinguished from Bulbophyllum sect.Intervallatae (including sect. Dialeipanthe and sect. Lepidorhiza), therefore these two species are included in sect. Intervallatae. A key to the sections morphologically similar to Intervallatae, viz. Leopardinae, Sestochilos and Stenochilus, is included and full information on the two species provided.

N2  - Leaf epidermal features (mostly studied in cuticular macerations) of 146 specimens, belonging to c. 33 species of all the 6 genera of the Winteraceae are described in detail. Typical for most representatives is the occurrence of alveolar material of cutinaceous nature overlying the cuticle proper, and usually occluding the stomata. Special attention is paid to the appearance, distribution and significance of this alveolar material. The taxonomic value of the characters described is discussed. All genera show an overlap with one or more genera in a varying number of leaf epidermal characters, so absolute diagnostic characters at the genus level are absent. It is also impossible to recognize distinct groups of genera. Exospermum and Belliolum are entirely within the leaf epidermal range of Bubbia. Drimys section Tasmannia and Bubbia perrieri take the most isolated positions within the family. Drimys piperita shows an enormous range of variation, which is further analysed using 85 specimens belonging to 38 of the 39 entities recognized by Vink. Of 12 entities more than one specimen was studied, affording the conclusion that in most entities the cuticular features are fairly constant, though some entities are very variable and certain characters are almost always variable at the level of the entity. For Drimys piperita as a whole a number of characters (shape and relative size of the stomata, shape of epidermal cells over midrib, undulations of anticlinal flanges, subdivisions of subsidiary cells) are mutually correlated and show, moreover, positive trends of correlation with the usual habitat of the entities. The glandular structures, typical for D. piperita, are described for the first time.

N2  - It was on the 31st of October 1901 that Cornelis Gijsbert Gerrit Jan van Steenis was born at Utrecht, as a first child to H. J. van Steenis and Louisa W. S. van Vuuren. His parents were at the time respectively 39 and 37 years old; both had been educated as schoolteachers. They were late to start a family, but life had not been easy for Hendrik Jan, who had been a follower of the anarchist Domela Nieuwenhuis and would remain all through his life an idealist, pacifist, and at least later an extremely religious man. When the poet and author Frederik van Eeden started his community ‘Walden’, he and his fiancée became members and married early in 1901. Walden proved another deception and with a child on its way it was decided to accept a job as a correspondence clerk at Utrecht.If the family is to be believed, little Kees got what nowadays would be called an antiauthoritarian education. At that time his parents had turned to theosophy and consequendy the children (five sons) were raised as vegetarians.

He was born in 1901, educated at Utrecht, came to Bogor, Indonesia in 1927, settled in Holland in 1950. He founded the Flora Malesiana, and ranks as the greatest authority on the botany of Malesia and adjacent regions. Here are expounded, by his pupil and collaborator, the main subjects and leading ideas in his published works, the most important ones of the latter mentioned. Considered are his work on plant areas, the methodical fact finding by Dr. Van Steenis and Mrs. M. J. van Steenis-Kruseman, his work on the discontinuity among plants forms, on vegetation and ecology, his promotion of the relations between man and nature and of education, his work on discontinuities in plant distribution.

N2  - The general bilabiate flower type or gullet-blossom was already recognized as functioning in diverse families by Delpino (lastly in 1887). The type seems adapted to hymenopters with precision of visits: not only by providing a lower lip as a favoured landing place with optical attraction and by ensuring co-ordination with the upper lip to limit visitor size, but also by providing precision of deposition and reception of pollen, viz. dorsally at the distal end.I add that the bifid stigma requires contact in the median plane, not from a side. This type of stigma may be considered as a consequence of the presence of two median carpels, but it also fits the ecological requirements extremely well. It also occurs in those Verbenaceae that show zygomorphy, but it prevails in Labiatae.

N2  - This book is an exploration into the field of Plant Morphology. It deals with the placentation of the ovules in ten families of Centrospermae — including the Cactaceae — and in the Primulaceae. The core is formed by a very close observation and a complete documentation of the histogenesis of the ovary wall, the septs, and the placentae in four Caryophyllaceous species. Furthermore, the result is compared with similar known and newly discovered features in other species and in the other families.It appears that the ovary is composed of a cup of sterile phyllomes which surrounds a central body. This central part is built up by two alternating sets of five axial placentae bearing the ovules. The septs grow from the cup inwards and fuse with the placentae and their ovules. The pattern of the vascular bundles is in full accordance with the histogenetic results. Variations on this theme occur in the other species and families, the ultimate stage in reduction being an ovary with a solitary terminal ovule. However, the Primulaceae do not fit in this scheme; they cannot be considered as Centrospermae.

N2  - Recently, while going through the old collections of Malesian, Australian, and Pacific materials of Piperaceae in connection with the study of the New Guinea species of this family, taxonomic problems that need clearing up were encountered. These are of such a diverse nature that it is best they are discussed separately in each species and not summarized here.This paper is the first of many which will be published seriatim as work on this difficult group progresses. As implied in the title, this series does not deal with New Guinea species which are the subject matter of another series. It is hoped that these contributions will pave the way for a comprehensive revision of the family in Malesia in which more than 400 species have been described or recorded.

N2  - Since Hornemann (Fl. Dan. 9, 1816, p. 3, pl. 1501) published the name Zostera marina var. angustifolia together with a very poor drawing and the extremely short diagnosis ‘foliis subenerviis’ several interpretations of the identity of this taxon have been given. Some authors regarded it as a separate species closely related to Z. marina L., e.g. Reichenbach (1c. Fl. Germ. 7,1845, p. 3, as Z. angustifolia), and Tutin (J. Bot. 74, 1936, p. 227—230, as Z. hornemanniana). Others thought that it was a hybrid between Z. marina and Z. noltii Hornem., e.g. Ascherson (in Boissier, Fl. Orient. 5, 1882, p. 25), Prahl (Krit. Fl. Schlesw.- Holst. 2, 1890, p. 211), and Rouy (Fl. Fr. 13, 1912, p. 290, as Z. hornemanni). Recently I myself expressed the opinion that Hornemann’s variety was merely a brackish-water form of Z. noltit (Den Hartog, Sea-grasses of the world, 1970, p. 68).Thanks to the kindness of Mr. A. Hansen I was able to study two sheets of original material of Hornemann’s taxon and as a result all the above-mentioned interpretations can be ruled out. One of the two sheets is marked ‘cotypus’ and is labelled ‘Zostera marina angustifolia, e sinu Othiniensi, Hornemann’, the labelling in the characteristic handwriting of Prof. J. W. Hornemann himself. The specimens mounted on this sheet are all extremely narrow-leaved Z. marina. The specimens on the other sheet are very similar, and were collected from the same place; the labelling, however, is in the handwriting of N. Hofmann Bang, who was a close friend of Hornemann and owned the manor Hofmannsgave near the type locality.

N2  - Halophila stipulacea (Forsk.) Aschers. is a sea-grass which is widely distributed along the coasts of the western Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. In 1895 Fritsch (Verh. Zool. Bot. Ges. Wien 45, 1895, p. 104) recorded the species from the Island of Rhodos in the Aegean Sea. This was the first record of the species from the Mediterranean. There can be no doubt that it penetrated the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal, which was completed in 1869. Although there are no early records of its occurrence in the Suez Canal, it is significant that it was the only sea-grass found during the exploration of the canal by Munro Fox in the autumn of 1924; at that time it was abundant in several localities in the canal. Forti’s record (Nuov. Giorn. Bot. Ital. 34, 1927, p. 714—716) of the species is the second for the Mediterranean; he reported it as being not uncommon in the Dodecanesos. I myself have seen specimens that were collected on Samos in 1924 and near Cape Matapan in 1955 (Den Hartog, Sea-grasses of the world, 1970, p. 260). In spite of the fact that the number of published records is still scanty, it is obvious that H. stipulacea is now well established in the Aegean waters. Further the species has expanded its Mediterranean area considerably, as is apparent from recent records from Malta (Lanfranco, The Maltese Naturalist I, 1970, 16—17, stencilled) and Cyprus.MALTA.

N2  - Recently a review on the Angiosperm ovule has been published by the well-known Indian botanist V. Puri (1970). In this review the author stressed the differences between Angiospermous and Gymnospermous ovules, and he refused to accept their comparability or common descent. In this respect Puri comes close to Eames (1961). Both authors tend to regard the ovules as complex emergences. Apart from the main theme, there is a striking passage in this review dealing with the Hugo de Vries Laboratory at Amsterdam. According to Puri in that laboratory facts are sacrificed for hypotheses (p. 10). In the following we would like to start with the facts concerned and present them in a more convincing way, and then ask some simple questions on the structure of the ovules in order to show just how little precise information is available. This lack of information has had the effect of producing many different hypotheses.Boesewinkel and Bouman (1967) reinvestigated the initiation of the single integument in some Juglandaceous ovules. In a histogenetic study they showed that the development starts with subdermal and is followed by dermal periclinal divisions. They also stated that the integument arises as two halves, or valves, which are free above but become fused below especially in later stages. Unfortunately, however, they failed to give an unequivocal demonstration of this paired development by means of some good photographs. It was this lack of proof that led Puri to reject the evidence. However, it should be reported that earlier Shuhart (1932) and Leroy (1954) had published the paired initiation of the integument lobes (in Carya spec. and Platycarya strobilacea resp.), and had given photographs of microscopic slides showing cross-sections of the distal part of the nucellus flanked by two opposite tips of the young single integument. In the present paper we present two similar photographs, one of Pterocarya fraxinifolia, the other of Engelhardia spicata. In addition two other ‘true to nature’ photographs are given, showing two developing ovules of Pterocarya fraxinifolia, as they can be observed directly under a stereo dissecting microscope at low magnification, after the young pistil wall is carefully removed. There is no escape from the fact that the integument in these plants grows like two fusing lobes. The hypotheses are a different matter.

N2  - Vegetative anatomy, fruit and seed structure, and pollen morphology of Hua and Afrostyrax (tropical West and Central Africa) are described in detail. The two genera have many anatomical characters in common (see anatomical family diagnosis on p. 182) but are sufficiently different from other families to justify the existence of the family Huaceae. Some characteristic features are discussed and the results of comparisons with representatives of about 50 families are reported. Afrostyrax is not related to Styracaceae, nor is Hua to Erythroxylaceae as had been suggested in the past. Sterculiaceae and Bombacaceae appear to have the highest number of characters in common with Huaceae of all the families compared. This supports the inclusion of Huaceae in the Malvales as advocated previously by several authors. Some original observations on the anatomy of a few of the families compared are included in the comparative part.

N2  - This work is the first of its kind in so far that it gives an account of the chemotaxonomy of a large family of plants and its implications on the taxonomy of that family. The ideas for this book were derived from a symposium, to which all the 19 authors contributed, ‘The Comparative Biochemistry of the Leguminosae’, which was held at the John Innes Institute, Hertfordshire.The first chapter, by V. H. Heywood, gives a ‘Systematic Purview’ of the family. Chapter 2—14 provide a description of the known distribution of both low molecular weight and macromolecular constituents. In several chapters the methods used are also extensively discussed. Often the information of the various chapters has been obtained by workers belonging to other disciplines than taxonomy, and little attention has been given to taxonomic methods. Several of the chapters lack a summary and a discussion of the taxonomic implications.

N2  - The written history of Haplolobus is still less than one century old. O. Beccari, the great Italian naturalist, was the first to collect a specimen of this genus, June 1866 in Borneo, the only Haplolobus ever collected in W. Malesia! He, too, was apparently the first to recognize this genus as separate from Santiria, probably in 1872, but he never published it and his annotation became forgotten in his herbarium in FI (see Husson  Lam, Blumea 7, 1953. 456). The first species were described in 1889 by K. Schumann (in K. Sch.  Hollr., Fl. Kais. Wilh. Land) under Santiria. Only in 1931 the genus was split off from Santiria and formally described by H. J. Lam. The first revision appeared in 1932 (H. J. Lam, Bull. Jard. Bot. Btzg III, 12, pp. 404—419). Later revisions were by Husson  Lam (Blumea 7, 1953, 413—458; the treatment by the present author in Fl. Mal. I, 5, 1956, 238—246, was in no part original but based exclusively upon this revision) and by H. J. Lam (Blumea 9, 1958, 237—272). In 1962, after his retirement as Director of the Rijksherbarium and Professor of Systematic Botany at Leiden University, Prof. Dr. H. J. Lam intended to revise Haplolobus anew, but circumstances prevented him from doing so.The repeated and urgent requests of Prof. Lam, who was my teacher, the availability of rich new collections from New Guinea, and the possibility to study anew the types of several of the older names thought to be completely lost in B but fragments of which turned out to be still extant in the Lauterbach herbarium in WRSL, were the reasons for venturing on a fourth revision in the course of 40 years. Looking back at this 4th revision I cannot but admit that Haplolobus is doubtless an extremely difficult genus. Much more good, that is fertile material from all over its area is needed before any reasonably satisfactory and stable revision can be written. The present one is in some points probably a small step forward, notably in the better delimitation from Santiria based not only upon fruit characters but also on flower characters, thanks to which more stable geographic conclusions could be drawn. Some other deviations from its forerunners will doubtless turn out to be steps sideways or even backward. The practical difficulties are treated more in detail in the notes under H. floribundus. In the present stage of knowledge it is still impossible to say more about the taxonomic position of the genus as a whole, nor on its inner structure, than has been done by Lam (1958 and before). The taxonomic and geographic isolation of H. beccarii remains a riddle, the taxonomy of the group around and including H. floribundus remains vague, and the resemblance of some species to certain species of Santiria or even Canarium, suggesting polyphyly, remains puzzling.

N2  - Though the embryo provides one of the main generic characters of Haplolobus, up till now nothing was known about its germination or seedling (blastogeny). That is why the first author, when revising the genus Haplolobus (Leenhouts, 1972) contacted Mr. J. S. Womersley, Chief Division of Botany, Department of Forests, at Lae, Papua and New Guinea, and asked him for either viable seeds, or seedlings. We are very obliged to him and to the Department of Forests for providing us with both, including herbarium and spirit material of seedlings and a herbarium specimen of the parent tree. The latter was collected under nr. NGF 49210 (Henty) at Markham Point near Lae, and could be identified as Haplolobus floribundus H. J. Lam ssp. floribundus group A. The seedlings were collected 8 weeks after being sown in the Lae Botanic Garden; they were preserved under nr. NGF 49275. It is a pity that the seeds sown in the Botanic Garden at Leiden did not germinate.

N2  - The four closely related taxa considered in this paper have all been referred to Metrosideros at some time.Nani Adanson is still generally treated as a section of Metrosideros Banks ex Gaertn. (nom. cons.) despite the objections of several earlier authors (Merrill, 1952; Rock, 1917; Valeton, 1901; Miquel, 1885). A comparison of the description of Nani in the present paper with that of typical Metrosideros (Dawson, 1970) shows that the two genera differ widely in many features. I agree with Merrill (1952) that the affinities of Nani he with Xanthostemon and further suggest that a detailed revision at the specific level may lead to their being merged. If such a merger takes place, then Nani would have priority over Xanthostemon, although a strong case for conservation of the latter could be made.

Bot. Soc. Fr. 12 (1865) 300 under the binomial Metrosideros elegans. The group has remained in Metrosideros since that time.So far as is known the group is restricted to New Caledonia. The species may occur at quite low elevations, but are most common between about 300 and 1,500 metres altitude in forest or shrubland.

Griseb., loc. cit. 119, occurs in South America remote from the main Australasian concentration of the subfamily Leptospermoideae. It is the only representative of the subfamily in the Americas.The species was first placed in Myrtus (Hooker and Arnott, 1833), later transferred to Metrosideros (J. D. Hooker, 1847), and was finally segregated as a new genus by Grisebach (1854). Grisebach (1.c., 120) described a second species, T. philippiana, which is now treated as a synonym of T. stipularis. Tepualia stipularis is restricted to southern Chile and southern Argentina in lowland to lower montane sites where, according to herbarium labels, it grows in open, often swampy forest including Nothofagus forest.

N2  - It has been suspected for some time that Tetrameles nudiflora occurs in the Cape York Peninsula region of Queensland. The late Mr. L. S. Smith (Queensland Herbarium) referred some sterile specimens to this species, but, as far as is known, he never saw fertile material from Queensland.Mr. G. C. Stocker (Forestry and Timber Bureau, Atherton) collected good fruiting material of this species in the McIlwraith Ra. (13°50' S, 143°20' E) in November 1971 (Stocker 820). This appeared to be the first collection of fertile material. However, subsequent discussion with Mr. J. G. Tracey and Dr. L. J. Webb (Rain Forest Ecology Section, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) revealed that they had collected flowering material from large leafless trees in October 1968 at Claudie River (12°43' S, 143°17' E) and in October 1969 at McIlwraith Range and Rocky River ( Webb  Tracey 8230A, 9293A, and 9746A). Inspection of the Webb and Tracey specimens revealed that they were in fact Tetrameles nudiflora. Field evidence suggests that two of the suites of specimens, i.e. Webb  Tracey 9293A and Stocker 820, were from the same tree on the western slopes of McIlwraith Range. The specimens all agree with the description of Tetrameles nudiflora by van Steenis (Fl. Mal. I, 4, 1953, 385).

N2  - Within the rain forests of New Guinea there are many small pachycaul treelets belonging to the Rubiaceae. Generally these are rare in occurrence and poorly represented in the herbarium, due in part to the problem of protecting rami- or cauliflorous flowers and fruits during routine processing and storage. All have a similar general appearance and are difficult to assign to a particular genus. Indeed, the generic limits and relationships of many have been in doubt since they were described and few have been re-investigated in light of more recent collections and ideas. Versteegia and Maschalodesme are two of the better known genera. These are considered from a taxonomic point of view together with notes on the wood anatomy and cuticular structures. The other genera are less well known and include Airosperma in the Alberteae and many problematic species and genera in the Psychotrieae. These are distinct from both Maschalodesme and Versteegia and are not considered in the present paper.

The significance of pollen characters for taxonomic subdivision is evaluated and it is concluded that the subdivision proposed by Niedenzu in 1892 agrees best with the pollen evidence. Pollen morphology does not yet provide any clear indications of wider affinities of the family, except in a negative sense.

N2  - As Capparis corymbosa Roxb. [Hort. Beng. (1814) 93 nom. nud. et Fl. Ind. 2 (1832) 569 ed. Carey] was a later homonym of Capparis corymbosa Lamk. (1785), an African plant, Decandolle in Prod. I (1824) 247—248 had proposed the new name of C. roxburghii for the former basing it on Roxburgh’s specimen in the Banks herbarium under the manuscript name of ‘C. aguba’. Incidentally, ‘aguba’ is also the vernacular name used by Roxburgh in his Flora Indica and this manuscript name was used only by Roxburgh before he described the species as Capparis corymbosa. De Candolle mentions of having seen a type specimen in the Banks Herbarium, now in the British Museum, but this specimen could not be traced. Subsequently Jacobs (1965) while monographing the Asiatic species of Capparis Linn., designed Roxburgh’s description and unpublished plate as type. This plate No. 158 in the Roxburgh Icones was then appointed as the type by Sundara Raghavan  Rolla S. Rao (1966) and for the first time reproduced in print.While recently studying the specimens of Capparis at Kew it was observed that two specimens referable to C. roxburghii DC. were mounted on the same sheet, the left one bearing the label Thwaites CP 2480 and the right one ‘Capparis aguba’ Herb. Roxb. Jacobs has annotated the Ceylonese specimen but possibly overlooked Roxburgh’s specimen. This specimen is undoubtedly one of Roxburgh’s collection, is fairly well preserved, and bears his earliest manuscript name of Capparis aguba. As one of Roxburgh’s specimens could now be located, the specimen in Kew herbarium bearing the manuscript name can now be definitely designated as the type. No alteration of botanical identity is, however, involved. Incidentally there is also another specimen labelled as ‘Capparis aguba Roxb.’ in the Komarov Botanical Institute at Leningrad which is readily identified as C. roxburghii only. Evidently this specimen has been acquired by the Russians from one of the lots through exchange or purchase in auctions. However, this specimen is in a rather poor condition and except that it was procured during Fischer’s period forming part of his herbarium no other data is available. From the smudged letters it appears that the specimen formerly belonged to Herb. Heyne before it was procured by Fischer.

A key to the species is given. Each taxon has been described and provided with its full synonymy. All specimens have been cited except in those cases where more than 5 collections were made in one partial area (country, province, district, or small island). A complete identification list will be issued separately. In this revision of Taccaceae 1 genus and 10 species are accepted; 8 species are restricted to Indo-Malesia (SE. Asia to the Solomons), 1 to tropical South America, and 1 species occurs from the tropical west coast of Africa eastwards to Easter Island in the eastern Pacific.Two new species have been described, one from Borneo and one from the Solomons and New Guinea, and one new combination has been proposed.The genus Schizocapsa and a large number of specific names have been reduced. The species synonymy is considerable and comprises not less than 49 specific epithets. This situation is due to the fact that some widely distributed species have proved to be very variable. The material which I had at my disposal was considerably larger than previous workers, especially Limpricht, had in hand. As a result of this rich material numerous locally described species could no longer be maintained.

Stearn at the British Museum, the latter suggested it to belong to the tribe Johnsonieae to which Jeanplong agreed, classifying it as a new monotypic genus Halongia, next to the New South Wales Alania.My attention was drawn to it through the figures provided in the paper published recently by Jeanplong, which strongly reminded me of Thysanotus chinensis, a widely distributed member of an otherwise Australian genus, occurring from northern Australia with gaps to Thailand and China. Besides, a new Liliaceous genus from Indo-China would be quite unexpected.

According to his introduction his field survey started in 1879 and resulted into a classification of vegetation zones (forest zones), mainly of the lowland, based on physiognomy and dominant species. In later years some other major proposals of the vegetation zonation were made. Honda (1900) distinguished also altitudinal zones, based on his survey on dominance, and provided it with the first vegetation map. Nakano (1942—1943) stressed the physiognomy combined with species composition, sociology, and succession but did not produce a map. Kira (1949) described the forest zones of Japan stressing the climax concept and correlating ecology mostly with temperature; he added a map. Miyawaki (1967) wrote a large book (provided with a map) on the vegetation of Japan in which the climax concept played an important role, as it did in the study by Suzuki (1966a) who partly tried to integrate actual vegetation with climax types, paying great attention to the sociological aspect; he gave also a coloured map. Miyoshi (1903) introduced in Japan the study of plant communities and some years later (1907) the study of ecology, and these two disciplines have been pursued by the research schools of his pupils, Nakano at Tokyo University, Yoshii at Tohoku University, etc. A large number of papers have resulted in these two fields of vegetation study, mainly published in the Botanical Magazine, Tokyo (Botanical Society of Japan, 1887—), Japanese Journal of Botany (Japan Science Council, 1922—), Journal of Japanese Botany (Tsumura Laboratory, 1926—), Acta Phytotaxonomica et Geobotanica (Kyoto University, 1932—), Ecological Review (Tohoku University, 1935—), Bulletin of the Japanese Society of Plant Ecology (Tokyo University, 1941—1943), Physiology and Ecology (Physiol.  Ecol. Publish. Ass., Kyoto, 1947—), Hikobia (Hiroshima University, 1950—), Bulletin of the Society of Plant Ecology (Tohoku University, 1951—1954), Hokuriku Journal of Botany or Journal of Geobotany (Kanazawa University, 1952—), Japanese Journal of Ecology (Ecological Society of Japan, 1954—), etc.Besides the papers in these journals, science reports of universities have contributed to the development of ecological studies in Japan. A historic review of plant ecology in Japan and basic concepts, principles, and methodologies of ecology was given by Numata (1953, revised edition 1967) and a very brief bibliography of the literature concerned was published in ‘Ecology’ (Numata, 1958).

N2  - In January 1971 Dr. Simon Jan van Ooststroom, senior botanist of the Rijksherbarium, retired on reaching the age of 65, having been on the staff since November 1934. Though this event will to a certain extent change, but not interrupt, his work, it is nevertheless worth commemorating, as he has so many contacts at home and abroad, all of whom have profited from his wide knowledge which he shared freely.He was born in Rotterdam in 1906, where he received his primary and part of his secondary education. He completed the latter in Schiedam and entered the University of Utrecht in 1924. He became the assistant of Prof. Dr. A. Pulle in January 1927. By chance he became interested in the genus Evolvulus and this led him to compose an excellent world monograph of this genus for which he was awarded his doctor’s degree in 1934 and which furthermore caused a life-long interest in the bindweed family, on which he became a most reliable authority, especially for the Indo-Australian region. Many papers emanated from these studies, culminating in his treatment (assisted by Dr. R. D. Hoogland) of the family in Flora Malesiana (1953).

N2  - Trimenia was first described by Seemann (1871) and based upon a single specimen from Kandavu, Fiji Islands. This specimen he had referred earlier in a preliminary list of Vitian Plants (1861) to a species of Weinmannia because ‘in habit this singular plant is so very much like some species of Weinmannia (Seemann 1871). He suggested it to belong to the tribe of Ternstroemieae DC. of Theaceae, ‘though the panicles are pluriflorous’. Bentham  Hooker (1880) did not share this view and although the systematic position was not certain as they said, they regarded it to have more affinity to Monimiaceae. Some time elapsed before Perkins  Gilg (1901) and Perkins (1925) placed the taxon definitely in the Monimiaceae as the tribe Trimenieae.Gibbs (1917) regarded this tribe to be a distinct family, Trimeniaceae, although she did not state the reasons for this decision. On the basis of more extensive material Gilg  Schlechter (1923) disputed this point of view; they postulated that the features upon which the diagnosis of the family was based were not clear and distinct enough to justify a separation between Monimiaceae and Trimeniaceae as distinct families, although it seemed clear to them that the Trimenioideae should have to be considered as a distinct subfamily of Monimiaceae. This subfamily should include four genera viz.: Xymalos, Idenburgia, Piptocalyx, and Trimenia.

N2  - In April 1969 I paid a visit to Ceylon for a week, allowing me to study for the first time the collections of the Department of Agriculture, Peradeniya (PDA), including Thwaites type specimens. My stay was made possible through the Smithsonian Flora of Ceylon Project.The study of Thwaites’ type material revealed some new facts affecting the synonymy of Ochna jabotapita L. and O. obtusata DC. It had previously come to my attention that materials distributed as O. moonii Thw. under number C.P. 1224 belonged to either O. obtusata (BM, BO) or O. lanceolata Spreng. (K, P) (see also the note on page 26 of my revision). I subsequently found that all three species of Ochna in Ceylon were represented on the sheet in PDA, obviously bearing Thwaites’ holotype. From this and accompanying sheets it is clear that the material belonging to O. jabotapita should in fact be designated as the holotype of Thwaites’ species. Consequently, the whole paragraph under O. moonii on page 30 of my revision should be transferred from the synonymy of O. obtusata to that of O. jabotapita. The phrase ‘excl. syn. O. quarrosa L. sensu Moon = O. jabotapita L. ’should be deleted. The type should be referred to as C.P. 1224 p.p. (PDA p.p. holo).

N2  - The new scheme of classification presented in this paper is based on the examination of all species in the family Thelypteridaceae which I have been able to trace in the Old World. I have gradually compiled a list of about 700 names (basionyms) and have examined type or other authentic material of all but a small proportion; and in the course of study of specimens in many herbaria I have noted about another 50 species which appear to be undescribed. I have attempted to re-describe all the previously-named species, noting characters not mentioned in existing descriptions, especially the detailed distribution of hairs and glands, including those on the body and stalk of sporangia, and characters of spores. It is probable that there remain some published names, not yet detected by me, which refer to species of the family, but I think there are not many.I have also made a study of all generic and infrageneric names which are typifiable by species of Thelypteridaceae, and in doubtful cases I have tried to clarify and fix the typification. As already reported in the second paper of this series (Blumea 18: 195—215), I have had the help of Dr. U. Sen and Miss N. Mittra in examining anatomical and other microscopic characters of some type species, and hope to present further information of this kind later.

N2  - In 1916 Merrill described a new monotypic genus of Gramineae, Ramosia, from the Philippines, recording one species, R. philippinensis, based on one single collection by Ramos, BS 23607, from Lake Pulog, Sorsogon Prov., Luzon, 27-8-1915, where the plant grew along the border of the lake, either in wet swampy places or in shallow water. Except for the type no other specimens have ever been mentioned, nor encountered during this study.Merrill could not place his new genus with certainty, comparing it with Panicum nodosum Kunth and Glyceria. In 1923 he placed it near Festuca and Bromus. The genus was not taken up by C. E. Hubbard (1934), while Pilger (1954) placed it provisionally in Festuceae—Melicinae. The late Dr. Jansen saw an isotype in Kew and noted in his MS ‘giving the impression of a small Centotheca’, postponing a decision.

N2  - Data are given on the taxonomy and ecology of the genus.Some New Caledonian species grow in or descend to the lowland. Details are provided on the distribution within New Guinea. For dominance of Nothofagus, and Fagaceae in general, it is suggested that possibly symbionts may contribute to this. Some notes are made on regeneration and germination in New Guinea.A special chapter is devoted to a discussion of dispersal which appears to be extremely slow, with the implication that Nothofagus indubitably needs land for its spread, and has needed such for attaining its colossal range, encircling onwards of New Guinea the South Pacific (fossil pollen in Antarctica) to as far as southern South America. Map 1.An other chapter is devoted to response of Nothofagus to the present climate. The possibility is envisaged that it could have grown along the border of the Antarctic Continent during a milder climate in the Cretaceous and Tertiary.The fossil record is ample, both by macrofossils and fossil pollen. Of the three pollen types, the brassii and fusca types are already found in the Upper Cretaceous in Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica, and in the Eocene in Fuegia the menziesii type being found hitherto not earlier than the Lower Tertiary. Table 1.No reliable Nothofagus fossils have ever been found on the northern hemisphere. There it is represented by its counterpart, Fagus, with which it forms the subfamily Fagoideae of the family Fagaceae. Macrofossils of Fagus are known from the Tertiary and possibly also from the Upper Cretaceous (on the northern hemisphere to a fairly high latitude. Map 1.Nothofagus is called a key genus for plant-geography because it meets the three criteria for safe biogeographical reasoning, viz. it has a sound taxonomy, an ample fossil record, and diaspores for which long distance dispersal is excluded.Fagoideae occupy a remarkable hour-glass-shaped bi-hemispheric range, with the contraction in the Malesian tropics. Map 1. Whereas even at present the largest amount of morphological diversity of Fagaceae in the world is found in Malesia (Lithocarpus: various sections, Quercus, Castanopsis, Trigonobalanus, and Nothofagus), with Castanea and Fagus in the Sino-Himalaya, it is likely that the cradle of Fagoideae was somewhere in the region stretching from Yunnan to Queensland. It is reasonable to assume that from this initial pre-Upper Cretaceous Fagaceous matrix Fagus emerged in the northern part and Nothofagus in the southern part, for which Queensland looks the most likely.It is shown that the evolution and spread of Nothofagus can be explained in an unforced way under the steady state principle, which implicates that certain oceanic areas in the South Pacific have been land in the Cretaceous or Early Tertiary.This north-south bi-hemisphere pattern of distribution is found in many groups, sometimes in the rank of family, sometimes in the lower rank of genus or even in rare cases of species. Ranges may be almost intact in the tropical-montane zone, as happens to be in Euphrasia which possesses a range almost replicating that of Fagoideae. Map 2. In others the tropical transition relicts are very rare or even absent. The rare ones are sometimes taxonomically highly interesting by being systematically isolated and showing unusual characters.It is advocated that the tropical montane representatives of this pattern of distribution have gained their range synchronously or almost so, as the series of opportunities enabling such ranges to develop is supposed to have happened only ‘once’ in geological time. This implies that taxa belonging to ‘morphologically advanced’ groups are of greater antiquity than formerly often supposed.The main conclusions have been framed in a number of theses (Chapter 13).

N2  - The members of tribe Passifloreae of the Passifloraceae are assumed to be originally all tendril-climbers. They have essentially axillary cymose inflorescences, and the vegetative ramification occurs always through the accessory bud. In tribe Paropsieae and Flacourtiaceae (mostly shrubs or trees, no tendril-climbers) the inflorescences are axillary, most likely essentially racemose, and the vegetative ramification is mostly through the axillary bud.The tendril-climbing neotropical genus Ancistrothyrsus appeared to belong to Passifloreae.Though the tribe Paropsieae remains to occupy an intermediate position between Passifloraceae and Flacourtiaceae, they can best be classified with the Passifloraceae.A new key is proposed for the distinction of both families and the genera of Passifloraceae.

N2  - There are seeds that, when cut in any plane, show a labyrinth structure (van Heel, 1970). This may be due to folding of the cotyledons (Burseraceae, Dipterocarpaceae), or to the presence of testa tissue within the seed. In the latter case the testa tissue may either be located in the endosperm only (‘ruminated seeds’ in Palmae, Annonaceae, etc.), or the testa tissue may interfere with the cotyledons. It is possible that in some cases the testa at first interferes with the endosperm, and later on, when the embryo has become larger, also interferes with the cotyledons (Corner, 1966, in some Palmae).In the case of testa tissue interfering with the cotyledons, there are probably two possibilities. Firstly the testa may be located between portions of folded and lobed, mostly flat, cotyledons — sometimes surrounded by a small amount of endosperm — (Kingiodendron, Erycibe, Argyreia, Neokeithia). Secondly the testa can be located in many crevices in massive cotyledons (Hernandia, Mangifera). However, it seems that a distinction among labyrinth-seeds will be rather arbitrary, as long as the precise ways of development remain unknown. It is very probable that different ontogenies may yield much resembling end-stages (Corner, 1966; van Heel, 1971; Periasamy 1962).

General pollen morphology is rather uniform and only one main type is present, which could be subdivided into 7 subtypes on minor differences in shape, aperture, and exine pattern. Intraspecific variability is present in some species. Morphological trends are established and related to the taxonomic subdivision. Taxa which are macromorphologically advanced appear to have developed also derived pollen subtypes.

N2  - In revising Myrtaceae Blume correctly concluded in 1849 that Psidium rubrum Lour, from Indo-China could not belong to that neotropical genus. He erected a new genus Macropsidium Bl., to accommodate it, adding at the same time the description of a second new species from the Moluccas.It is desirable to select one of these two syntypes as the lectotype of the genus. I have chosen the one described by Loureiro, which procedure deserves the merit of saving also the generic name Octamyrtus Diels (Bot. Jahrb. 57, 1922, 373) to which I believe Blume’s second species belongs. This leads to the following formal nomenclatural and taxonomic disposition.

N2  - A peculiar structural detail, occurring during the development of ovules, seems to have passed almost unnoticed till the present day. It concerns the distal rim of either the outer or the inner integument, which appears to be slightly lobed in the ovules of several unrelated plants. In a recent note (1970) I called attention to this feature.It is known from Juglans and Platycaria (Warming, 1878; Leroy, 1955; Boesewinkel and Bouman, 1967), where the single integument is two-lobed. Warming mentioned two more cases, namely Lagarosiphon and Symplocarpus; however, I cannot confirm his observations from dried material. I noticed it myself in Scyphostegia horneensis, in Caloncoba welwitschii, and in Sterculia alexandri. In these three species the lobes occur at the rim of the outer integument. To these can now be added Hernandia peltata. However, in that species the lobes occur at the rim of the inner integument.

N2  - Of the 5 genera mentioned in the title a revision is given of the species of the Malesian region. Critical notes are made on delimitation, subdivision, and/or distribution of Carissa, Melodinus, and Chilocarpus; Neokeithia is reduced to Chilocarpus which genus exhibits an unusual array of variation in fruit structure.Keys to the Malesian species are presented of Melodinus, Leuconotis, and Chilocarpus. The keys are followed by an enumeration of these species; each species is provided with a brief synonymy and an account of its distribution and ecology. Essential extensions of previous knowledge of distribution are documented briefly by citing select collections. Various reductions of species are made. In Melodinus 2 new species are described, in Leuconotis 1 new variety; in Chilocarpus 6 new species, I new variety, and 2 new combinations are proposed. An account of all specimens examined will appear in a separate Identification List.

N2  - During a study of species of Alternanthera Forsk. introduced in the Netherlands it was necessary to compare the Malesian representatives of A. ficoidea (L.) R. Br. ex Griseb. ssp. bettzickiana (Regel) Backer (Fl. Mal. I, 4, 1949, 91). The material under this name present in the Rijksherbarium, Leiden, proved to be heterogeneous, part of it belonging to another species.Dr. Van Steenis pointed out to me an article by Pedersen (Kurtziana 14, 1967, 437), where A. paronychioides St. Hil. was mentioned for Malesia, and showed me his correspondence with the author, where further details concerning this species were given. A closer study showed the unidentified specimens to belong to that species.

N2  - The intention of this serial of review papers covering the various branches of botany is firstly to offer the authors a freedom to express opinions and to speculate as widely as they dare upon future trends, and secondly to offer the classical- and modern-minded readers at least a possibility to dip into each other’s pages so that each may appreciate the other and learn ‘what it is all about’ (Preston, in the preface to Volume I).The present reviewers are engaged in the field of plant morphology and anatomy, to which the last paper of this volume belongs, namely the excellent contribution by P. B. Tomlinson on Monocotyledons (mainly arborescent forms). Tomlinson presents a lively picture of the ‘habit’, vascularization, inflorescence, etc. in these plants, which were much neglected by one-sided temperate approach during decades. He does so by adding many functional details and by always considering the development of these structures. Especially his scheme for the construction of the stem in the palm Rhapis presents a reliable demonstration based on exact observations.

N2  - The revision was undertaken because the latest monograph by Pax  Hoffmann, dating from 1912, did not provide a satisfactory key, and because since that time a very large amount of new material has been collected and several new species were described.In the present revision 12 species have been recognized, among which 2 are new; 7 names have been reduced to synonymy.One species (E. eglandulosum Pax  Hoffm.) is here for the first time excluded from the genus and from the Euphorbiaceae and was found to be conspecific with Sterculia macrophylla Vent. (Sterculiaceae).The variability of the characters used by Pax  Hoffmann for infrageneric and for specific delimitation appears to be far greater than formerly understood. This was already stressed by Corner (1939) in his review of the Malayan species. For example, the peltation of leaves has appeared to be constant in some species, but not in others. The same can be said about myrmecophily — ants inhabiting hollow twigs — which is constant in 2 species, but is facultative in 2 other ones. This mild form of ‘parasitism’ is encountered only from Celebes eastwards as far as the Solomons (doubtful in Fiji). The variability in number of cells of the ovary appears also to be more complicated than formerly accepted on the strength of observations in a limited number of specimens. The occurrence of stellate hairs, and of indumentum in general, has not emerged as important for taxonomy. Remarks on this are made under E. diadenum. The number of basal nerves and the occurrence and position of the glands is also liable to variation and is constant in a few species only.Because of the variability of characters indicated above, the affinity of the species is reticulate and does not allow the distinction of clear infrageneric taxa.A difficulty encountered is that either flowers or fruits of several species are not or inadequately known and that some species are known from one specimen only.Though in 1867 Teysmann  Binnendijk mentioned the occurrence of polygamy in E. moluccanum, a ♀ tree and a tree with ♂ and some bisexual flowers, their observation was never again recorded in literature. I have not been able to confirm their observation in the abundant material of this species at hand. However, I have found that two species, E. banghamii and E. ronaldii from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula respectively, possess bisexual flowers. Both are known from one collection only and more material must show the constancy of this feature which is almost unique in the Euphorbiaceae; recently it has also been recorded for two species of Aporosa by Airy Shaw. In collecting Endospermum one should always be aware of the necessity to preserve specimens with ♀ flowes and/or fruit, as sterile material or ♂ specimens are very difficult to identify. It is highly desirable that observations on variability and polygamy are made in the field or in botanical gardens.

N2  - This is the fifth volume in the series of reference books on the anatomy of the Monocotyledons edited by the former Keeper of the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew, Dr. C. R. Metcalfe. It is the second volume of which he is both the author and the editor, his first contribution being volume I on the Gramineae.The book starts with an introductory part with notes on techniques and materials, general considerations on morphology and anatomy of the family, and a discussion of the taxonomic implications of the anatomical findings. The bulk consists of descriptions of leaf, culm, rhizome, and root anatomy of 280 species from 90 genera. For each genus data from literature have been abstracted in a special section by Miss Mary Gregory. Taxonomic notes are also given for each genus.

N2  - A massive, expensive book, principally an atlas of small botanical drawings (line drawings, c. 10 by 6 cm, two to a page), each provided with the Latin and vernacular name, a concise 2—4 line descriptive note, and the use of the plant. A similar text is added in Japanese. Most pictures are reproduced at ½ nat. size. Species are arranged alphabetically within the families which are in turn arranged according to the Englerian system. Only Gymnosperms and Angiosperms are included. Prof. Corner is responsible for checking the names and the brief descriptive notes.The pictures were drawn by Prof. Watanabe during World War II for the Japanese Military Administration at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Two volumes of these drawings were already published in small octavo in 1945 at Singapore, one on Medicinal Plants, the second on Edible Plants. A selection of some 200 plates was also later published by Prof. H. B. Gilliland in his ‘Common Malayan Plants’ in 1958 (University of Malaya Press, Singapore). The present work embraces all pictures made by Prof. Watanabe, many unpublished before, with addition of a number not made at Singapore, amongst them several of rare parasitic and saprophytic species from Borneo and Celebes, Pandanus from New Guinea, and other interesting odds, even from Japan, the Bonins, etc.

N2  - On March 1st, 1971, Dr. Hermann Otto Sleumer, senior staff member of the Rijksherbarium, retired on reaching the age of 65 years. I have expressly omitted to say ‘from active service’, because his work has gone on uninterruptedly and he even had objections against spending one afternoon, on Febr. 26th, to celebrate this occasion with speeches and a reception in his honour. Also Mrs. Sleumer found it quite unnecessary and did not anticipate it with pleasure, but afterwards both told us that they had enjoyed it immensely.The story of the life of a scientist is to me always fascinating if it provides, apart from the plain facts of education, career, and bibliography, an insight also into the motives of his personality, the opportunities life offered to him, the challenges he had to meet, and the way he solved them or came to decisions. Too often the incentives and personal notes fail to come to the fore and consequently such so-called biographies fall short of a true life sketch.

N2  - A revision is made of the genera Hypnodendron and Braithwaitea. Mniodendron and Sciadocladus are reduced to Hypnodendron, Limbella is excluded from the Hypnodendraceae, and Dendro-Hypnum is considered to be not validly published. Hypnodendron rigidum Mitt. is transferred to Pterobryella. The species of Hypnodendron are grouped into nine sections. Five of these are monotypic, viz. Leiocarpos Dix. and four new ones: Lindbergiodendron (including H. arcuatum), Tristichophyllum (H. diversifolium), Mniodendropsis (H. milnei), and Pseudomniodendron (H. fusco-mucronatum). The circumscription of the family also needs revision, but has been maintained unchanged for the time being in the absence of information regarding assumedly related families.A number of morphological and other characters are discussed. Hypnodendron is thought to be of pleurocarpous descent; Meusel’s derivation of the growth-form of Hypnodendron from that of the acrocarpous genera Mnium and Philonotis is rejected. Rejuvenation takes place by means of basal innovations, and in a number of erect species also by distal ones. The umbellate and palmate fronds are assumed to have been derived from a pinnate type. The Hypnodendraceae are distributed in the Indo-Pacific and Australasian regions and in southern South America. Hypnodendron is centred in Melanesia and New Zealand. 26 species are recognized, 9 of which are divided into subspecies or varieties; 5 taxa are reinstated (H. colensoi, H. comatum, H. comosum var. sieberi, H. spininervium ssp. spininervium and ssp. archeri) and 1 is described as new (H. vitiense ssp. australe). Identification keys are provided, and for each taxon are given: synonymy together with pertinent literature and typification, misinterpretations and misidentifications, description, geographical distribution, ecology, and notes on various subjects. Each species is illustrated, and a list is given of specimens examined, mostly accompanied by a distribution map.

N2  - Up to the present Meliosma was subdivided into two sections, Simplices and Pinnatae. These taxa are shown to be artificial, and a new, less simple but more natural infrageneric subdivision is made, viz. into the subgenera Kingsboroughia and Meliosma, subdivided into the sections Hendersonia and Kingsboroughia, and Meliosma and Lorenzanea respectively. The old sections Simplices and Pinnatae have been reduced to subsections of sect. Meliosma. This new system is primarily based upon endocarp characters which were as yet unknown; it has appeared that the morphology of the endocarp shows very important features. In subg. Kingsboroughia the vascular bundle connecting pedicel and seed is situated outside the endocarp wall, which is considered the most primitive situation, whereas in subg. Meliosma it is enclosed within the endocarp. The endocarp types of the four sections, in the sequence mentioned above, show an increasing degree of specialization, i.e. an increasing degree of enclosure of the vascular bundle by the endocarp wall; the most primitive type is found in the Malesian sect. Hendersonia, and the most specialized one in the American sect. Lorenzanea. The latter does not occur outside the New World, whereas the other three sections are SE. Asian, sect. Kitigsboroughia and sect. Meliosma subsect. Simplices centering in SW. Central China, N. Upper Burma and Tonkin, and sect. Hendersonia and sect. Meliosma subsect. Pinnatae centering in N. Sumatra, Malaya, and N. Borneo; these areas are shown to be probable, primary centres of origin of the species of these groups. Subg. Kingsboroughia and sect. Meliosma have thus bicentric areas, which are considered homologous, hence suggesting a similar distributional history of the taxa involved. Similar bicentric areas are also found in some other, unrelated genera, and may be not uncommon.Subg. Meliosma is a common, widespread, diversified taxon, in contrast to subg. Kingsboroughia which has only three uniform species covering small and disjunct areas. It is demonstrated that subg. Kingsboroughia is a relict group, which was much more widespread in former geologic periods than it is at present. This is supported among other things by the transpacific disjunct distribution of M. alba which at present only occurs in SW. Central China and in S. Mexico (formerly known as two separate species which were never compared).The history of the distribution of Meliosma during the Tertiary period can be partly reconstructed with the help of fossil records of this genus, more than 40 of which have been evaluated, mostly on the basis of paleobotanical literature. It appears that most of these records, including endocarps and leaf-imprints, are reliable, especially those of endocarps. With the help of these it can be established that the four sections and the two subsections of Meliosma were already recognizable as early as the Lower Eocene. From that time on their distributional history can be more or less traced up to the present. It is very probable that during the warm Eocene sect. Meliosma entered America via Beringia (the reverse possibly holds for sect. Lorenzanea), whereas it is certain that sect. Kingsboroughia did so at a later phase of the Tertiary, when the climate was cooler and a forest of warm-temperate ecology covered a wide zone in the northern hemisphere. The Pleistocene glaciations destroyed most of this vegetation and consequently the area of sect. Kingsboroughia was reduced to a few small relict stations, of which the localities of the above-mentioned disjunct M. alba are the most remarkable ones.The taxonomic revision proper deals only with the SE. Asian sections of Meliosma; the American sect. Lorenzanea has been excluded. Up to the present the number of Asian species of Meliosma was estimated to be nearly 100, the number of names even being twice as much. Of these species only 15 are recognized here, and no new species have been described. A number of these are widely distributed, complex species, which can be subdivided into several subspecies. It appears that in all species these subspecies are isolated from each other, either geographically, or ecologically (by altitude or habitat). One special case of ecological isolation has been found, viz. between two different-sized subspecies flowering respectively in the undergrowth and in the upper tree storey of lowland tropical rain forest. Finally, evidence has been found that Meliosma is a self-pollinator, which would favour the origin and perpetuation of local races, and hence would account for the richness of forms in Meliosma species.

N2  - This revision is largely based on the gross morphology of the plants concerned. Four genera can be distinguished. In order to verify their delimitation also a wood-anatomical study was carried out, which supported their distinction. Furthermore, I tried to gain knowledge about their blastogeny, but this could only be recorded for three species. The genera have been redefined. Two keys to the genera are given, one based on gross morphology, another based on the wood anatomy. Within each genus a key is given to the species. The monotypic genus Schizoscyphus has been transferred to Maniltoa. In all, 28 specific names have been reduced and 34 are maintained; four new species and one new infraspecific taxon have been described. It has appeared that the enigmatic Cynometra polyandra Roxb. must be incorporated in Maniltoa and that Hardwickia pinnata Roxb. should be arranged in Kingiodendron. Otherwise no transfers of species from one genus to another appeared necessary. A full synonymy and description is given of all taxa, with their geographical range and, if available, notes on their ecology. Hutchinson’s opinion that the occurrence of hairs on stamens is a taxonomically important character in generic delimitation, could not be corroborated for the genera treated here.It has sometimes been claimed that the presence of a stipe under the ovary can be used for generic delimitation. Such a classification is not possible since this character varies in Maniltoa in which three species out of fourteen have a sessile ovary. A similar statement can be made about the unilateral fusion of the stipe and ovary base with the receptacle; in a single indubitable species of Cynometra, C. mirabilis, this is the case, in all other species the stipe is free from the receptacle. In Kingiodendron I found that the cotyledons are very strongly folded in the seed.

N2  - In about 10—15 % of the cases a sharp distinction between Atriplex hastata L., patula L., littoralis L., and glabriuscula Edm. is not possible, both in the field and in the herbarium. In order to establish the status of the ‘intermediates’ a karyological examination was undertaken of 95 samples collected in the Netherlands including both typical specimens and intermediates. It appeared that the specimens clearly representing A. hastata, littoralis, or glabriuscula are diploid (n = 9), but those representing A. patula tetraploid (n = 18). The ‘intermediates’ between A. hastata and patula are either diploid or tetraploid. Hence a sharp distinction between the latter two taxa is only possible on the chromosome number. A similar result was found for the ‘intermediates’ between A. patula and littoralis. It depends on the specific concept one adheres to whether these four taxa should be ranked as species; European botanists usually give them specific rank, their American colleagues infraspecific rank. Autogamy seems to be the rule in these species. This as well as the chromosome numbers found rule out the possibility of hybridization as an explanation for the occurrence of intermediates. I have strong doubts as to the artificial hybrids reported in literature because of the technical difficulties involved and apparently not solved. Special attention has been paid to possible characters to be derived from the leaves, the phyllotaxis, and the bracts. The variation in the leaves of the four species examined is overlapping. The same holds true for the phyllotaxis and the ripe fruits and fruiting bracteoles. An account is given of some abnormalities which have been found during the chromosome countings. An attempt was made to correlate morphological characters of the leaf, especially the leaf-base and leaf-index, and the chromosomes in A. hastata and patula. The results presented in the scatter diagrams show that, though on the whole there is a marked correlation between leafshape and chromosome number, no sharp distinction can be made. Finally a provisional key is given.

N2  - This is primarily a textbook for students, providing a synopsis of orders and families of Gymnosperms, Dicotyledons, and Monocotyledons native, naturalized, and commonly cultivated in Malaya and Singapore. It emerged from a syllabus prepared by the author in 1960. There is a brief introduction. The bulk of the work is taken up by the descriptions of orders and families, each provided with a succinct discussion. Of most families one species is figured, the figure consisting of a habit drawing with a diagram and flower analysis: obviously almost all are original. There is a key to the orders, within each order a key to the families, and appendix 2 gives a simple artificial key to the common families. Within the families there is mostly a key to most genera. Appendix 1 lists family names with their Malay and Chinese equivalents and the book is ending with a glossary, addenda, and an index.The work is extremely well produced and is very recommendable for students’ courses in systematy in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, Indo-China, and the Philippines. The main frame is also distinctly useful in a much wider area, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, S. China, Formosa, but of course these areas contain other genera and the species figured are there not often applicable as to available material for students. The price is for students rather prohibitive. However, a student edition will be out soon. The price of this will be M $ 20, just one third of the original price.

N2  - Hardly anything is known about the occurrence of sea-grasses along the Atlantic coast of the South American continent. There are a few records from the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia and only two certain records outside the Caribbean area. The Hydrocharitacean Halophila baillonis Aschers. ex Dickie in Hook. f. (sub nomine H. aschersonii Ostenf.) has been collected once, in 1888, near Pernambuco, Brazil (Setchell, 1934). The other record concerns the leaf-blade of a still unidentified Zostera species, washed ashore near Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1934 (Setchell, 1935; den Hartog, 1970, p. 96).Through the kind mediation of Mrs. F. M. Lindeman-Torgo, Utrecht, I received a sea-grass sample from South America. This appeared to consist of an undescribed species of Halodule. I am indebted to Dr. R. C. Bakhuizen van den Brink, Leyden, for rendering the diagnosis of this species into Latin.

N2  - In this treatise ‘De l’Ovule’ Warming (1878) remarked that although the borders of the integuments grow uniformly, very rarely a division into lobes can be observed. He mentioned Symplocarpus foetida (inner integument four-lobed), Lagarosiphon schweinfurthii (outer integument four- or five-lobed) and Juglans regia (two-lobed). Moreover he cited the report by some authors of an occasional occurrence of lobed integuments in a few more plants.More recently Leroy (1955) described bilobed single integuments in Juglans and Platycarya. Boesewinkel and Bouman (1967) demonstrated that these lobes arise as two separate primordia in Pterocarya and Juglans.

N2  - A comprehensive study of structure and floristics in a typical montane (2700 m) grassland/forest transition in Papua-New Guinea was made using a destructive technique involving complete removal of all woody species below 10 m, in a single belt transect. By this means the distribution of all tracheophytes in a dense transitional system was accurately determined, providing evidence that the transition was advancing over open grassland. Use is made of profile and plan drawings. The transition is described as a discrete community in terms of juvenile, mature, and senescent phases. A distinct group of transition species is recognized. The distributions of life-forms and a symbiotic relationship between moss-hummocks and transition species are discussed, and the role of fire in transition dynamics is briefly considered.

N2  - In the introduction to his work the author explains the need for Icones of Indian Algae. He mentions several old publications with excellent illustrations in colour of marine algae from other coasts, which have added considerably to the knowledge and wider appreciation of the organisms. ‘Phycologia Indica’, unfortunately, is inferior to most of these older works. This is not because the coloured plates are of inferior quality. Some of them are even perfect, like those of Sebdenia polydactyla (pl. 14), Halymenia porphyroides (pl. 17), Grateloupia indica (pl. 19) and Dictyopteris australis (pl. 34).I am critical on the following: In addition to these plates the author has copied ‘original and authentic illustrations of diagnostic value and anatomical interest’ for his work. I have looked for the original illustrations in literature and have found nearly all of them. This was not so easy, for Mr Srinivasan gives no references to any literature. Comparing these illustrations with the original ones I detected many errors. Nearly all the dimensions as given in the figures are wrong. In some cases they are even ridiculous, as in the case of Liagora erecta (pl. 16) where, according to the given dimensions, cells of more than 10 metres long are found! When comparing the drawings of cells of Gastroclonium iyengarii (pl. 1) with those in the original figure (by Mr Srinivasan himself) the cells seem to have grown to twice their original size.

N2  - This new hard-cover Flora of Barbados is in every respect a fine specimen of a local tropical flora. The black and white frontispiece is by Priscilla Fawcett, representing the ‘Barbados Pride’ (Caesalpinia pulcherrima).Concise in design, limited in consequence of the small space of the area concerned, hence restricted to a rather small number of species slightly over 600, this book dealing with Spermatophytes is of great value, supplying a long-felt need for a modern flora ‘by students, teachers, agriculturists, as well as by amateur botanists, whether residents or only visitors to the island’. It does not pretend to be more than it aims at: ‘to enable anybody with only a slight knowledge of botany to identify any wild Flowering plant he or she may come across’. Though devoted to the island of Barbados, the present work is surely of great importance for the recognition of the floristic composition of the numerous islets of the West Indies, most of them being small, with a flora to some extent agreeing with that of Barbados.

The former is a new species related to M. ternata but distinct by its leaves, involucral bracts and cypsela morphology. The latter is proposed as a replacement name for Mikania dentata G.M.Barroso, a later homonym of M. dentata Spreng. Line drawings and comments about conservation status are made for both species.

N2  - This volume covers entries from the letters Ph—Re of this Cyclopaedia, which next to entries on plants (457 in all) contains also entries on minerals and animal products. Plants are arranged alphabetically under generic names. The impression is that plants are more lavishly treated in detail than the two other categories which together cover only 28 pp. The other 7 volumes also contain mainly botanical information; 90 % of the total entries being botanical. The series is essentially a modem treatment of George Watt’s ‘A Dictionary of the Economic Products of India’, 1889—1893, 6 vols.; a very large amount of information from an enormous literature is digested in this modern account. General information is given on a fairly large number of genera which are potential economic plants for India. Of those genera of which species possessing useful properties (food plants, oils medicines, etc., etc.) are native or cultivated in India each species is cited with pertaining main literature, vernacular names a sketchy description, and extensive information on its useful properties and utilisation, with mention of pertaining sources.Of fairly many species there is either a botanical habit, drawing, photographs of seed, fruit, field habit, a transverse wood section, finished products, flow-sheets, monograms, etc. According to the introduction the accounts of many genera are written by specialists and used by experts, all in India. Under each genus are, besides the main fully treated species, other possessing unimportant uses often briefly quoted. The nomenclature seems to be up to date.

N2  - Mademoiselle Ly-Tio-Fane, intrigued by the history of the spice trade, not to say spice war, when the French and later the English tried to break the monopoly of the Dutch in the Moluccas, has written a new and valuable contribution on the man suggested by Pierre Poivre to continue his efforts to establish the spice culture in the Mascarenes in the second half of the 18th century. The book consists of reproduced or abstracted documents studied by the author in libraries and archives, preceded by an Introduction of 82 pages giving a clear summary of Poivre’s attempts, and of the difficulties encountered by Céré and French colonists in Isle de France (Mauritius) and Bourbon (Réunion). It relates of the animosities amongst the French, the doubted genuineness of the plant material imported from the Moluccas, on which not only Commerson but also a board of members of the Académie des Sciences in Paris had to testify. The supposed economic importance induced a sphere of hostility and intrigue. Although the original plan was to concentrate the cultivation of spice plants at Isle de France, the Minister of Marine decided that plants should be sent also to Cayenne, and Poivre’s successor as Intendant of the islands even wished to suppress the cultivation in the Mascarenes and to allow Cayenne to enjoy the spice monopoly.Poivre had established well-managed nurseries in his private estate ’Mon Plaisir’, Pamplemousses, Isle de France. When he repatriated to France in 1773, the estate was sold to the King, and Poivre intended to have Céré for the supervision of the garden, and especially of the spice nurseries. The new intendant, however, instructed one of his subalterns to look after the nurseries, and the latter in his turn delegated the job to somebody else. In a few years time the loss of plants was severe. It took Poivre and his protectors in Paris a paper war of about three years to get Céré appointed in 1775.

Species fully described there and extending into the area covered by the present revision are not dealt with at length again, in order to avoid redundance.The present treatment deals with the species of Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia, or, more precisely, the smaller Pacific Islands from the Palau Islands, the Marianas, and the Bismarck Archipelago in the West to Hawaii and the Marquesas in the East. The Volcano and Bonin Islands wil be treated with Japan, to which country they were recently returned; the Admiralty Islands are included in Flora Malesiana; New Zealand will be dealt with together with Australia; New Caledonia was the subject of a separate publication (Kramer 1967); no Lindsaeoid ferns have so far been found on the Tuamotus, Pitcairn, Easter Island, and other islands in the extreme East of Polynesia, nor on any atoll islands.

N2  - In the first paper of this series (Holttum, 1969) I gave a brief summary of taxonomic treatment of the family Thelypteridaceae in the present century, and stated that in my judgement no satisfactory subdivision of the family, as represented in the tropics of the Old World, had yet been achieved, the arrangements of Ching (1963) and Iwatsuki (1964) being in part inadequate because the authors were not sufficiently acquainted with the majority of species in the Malayan region and in the Pacific, which far outnumber those of mainland Asia.I have been attempting a complete survey of all species of Asia, Malesia, and the Pacific, and it has become evident to me that a study of a wider range of characters than those used in most taxonomic species-descriptions is necessary in order to distinguish individual species clearly, and in order to provide data on which the delimitation of natural species-groups can be based. Therefore an essential preliminary is a detailed study of the morphology of the type-species of genera already proposed, as these species control the application of generic names. Such a study should indicate the nature of the differences between the species which by accident have become the types of genera, and will also provide standards against which the distinctive character-combinations found in newly recognized species-groups may be judged. The most- important generic names for the Old World tropics are Thelypteris, Cyclosorus, and Ampelopteris; in connection with the last-named, its resemblance to tropical American species included in Goniopteris Pr. (as re-defined by Christensen) necessitates a detailed examination also of at least one species of that genus.

N2  - In 1948, W. B. R. Oliver described the new monotypic genus Plectomirtha, collected by G. T. S. Baylis in 1945 from a single tree on a small rocky islet of the Three King’s Islands off New Zealand. He placed it in the Anacardiaceae, a family hitherto absent from New Zealand. This aroused a certain curiosity both from a taxonomic and plantgeographic point of view, because it would be much intriguing if an endemic genus occurred there.This was the reason why Dr C. G. G. J. van Steenis asked Prof. G. T. S. Baylis from the University of Otago, Dunedin, N.Z., for original material to be able to elucidate this case. A fragment of the holotype, consisting of a few flowers and a leaf, conserved in the Auckland Institute and Museum, became available to our institute in October 1954 by the courtesy of Dr R. Cooper.

N2  - According to Hutchinson this is intended as a Companion or Supplement to the first volume of the 2nd ed. of his ‘Families of Flowering Plants’ (1959), which lacked room for notes on phylogeny or genera with outstanding characters. ‘These are now provided with illustrations of many plants of special morphological interest and economic importance, and which sometimes may lead to their identification (sic). Drawings of the type species of the type genus of most of the large families are also included. The illustrations are mostly my own work’. The illustrations, at once simple and carefully made, are a pleasure to the eye and interesting indeed as a large number either depict little known ‘aberrant’ genera or give in some families (Cruciferae, Leguminosae, Umbelliferae, etc.) an array of the perplexing variation in either habit or fruit type. There are no family diagnoses but in most families a short description is given of the type genus. The purpose of this is not clear as this need neither be characteristic of the family diagnostics, nor of value for phylogeny, being merely of value for nomenclatural typification. Also all family synonyms are given in footnotes. Their value seems doubtful in this type of book. The text amalgamating the figures contains some notes on phylogeny, but is largely devoted to particulars about the variation within the families, with notes on geography, on uses of particular plants, history of names of plants, ornamental and drug plants, contains not a few quotations and other anecdotical matter, several derived from the Botanical Magazine.Obviously, the text serves for a large part to fill the space between the plates which Hutchinson wanted to have published.

N2  - As explained in Takhtajan’s preface this book is not a mere translation of his ‘The origin of Angiospermous plants’ (1961, in Russian), but an entirely new book. I find this true and not true. Comparing it with the Origin (1958 translation of the 1954 Russian version) the essence of the new book was there given in a nutshell. In size, chapter subjects, argumentation, and bibliographic documentation, the work is very much extended and it makes very interesting reading indeed. The sequence of the chapters is logical, almost always leading to distinct synthesis. Properly it is a critical commented survey of many opinions — Takhtajan being clearly in complete command of the huge literature on the subject — but from which the author follows his own line of choice and judgement, accepting or rejecting with brief but clear comments. The whole argumentation is admirably concise and rouses admiration for covering this vast subject, comprising taxonomy, plant distribution, morphology, palynology, genetics, population dynamics, flower biology, anatomy, paleozoology, etc. Major questions are embodied in subsequent paragraphs: polyphyletism is rejected; ancestors must be sought among heterosporous ferns or fern-like plants followed by pteridosperms and certain gymnosperms, although direct ancestors cannot be indicated; the basal flower type of angiosperms was bisexual. Takhtajan attaches great importance to occurrence of plants in small populations, especially in mountain plants, facilitating chance variations and genetic drift, rapid spread of mutant genes, which is important for evolution. This entails that missing links are almost never fossilized. Micro-evolution is equalized with macro-evolution. Neoteny (on which Takhtajan devoted a former work) can lead to despecialisation through which phenotypic simplification the complexity of the genome remains intact; it may provide for a maximum phenotypic effect by a minimal genotypic change. Primitive wood structure of early Winteraceous angiosperms is understandable by neotenic origin. Evolution of angiosperms was not only rapid, but also discontinuous as a result of neoteny. Developing in the mountains ‘in many ..... small ..... populations ..... the earliest angiosperms found themselves under conditions most favourable to evolutionary radiation. And if we bear in mind that their evolution was closely tied to the evolution of insects and was based on the complex and peculiar mechanism of mutual selection, then the extraordinary speed of their initial differentiation becomes even more readily understandable.’ Protection of the ovules arose as a selection against damage by ‘early pollinating insects’; this made simplification of their structure possible which led to smaller ovules (loss of thickened integuments, sclerotesta, etc.) and enabled the angiosperms to observe the greatest economy of material in construction of the ovules and ♀ gametophyte, and it also made possible the perfection of the process of pollination. ‘The acquisition of the stigma was undoubtedly a very great event in the evolutionary history of seedplants.’ ‘The primitive insects searched for pollen (beetles), nectar searching ones were a further perfection; this again led to a very great advance in cross-pollination; and as a corollary to a greatly increased rate of evolution, which still continues.’ ‘Isolation of a population is well known to be a prelude to the formation of a new species.’ The question of the hypothetical reconstruction of the first flowering plants is approached by the ‘hypothetico-deductive method’. Knowing the basic evolutionary pathways of angiosperms and the main lines of specialisation of their organs and tissues, we may by extrapolation extend these lines mentally into the past to the lowest possible level of specialisation’, but somewhat further on he writes ‘This reconstruction of the ancestors of the living angiosperms depends on the truth of the assumption that they combined in one plant all the most archaic characters that are now found distributed among the living fossils.’ I have italicized in the citations two words that are in contradiction; furthermore I would like to point out that whereas each plant we know possesses both primitive and derived characters, we cannot make an exception for an ancestral plant; one which would contain all the archaic characters must logically be an idealized fiction.

N2  - The primitive woody Angiosperm family Winteraceae is centred in the southwest Pacific, has an outpost in Madagascar (1 species), and a section of Drimys (4 species) in the New World. Pseudowintera is restricted to New Zealand, the Old World section Tasmannia of Drimys extends from the Philippines to Tasmania.Since A. C. Smith’s review of the family in 1943 about ten times as much material has become available and it appears that the taxonomy of the section Tasmannia is far more complicated than it seemed to be in 1943. This induced me to make a field study in New Guinea and to pay special attention to its morphology in the hope of finding additional criteria. On this basis the Australian species of Drimys could be better defined but the characters of the New Guinean taxa (Smith: 29 species) proved to be highly unstable.It was found that in the section Tasmannia the stomata are occluded by waxy plugs. The structure of the inflorescence is described and compared with that in section Drimys. In the flower two zones are distinguished. In the lower zone the floral appendages are arranged in (sub)opposite pairs, in the higher zone they are arranged according to the space available at the greatest possible distance from a focus of the floral apex which I termed ‘activity centre’; this centre often does not coincide with the ‘topographical apex’. The tilt of the floral apex appears to influence the arrangements as well. Shifting of determination factors in relation to the available locations on the floral apex is assumed to play an important role.As for the specific delimitation, the New Guinean material appeared to be the crux. The very heterogeneous material did not show correlated discontinuities in characters, which made it impossible to reach a division into species. The variability of the resulting very complex species Drimys piperita is described with the aid of a non-taxonomic subdivision, the units of wich are called ‘entities’. Field studies revealed that local populations are often very stable, but the morphological discontinuities between such local populations are obscured by material from other localities. It is supposed that vegetative propagation as observed in the field, combined with incidental cross-breeding, may be of importance in establishing such a situation.In Australia besides D. piperita four other species can be distinguished.The sections of Drimys are maintained, although Ehrendorfer c.s. and Smith proposed raising them to generic rank.In Pseudowintera the arrangement within the inflorescence is spiral, not decussate as described earlier, and a terminal flower is present. Minute hairs on bracts and young leaves, the mode of opening of the calyx cupule, and details of the lower leaf surface are used as a new set of specific characters. The fact that about twenty per cent of the specimens show varying combinations of specific characters is thought to be caused by hybridisation.

N2  - The floral and vegetative anatomy of the closely allied guttiferous genera Cratoxylum (Indo-Malesia) and Eliaea (Madagascar) is described. Although the two taxa have many features in common, differences are substantial enough to recognize them as distinct genera, as appears from the following survey: Cratoxylum Ovary with 12 or more ovules Ovary with 3(or 4) incomplete true septa Styles and filaments glabrous Secondary xylem with scarcely pitted fibres Vessels solitary and in radial multiples Silica bodies present in ray cells of wood Eliaea Ovary with 6(—8) ovules Ovary with 6(or 8) incomplete septa, three being true, three false Styles and filaments mostly villous Secondary xylem with densely pitted fibretracheids Vessels almost exclusively solitary Silica bodies absent The vascularization and insertion of the hypogynous scales in both genera favours the view that these structures may be interpreted as staminodial derivatives. In some species of Cratoxylum a further differentiation into taxa of lower rank is suggested by the presence or absence of abaxial epidermal papillae on the leaves; this is related to geographical distribution. Floral and xylem specialization of Cratoxylum and Eliaea are discussed. The xylem structure of Eliaea shows more primitive features than that of Cratoxylum, but the flowers seem to be more specialized. The possible implications of these findings for plant geography are discussed.In Cratoxylum the section Isopterygium (C. arborescens and C. glaucum) is very different in its wood anatomy from the other representatives of Cratoxylum. This difference (concerning parenchyma distribution) is correlated with the evergreen habit in the section Isopterygium. The other sections of Cratoxylum are deciduous. A comparison with some data from literature about other groups with deciduous and evergreen members is made.

They are as follows. 1. Diospyros addita Fletcher, Kew Bull. (1937) 386. — Type: Put 3109 (K, ABD). Is reduced to Vatica philastreana Pierre (Dipterocarpaceae). The fruit is shallowly three-lobed and has a persistent five-lobed calyx. It contains a single large seed the bulk of which consists of four massive cotyledonary lobes. Fletcher mistook the cotyledonary lobes for four separate seeds.

N2  - In continuation of a former study on the ‘Elevation Effect’ in the Swiss mountain flora (Backhuys, 1968), the distribution of six Taraxacum species in Switzerland was examined in detail. This was enabled by the preceding monographic study by J. L. van Soest (1969).The interesting point was to compare species of one genus with a common dispersal mechanism. Data on the vertical distribution are provided in table I and diagrams 1—6.It was found that all six species show an elevation effect which varies from 200—750 m. In five species this range is as narrow as 500—750 m. See table II.It is concluded that in spite of the very obvious dispersal mechanism (parachute-achenes) the species are apparently not capable to colonise ‘mountain islands’ the summit altitude of which is situated between the lowest known locality and the lowest mountain island on which the species concerned is found.These data support the view that the elevation effect is a plant-geographical rule of universal validity for mountain plants.

In random testing they proved to be reliable, as are the accurate descriptions.

N2  - Previous molecular phylogenetic studies indicated expansion of Breynia with inclusion of Sauropus s.str. (excluding Synostemon). The present study adds qualitative and quantitative morphological characters to molecular data to find more resolution and/or higher support for the subgroups within Breynia s.lat. However, the results show that combined molecular and morphological characters provide limited synergy. Morphology confirms and makes the infrageneric groups recognisable within Breynia s.lat. The status of the Sauropus androgynus complex is discussed. Nomenclatural changes of Sauropus species to Breynia are formalised. The genus Synostemon is reinstated.

N2  - Niedenzu (in E.  P., Nat. Pfl. Fam. 3, 7, 1893, 87—89) included the following genera in his subtribe Metrosiderinae: Metrosideros, Spermolepis2 (= Arillastrum), Cloëzia, Lysicarpus, Tepualia, Syncarpia, Xanthostemon, Pleurocalyptus, and Tristania. The Metrosiderinae was distinguished from the Leptosperminae by usually having flowers in axillary groups, not solitary, and from the Eucalyptinae by having narrow, not broad based petals.A preliminary survey of the above genera indicates that Niedenzu’s subtribe Metrosiderinae is not a natural group and in this paper, the first of a series, a critical examination of reproductive features of Arillastrum Panch. ex Baillon leads to the conclusion that this genus, notwithstanding its narrow petal bases, is most nearly related to the genera comprising Niedenzu’s subtribe Eucalyptinae.

Most characters of D. taylorii appear to be intermediate between those of the other two species; a few characters represent combinations of those of the two other species; one character is not shared by the other species. From this evidence it is supposed that D. taylorii is a hybrid. This suggestion is sustained by the history of the specimens on which D. taylorii is based. An attempt to count chromosomes of D. taylorii and D. grandiflora failed, probably due to the unsuitability of the fixative for this purpose.

N2  - The Rijksherbarium received this finely illustrated book from Mr. Anghelos N. Goulandris, chairman of the Board of Governors of the Goulandris Botanical Museum, Kifissia, Greece. In the accompanying letter Mr. Goulandris wrote that this is the first publication of the recently (1963) founded Museum, an institution which has the object of promoting and assisting plant taxonomic activity and research in Greece.The beautiful botanical paintings were made by Mrs. Niki Goulandris, of Athens. They depict many Greek endemics but also species of a much wider distribution. All illustrations are, however, as the author’s introductory note says, of outstanding native wild flowers, especially collected for this purpose by the late Dr. C. N. Goulimis, who also drew up the text, which afterwards, after his death, was checked over and supplemented or occasionally rewritten by Dr. Steam of the British Museum (Natural History). Descriptions of the depicted species have been omitted with a few exceptions. These descriptions and further data relating to most of the species are to be found in the well-known flora’s by Halacsy, Hayek, and Rechinger. Of species described since the publication of these standard works, the original descriptions have been reproduced in the book, so that, as Dr. Steam writes ‘the present work thus provides a kind of illustrated supplement to these’. From a scientific point of view the value of the book is especially qualified by the number of species not previously depicted in botanical literature, and by the detailed data on the distribution.

N2  - Only two species of Gastonia occur in Malesia, but each has a complex taxonomie history. The species which became known first, G. papuana Miq., is evidently an uncommon plant of coastal and lowland forest, but with a very wide range. It has been collected only once, or at most a few times, from each of many islands of the Malayan Archipelago and once from the mainland of the Peninsula. Most of these collections were made in the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. Only in western New Guinea has this species been collected in more recent times within our area. The distribution of this species shows several disjunctions, the most striking being that between West Irian and its only known locality in the extreme east of the Solomon Islands. It is interesting that this gap corresponds with the distributional range of the second species, G. spectabilis (Harms) Philipson, which overlaps that of G. papuana only in the west of New Guinea (fig. 1).The widely dispersed range of G. papuana has resulted in its being described as several distinct species from different parts of its range. It was first named in 1863, when three names appeared in two genera. Miquel (1863) applied the names Tetraplasandra paucidens and Gastonia papuana to this species, and Teysmann and Binnendijk (1863) described it as Tetraplasandra eupteronoides. I am grateful to Professor van Steenis for information on the sequence of publication of these names. Miquel’s publication was issued on 2 July 1863 (Stafleu, 1967). A report in volume 27 of the ‘Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië’ states that volume 25 was issued in six instalments, the first of which appeared in 1862. The five remaining parts appeared in 1863. Professor van Steenis has examined the publication and concludes that page 416, on which the name T. eupteronoides appeared, belongs to the final instalment, and must therefore have been issued late in 1863, and in any event later than July. For this reason, Miquel’s names take precedence over that of Teysmann  Binnendijk. Of Miquel’s two names, I have chosen to use that which he placed in Gastonia. In this way the need for a new combination is avoided. As can be seen from its synonymy this species was described from other islands by subsequent authors.

N2  - The six genera Gastonia, Tetraplasandra, Reynoldsia, Munroidendron, Peekeliopanax, and Indokingia form a natural complex distributed from East Africa to the Marquesas and the Hawaiian Islands. The characters which have been thought useful in distinguishing these genera are re-examined. The distinction between Gastonia and Tetraplasandra is redefined, emphasis being placed on the radiating stigmatic arms in the fruit rather than on pleiomery of the stamens. On this basis Tetraplasandra is confined to the Hawaiian group. The monotypic genera Peekeliopanax and Indokingia are reduced to synonymy under Gastonia, which thus comprises all species of the complex west of Samoa.

N2  - The pollen morphology of 18 out of 22 species of the genus Lepisanthes, as recently revised, was studied. General pollen morphology is rather uniform, but taxonomically significant differences exist in shape, relative length of ektoapertures, endoaperture development, and in the sculpture of the tectum. Detailed descriptions are presented and special attention is given to intraspecific variability. 10 Pollen types are recognized, most of which are linked by transitions. Morphological trends are established and the extent to which they indicate natural relationships is evaluated. In subgenera Lepisanthes and Erioglossum a less evolved but more variable pollen morphology is present, while in subgenera Otophora and Aphania derived pollen types occur, which agrees well with macromorphological evidence. Subgenus Erioglossum appears pollenmorphologically closely related to subgenus Lepisanthes. Subgenus Aphania can, both macro- and pollenmorphologically, be derived from subgenus Otophora. Within Lepisanthes tetraphylla close parallels exist between macromorphological and palynological interpretations of natural affinities between the numerous races. Lepisanthes fruticosa, in contrast, shows on both counts rather wide and continuous intraspecific variability. Also in Lepisanthes senegalensis continuous pollenmorphological variability is present, but here a clinal pattern can be detected. In general, geographically isolated or endemic forms in Lepisanthes show a tendency to develop deviating pollen types.

Though this in no way, I trust, means an interruption in the scientific work of Mr Kern, it provides a welcome occasion to dwell upon his noteworthy career and scientific achievement.Born December 21st, 1903, at Nijmegen, he intended to be a teacher, for which he obtained the diploma in 1922 in his native town. This was soon followed by additional diplomas, for head-teacher in 1927, for French in 1928, and for German in 1933, testimonies of his ambition, energy, and capability to develop his knowledge for educational purpose. From 1922—1927 he was an elementary school teacher at Mill, 1927—1940 at Vlaardingen; 1940—1942 he served as head-teacher at Dedemsvaart, 1942—1946 at Gorinchem, 1946—1949 at Nijmegen.

N2  - My revisional work in the Flacourtiaceae confronted me with the genus Homaliopsis Sp. Moore, J. Bot. 58 (1920) 187, from Madagascar, based on a Forbes collection without locality, and never recollected. The genus was placed in the Flacourtiaceae by Sp. Moore himself, and, with reservation, included in its tribe Homalieae by Gilg in E.-P., Nat. Pflfam. 2nd ed., 21 (1925) 424; it has remained there in Perrier's revision of the family for Madagascar (Fl. Madag. Fam. 140, 1946, 119) and still in Hutchinson, Gen. Fl. Pl. 2 (1967) 217.Already the study of the original description which speaks of leaves with pellucid dots and a simple (not partite) style raises doubts whether Homaliopsis really belongs to the Homalieae, or even, by the mention of stamens arranged in phalanges (not alternating with glands) and almost opposite leaves, to the Flacourtiaceae at all.

These may bear either marginal or superficial unicellular hairs, or both, or perhaps in rare cases none; the hairs may be acicular, or capitate, or spherical and glandular.

N2  - Lepisanthes in the broad sense accepted in the present revision comprises several genera and even two tribes as they were defined by Radlkofer in his Monograph of the family (Pfl. R. Heft 98). An argumentation for this new delimitation has been given in the first part of Chapter II. By analysing the phylogeny of a few characters, an effort has been made to make the mutual relationships within Lepisanthes more clear and to give a synthesis of it (Chapter II, parts 2 and 3). The taxonomie part proper is preceded by three chapters on resp. L. tetraphylla (Chapter III), L. fruticosa (Chapter IV), and L. senegalensis (Chapter V), the three most complex species. Though the treatment is somewhat different, all three chapters are intended to give a picture of the variable complex as a whole as well as an analysis of its elements and an argumentation in defence of the acceptance of such wide limits.The present revision of Lepisanthes is primarily intended as a precursor to the future treatment in the Flora Malesiana. For that reason the species are not all uniformly treated in the Taxonomic part (Chapter VI). The synonymy and typification are complete for all taxa; the genus and the infrageneric taxa are described in full, and the keys to the species are complete. Complete literature and descriptions are given for those species which are exclusively or mainly non-Malesian; in the case of new Malesian species only the Latin diagnosis based upon the type specimen has been given. Under all species or infraspecific taxa all specimens studied are cited except (1) when the number of collections was very large and many of these had already been cited by Radlkofer, either under the same name or under one or more synonyms, and (2) for those regions of which more than 5 collections were seen; in the latter case the number of collections studied has been mentioned. No index has been given to all collections seen; they will be included in a future issue of the Identification Lists of Malaysian Specimens on all Sapindaceae.

Quisumbing and the late Dr E. D. Merrill. Unfortunately, the material was not available when Mr A. W. Exell revised the Combretaceae for the Flora Malesiana (ser. I, vol. 4: 548. 1954) and it remained unpublished.After a close study with Mr Exell’s revision, and by comparison of all Malesian species represented in the Rijksherbarium, it proved indeed to be a new species. Unfortunately its fruit is still unknown.

Pollen grains of Sarawakodendron and six related genera, consisting of twenty-nine mostly Malesian species, have been examined and recorded. 3. The result of pollen study on Kokoona and Lophopetalum agrees with the generic delimitation based on gross morphology. 4. At least four pollen types have been found in the genus Lophopetalum on examination of all the species involved. 5. The pollen of Sarawakodendron shows a great resemblance to that of the related genera Xylonymus and Kokoona. 6. The pollen of Hedraianthera and Brassiantha resembles that of Sarawakodendron, Kokoona, and Xylonymus in aperture configuration, but differs in sculpture and shows in this respect similarity to the pollen of the African Salacighia. 7. In Kokoona coarseness of reticulate sculpture appears correlated with anther characters. This genus can also be easily distinguished from Lophopetalum by its single pollen grains. 8. Parallels are found between the pollen types in Lophopetalum and those in Hippocratea (sens. str.).

N2  - Of 75 regions, some continental and others insular, the diversity as expressed in the number of Phanerogam genera is compared.As could be expected it is found that richness in both continental and insular regions is positively correlated with size and with proximity to source areas. In comparable continental and insular regions the former are always richer; increase in the number of genera with increasing size is stronger in the former. There are various factors disturbing the relations between size/diversity and isolation/diversity. The role of these factors, such as climate, age, topography and the like are discussed.It is shown that isolated islands are not always poor (New Caledonia, Fiji, Lord Howe I., Rapa, etc.). On the other hand the poverty of islands (e.g. New Zealand) need not be primarily due to the distance from a source area but may be caused by impoverishment of an originally rich flora.Once isolated, an island flora is much more subject to losses than a continental area where the losses in general may be readily replenished.It would be wrong therefore to conclude on the basis of poverty that an island has always been as much isolated as it is at present.Not only are isolated islands in general poorer in genera, there are also less genera per family than in a comparable continental area. This is shown to be caused by a preponderance of families represented by a single genus in the former.

Being connected closely with the Icacinaceae of South and Southeast Asia on the one, and with Australia and the Pacific on the other side, and in part even with those of Africa inch Madagascar, it has been necessary to study the respective materials too, without, however, to perform a complete revision of all Icacinaceae in these parts of the world. This was the less necessary, as R. A. Howard (1940—42) already has revised part of the genera concerned. The elaboration of the family in several local treatments has much contributed to our knowledge of the family for Africa.Of the genera formerly included in Asiatic-Malesian Icacinaceae Leucocorema Ridl. has been transferred to Trichadenia Thwait., Matpania Gagnep. to Bouea Meisn., and Petitastira Ridl. to Dichapetalum Thou.

N2  - Professor Holttum’s book on the ferns of Malaya has been regarded a major contribution to the systematics of ferns. It is the result of several decades of active study by an expert botanist. Based on both living and dried material, it goes far beyond that what is generally found in a flora. There is still no general agreement among pteridologists as to the division and status of the major groups, their nomenclature, etc. and the comments Holttum added to most of the larger groups, often implying original ideas, are of particular interest. Besides, detailed ecological information is provided for nearly all the species involved.It is therefore not surprising that after a second printing in 1960, the book became soon out of print again. Another unchanged reprint was unsatisfactorily as in recent years several species new to Malaya were discovered (mainly thanks to Mrs Allen) and important new information on several groups has become available. A revision of the book seemed recommendable but fell outside the scope of the author’s present activities.

These cones are of interest because of their small size, particularly compared to the other species of the genus where the pollen cone usually reaches several centimetres in length.The fully mature cone of F. papuanum is c. 5 mm long and 2 mm in diameter. It appears both in terminal and lateral positions; when terminal it is subtended by a few sterile scales, when lateral by a larger number.

N2  - In the introduction a brief historical review is given of the more important earlier treatment of the genus. In chapter 2, covering morphological observations, I have also inserted remarks on the systematic value of certain features. The axillary (and in sect. Neossia, nodal) hairs have often been interpreted as representing stipules. I have tried to advance arguments in order to show that their stipular homology is most unlikely. It is confirmed that there is no essential difference between the morphological structure of the inflorescence and that of the vegetative portion of the plant. There is no unanimity of opinion about the interpretation of the 2-whorled perianth; the outer series is often accepted to be of a bracteal nature. Von Poellnitz refers to the outer whorl as ‘Involukralblätter’, Legrand names them ‘pseudosepalos’. However, the fact that in subg. Portulaca, with flowers in capituli, the whorls are inserted at the same height on the receptacle which is adnate to the basal part of the ovary, and the fact that below the receptacle there are generally two true bracts, make it almost certain that such assemblage is a contracted triad, with one developed flower and 2 ‘bracteoles’. This cymose nature is further sustained by the species of subg. Portulacella in which true cymes occur. In chapter 3 it is argued that the present wide distribution of several species, e.g. P. pilosa, P. quadrifida, and P. oleracea, is mainly due to man, by his transport and cultivation. Such species behave often as ruderals and adventives beyond their original country. Of some of these the genuine native country is for these reasons even unknown or very uncertain, e.g. that of the diploid P. oleracea; its cultivated strain is hexaploid but this is also found as a ruderal and adventive. P. pilosa s. l. may be originally of Australian origin, judging from the geographical area of its nearest allies and the very large degree of variability it exhibits in Australia. Self-pollination is obviously the rule in Portulaca as well as in Talinum, another genus of the same family; this may even be prevalent in the entire family. This implies, and explains, a profuse occurrence of more or less pure lines (local populations or races) in nature which keep constant in details (e.g. the sculpture of the testa). For this reason, not a few of these have been distinguished as (micro) species by former authors. Some of these characters are more conspicuous in the field than in the herbarium. For example, I have grown two of such lines of Talinum paniculatum which throughout their range differ (in living state) constantly in the following three minor characters: testa minutely tubercled or smooth, panicles narrowed or not, fruits red or yellowish. Such characters would seem to be determined merely by a few genes, and do not or hardly deserve systematical recognition as formal taxa. They are just on the border of herbarium taxonomy, and can only be solved, as to their genetical basis, by experimental taxonomie work. Only when more and clearer characters occur combined in complexes I have accepted these in a formal taxonomie hierarchy, e.g. in P. pilosa. On the whole I have felt induced to be rather conservative in accepting good species, but many are reduced to synonymy or to infraspecific rank. In chapter 4 the subdivision of the genus is discussed. It appeared that those of von Poellnitz (1934) and (to a lesser degree) Legrand (1953, 1958) are unsatisfactory. I have framed a new, more simplified, subdivision reflecting my ideas. Some taxa could not well be understood and have been referred to under the genus.From the morphology and taxonomy it is concluded that the ancestral lineage of the genus is in Australia, which fits in with the general geographical configuration of the family which is predominantly a southern hemisphere group. Chapter 5 contains some notes on typification, which has been effected as much as possible, mainly by lectotypification. Unfortunately, some types proved to be untraceable. The area covered in this account ranges from India eastwards through Indo-Australia as far as the Central Pacific. I have refrained from citing specimens examined. A list of these will be published separately as an Identification List.In the systematic treatment full synonymy, descriptions, and keys are given to taxa, both species and infraspecific entities. Not all names could be placed, either by absence of types or lack of material. These are listed at the end; tentative suggestions are given to their proper identity. The number of species distinguished in Portulaca has varied enormously. Linnaeus had only 2 species, P. oleracea and P. pilosa; Index Kewensis lists c. 600 names. In this century von Poellnitz has described in his papers precursory to his monograph described many dozens of new species. For a large part he withdrew these again and sunk them into synonymy in his monograph of 1934, in which he accepted in all 104 species. Subsequently c. 30 new species were added by various authors. Legrand (1962) in his revision of the American species reduced quite a number of von Poellnitz’s species, still maintaining 62 species for the New World. He distinguished, however, a large number of varieties reflecting the variability of these species. More than 50 of his species belong to subsect. Stellulato-tuberculatae, mainly comprising the P. pilosa complex. In my opinion this complex consists of only one compound species, in which I have distinguished 8 subspecies for Indo-Australia. In America P. pilosa is obviously still more variable. I estimate that the entire genus consists of not more than 15 good species, mainly in the Old World, viz. 4—5 in subg. Portulacella, 3(—5) in subg. Portulaca sect. Neossia, , 2(—7) in sect. Portulaca subsect. Portulaca, and possibly only 2 in sect. Portulaca subsect. Stellulato-tuberculatae. The two Linnean species, P. pilosa and P. oleracea, possess, in that sequence, the greatest variability. The generic name Meridiana Schrank is reduced to Trianthema L.

N2  - The area of distribution of most Myriophyllum species is insufficiently known. In this paper, many new localities are recorded for 16 species from SE. Asia, Malesia, Madagascar, and Africa, and a key is added. One species from New Guinea, M. coronatum, is described as new (fig. I). Of the other species the synonymy is complete, but no descriptions are given; of each the distribution and ecology is cited, and if necessary critical remarks are added.Under the new species the second remark deals with the possible desirability of distinguishing subgenera or sections within the genus. It is concluded that, as the species show a reticulate affinity by parallelism, especially as regards reductions in both vegetative and sexual organs, the usefulness of distinguishing infrageneric taxa is debatable and not advisable.

N2  - This is a complete revision of this Central and S. American genus, well-known for its cultivated species. The main body consists of a taxonomic revision (text in German, descriptions in Latin); 39 species are keyed out, only one is new, there are I new combination and several new varieties, the latter mostly based on former species; a number of former species have been recognized as hybrids. Localities are very accurately given, often latitude and longitude are added. General chapters include ecology, pollination, palynology (by Dr. Punt), phytochemistry (by Dr. Hegnauer  Dr. Kubitzki), and chromosomes. At the end natural hybrids and those found in gardens are listed, concluded by a listed evaluation of taxa and cultivars found in cultivation. The author concludes that the genus is very homogeneous, also in pollen and chromosomes. This appears also from easy hybridization in which at least 10 species are involved, in culture sometimes even species which are in nature geographically isolated. And hybrids have at least in certain cases proved to be fertile. Even triple hybrids have been found. Because of the very large amount of material studied the species populations and their ranges have become rather clear and hybridization occurs where populations come into contact. From this the author deduces his opinion about the hybrid status of certain specimens. In one biotope only one species occurs and the species are hence replacing either geographically or ecologically. This is obviously comparable to the situation in the genus Geum.

N2  - This paper embraces a full taxonomic revision of the tribe Apostasieae. The introduction is followed by an ample discussion of the taxonomic position of the Apostasieae and the affinities within the tribe.The tribes Apostasieae and Cypripedieae are regarded as forming together the subfamily Cypripedioideae of the Orchidaceae.Notes are given on the morphology and an evaluation is given on systematic characters and their value for specific delimitation. Two characters were formerly underestimated in Neuwiedia, notably the indument (maximal length of the glandless hairs) and the structure (texture) of the pericarp. The systematic treatment provides descriptions of the tribe, the genera, and the species, keys for identification, full synonymy, typification, geographical distribution, and an index to specimens examined. The Apostasieae range from Ceylon to the Ryukyus through to the Louisiades and North Queensland. Ranges are drawn on maps. Two genera are distinguished, Apostasia and Neuwiedia; Adactylus is reduced to sectional status under Apostasia.In Neuwiedia 8 species are distinguished among which 4 are new, viz. 3 from Borneo and I from Siam. Under N. zollingeri, 2 varieties are recognized besides the type variety, both based on former species, viz. var. javanica (J.J.S.) de Vogel and var. singaporeana (Baker) de Vogel. One supposed new species is left unnamed because its flowers are yet unknown. In Apostasia 7 species are recognized; many earlier names had to be reduced; 4 belong to sect. Apostasia and 3 to sect. Adactylus Endl.

N2  - Of the genus Vavaea, occurring from Sumatra to Fiji, 356 collections were studied for taxonomical purpose, some collected in spirit by the author himself. Pollen (31 collections) and wood (12 collections) were also studied.Sex dimorphism occurs in V. amicorum, three sorts of plants being distinguished. The systematic position within Meliaceae comes in the Melioideae, between tribes Turraeeae and Trichilieae, more closely related to the latter. Within Vavaea two sections are distinguished, one of which is new. Four species are distinguished, among which is one new species, V. tubiflora, from New Guinea. A detailed study revealed that one of them, the type species V. amicorum, is an extremely polymorphic species with about 20 synonyms; a special chapter is dedicated to explain this variation pattern. A key to the species, descriptions of genus and species, and an enumeration of specimens is given.

N2  - This taxonomic revision includes all Ochnaceae from South and Southeast Asia, Malesia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. A much wider species concept is applied than in most previous works: 20 species in 10 genera are accepted for the area treated, whereas 199 specific synonyms are listed. A few taxa have been accepted at infra specific level among which Brackenridgea palustris ssp. kjellbergii Kanis is new. It is shown that some old specific names have been overlooked in the past and that the traditional concepts of some species have not been in accordance with the original concepts. All names, currently used for Asiatic species of Ochna L. and Gomphia Schreb. are no longer accepted here, O. jabotapita L. and G. serrata (Gaertn.) Kanis being the correct names for the respective type species. O. fascicularis Blanco is made the type of a distinct section Notochnella (v. Tiegh.) Kanis in the genus Brackenridgea A. Gray. A short history of the taxonomy is given and a partly new suprageneric subdivision of the Ochnaceae is subsequently proposed. Two subfamilies are recognised: the Ochnoideae comprising the tribes Ochneae and Elvasieae Rchb., and the Sauvagesoideae Lindl. including the tribes Sauvagesieae, Euthemideae Planch., and Lophireae Rchb. The Ochneae are newly subdivided in the subtribes Ochninae and Ouratinae (v. Tiegh.) Kanis, and the Sauvagesieae in the subtribes Sauvagesinae and Luxemburginae (Planch.) Kanis.* Some general remarks are made about morphological characters in the family, including some new characters of the pollen. An attempt is made towards a better understanding of the inflorescence types. It is assumed that the genera Ochna and Gomphia migrated from Africa into Asia. Other genera in Southeast Asia, Malesia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands are regarded as long established, because of the more or less relict-like nature of their areas.

N2  - In table I on page 6 of this volume the names of some taxa have been misspelled. Subfamily Sauvagesoideae Lindl. should read Sauvagesioideae Lindl. The subtribal names Sauvagesinae and Luxemburginae (Planch.) Kanis should be changed to Sauvagesiinae and Luxemburgiinae (Planch.) Kanis respectively. The orthographic errors mentioned have been made consistently throughout the text.In the same table the new subtribe Ouratinae (v. Tiegh.) Kanis was proposed with an incorrect reference to tribus Ourateae (non Engl.) v. Tiegh. (1902). The name Ourateae was introduced by Engler (Nova Acta Leop.-Carol. Akad. 37, 1874, 20) to indicate the tribe that should be called Ochneae, as Ochna L. should be considered the type genus of the family and lower taxa to which it belongs (cf. Art. 19: 3 of the present Code). Engler’s name was invalid, although he gave a Latin description (cf. Art. 32: 2 of the present Code). Van Tieghem correctly used the name Ourateae for a smaller tribe, segregated from his Ochneae. This should be considered as a new name, as he made a new description without reference to Engler’s. The new subtribe is based on the tribe Ourateae v. Tiegh. in Morot, J. Bot. 16 (1902) 33.

This species comprises a complex of forms, but the forms differ by such slight and subtle characters that they are not easily distinguished from dried specimens, and I have not attempted to distinguish them. The common character of all forms of the species is the presence of a longitudinal band of sporangia midway between the midrib and margin of each pinna, and the genus has hitherto been confined to species which have this character, the only variability in soral form being that the band of sporangia is sometimes not quite continuous.

N2  - During a collecting trip to Thailand, as a member of the Thai-Dutch botanical expedition 1965/1966, I was struck by the excessive amount of mucilage sometimes present on the circinnate fronds of several leptosporangiate ferns. This was especially evident in representatives of the monotypic fern family Plagiogyriaceae and the Thelypteroid ferns.The mucilage is secreted by a multitude of minute glandular hairs. In mature leaves the hairs are shrivelled and easily overlooked, or even have disappeared. Moreover, usually only herbarium specimens are available for investigation.

N2  - The identification of some thousands of ferns from New Guinea by the late Dr A. H. G. Alston (1940) resulted in the description of but comparatively few new species. His conclusion, that the fern flora of New Guinea ‘is now fairly well known’ may be right in a general way, but continuous collecting performed after his paper was published proved the existence of many more novelties. One of these is a new species of Todea, a representative of the Osmundaceae, a primitive family of ferns, which dates back to the Palaeozoicum (Hirmer, 1938).A recent study by Hewitson (1962) about the comparative morphology of the living Osmundaceae inspired me to make some remarks on the delimitation of the other recent genera.

N2  - Up to the present time Xenophya has been a monotypic genus known only from its type collection. It is closely related to the genus Alocasia from which it may be distinguished by its entirely persistent spathe and anatropous ovules. In Alocasia the upper part of the spathe quickly withers and is lost and the ovules are suborthotropous.Schott (Bonplandia 10, 1862, 148) described a Philippine plant as ‘Alocasia? (Schizocasta) portei’. Schizocasia cannot be considered as validly published here because the author did not accept the name (Art. 34, ICBN). Xenophya Schott (1863) was published by Schott and placed in the tribe Zomicarpeae of the subfamily Aroideae. Engler (in DC., Monogr. Phan. 2, 1879, 495) included Schizocasia portei as representing a monotypic genus but changed his mind in the Additamenta on page 645 and transterred the species back to Alocasia. Again, ‘Schizocasia’ was not validly published because the author did not accept the name. In the same publication Engler (p. 526—7) accepted Xenophya in the Zomicarpeae but expressed his great uncertainty about the placement of the genus. The genus Schizocasia was finally established by Engler (Bot. Jahrb. I, 1880, 185—6) based on a Papuan species, S. acuta. In this publication Engler comments how similar his plant is to Xenophya but it differs by the micropyles of the ovules of Schizocasia facing out and facing in in Xenophya. Finally, Engler (Pflanzenr. Heft 73 1920, 60) continued the placement of Xenophya in the Zomicarpeae but said in a note that it would be better placed in the Colocasioideae (where Schizocasia is placed). In the same publication Engler (Pflanzenr. Heft 71, 1920, 115) in his discussion of Schizocasia said that Schizocasia appears to be very similar to Xenophya but differs in the facing of its ovules and above all in its staminate flowers.

IV.23B Heft 37, 1908, p. 118) concluded that the closest relative of Spathiphyllum was the small Papuan genus Holochlamys Engl. and placed it in the Spathiphylleae, the second of two tribes of the subfamily Monsteroideae. The discovery of large numbers of distinctive trichosclereids (Nicolson, Amer. Journ. Bot. 47, 1960, p. 601) only in the species of these two genera supports Engler’s uniting of the genera as a tribe.The two genera can be distinguished by the following key: I. Peduncle as long as or longer than the petioles. Spathe persistent ........ Spathiphyllum I. Peduncle much shorter than petioles. Spathe marcescent ............. Holochlamys

N2  - This genus, like Anadendrum and Heteropsis, is intermediate between the subfamilies Pothoideae and Monsteroideae as constituted by Engler (1920, p.63). When Schott originally described the genus he placed it next to Anadendrum (Pothoideae). Engler (1879, p. 100) left it in the Pothoideae next to Heteropsis which followed Anadendrum. Later, Engler (1908, p. 118) transferred Amydrium to the Monsteroideae as a monotypic genus. In the same publication (p. 1) Engler established a new genus, Epipremnopsis, which he placed next to Anadendrum in the Pothoideae. In this treatment I propose to unite Epipremnopsis and its three species with the hitherto monotypic genus Amydrium.The species concerned are rather different from each other. Study of them in the wild and the herbarium suggested that they were congeneric. In a recent survey of aroid floral anatomy (Eyde et al., p. 481, 486, fig. 9—15, 27) it was found that Amydrium humile and Epipremnopsis media have virtually identical unilocular ovaries with a single, deeply intrusive placenta (since found in E. magnifica and zippeliana). This striking condition has arisen from a bilocular ovary by abortion of the opposing placenta. Among the other aroids this character in known only in the genus Epipremnum and is the fundamental difference separating it from its near relatives, Rhaphidophora and Scindapsus Amydrium is distinguished from Epipremnum by its lack of needlelike trichosclereids which are abundant in the flowers and fruits of Epipremnum.

N2  - This bulky volume treats not less than c. 100 families, among which large families as the Araliaceae, Saxifragaceae (split in several families), Flacourtiaceae, Urticaceae, Moraceae, Proteaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and the Malvales families. This is a very large achievement, as it covers c. 2000 genera. Naturally, Hutchinson keeps to his narrow family concept and has here even extended this. Also several genera have been split, and a small revolution has occurred with Schefflera sunk in others have been reinstated, e.g. and Capparis; ; also sometimes old generic names long Osmoxylum against Boerlagiodendron.In the introduction the author states that the Cleomoideae will be segregated from the Capparaceae and be inserted next to the Cruciferae as a separate family, as they belong to the ‘Herbacae’; most of us regard the Cruciferae as a derived, specialized, largely temperate offshoot of the Capparaceae.

N2  - Miconia michelangeliana belongs to Miconia sect. Tamonea. This new species can be distinguished from other species in this section by the strongly winged branches and the glabrous leaves. The flowers are larger than usual in the genus, and are 6-merous, pleiostemonous (with 18–24 stamens each), with a persistent calyx and a glabrous ovary apex. This species occurs only in montane forests in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil.

N2  - Through the efforts of Dr T. C. Whitmore and Mr G. F. C. Dennis large collections of trees from the Solomons have been accumulated in the past six years. Among them are some interesting collections of the genus Crossostylis, a truly oceanic-Pacific genus, ranging from the Tuamotos westwards as far as and including the Solomon Is. and New Caledonia. A map of its distribution has been given in ‘Pacific Plant Areas’ vol. I, map 23. Whitmore in his ‘Guide to the Forests of the British Solomon Islands’ 1966, p. 174, listed only C. cominsii Hemsl. from the Santa Cruz group.There appears, however, to be a second, undescribed species from the Solomons proper.

N2  - In 1759 Linnaeus described an American species under Gentiana, as G. verticillata. In 1781 his son recorded (Suppl. 174) a specimen from India leg. D. D. Fabricius under the same name, without reference to the earlier G. verticillata, and gave a full description. Whether this was just a new record or whether he really intended to describe a new species, which then involves that he was not aware of the name his father had preoccupied, is difficult to prove. No references were mentioned though he gave these elsewhere under other species described before. Though Index Kewensis did not enter this homonym I am rather convinced that it was intended as a new species, also in connection with the fact that he based the description on an Indian specimen. Nomenclaturally this is anyway not very important, but taxonomically it is, because his name and description were made after an Old World species which already Vahl in 1794 (Symb. 3, 46—47) pointed out was different from the American species, without adjusting the necessary nomenclatural consequence. Before Vahl, Retzius had already hinted at this difference (Symb. 2, 1781, 15) in making two varieties under G. verticillatum L. (‘verticillaris’). Even Burman f. (Fl. Ind. 1768, 73) had already remarked that the Coromandel plant differed from the American one figured by Plunder.The distinction of two species was achieved by Willdenow in 1798, who, agreeing with Vahl, at the same time accommodated the two species in the genus Exacum, keeping the epithet verticillatum correctly for the American species and adopting a new epithet hyssopifolium for the Old World ’Gentiana verticillatum L. f.’.

DC. It differed, however, considerably from the Asian representatives of that species.Being curious to know whether B. sensitivum (L.) DC. occurs in Africa, which appeared to be important for its geographical distribution in conjunction with my revision of the Oxalidaceae for the Flora Malesiana, I could borrow, thanks to the kind cooperation of the directors of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Brussels, a large amount of African material of ‘B. sensitivum’, in all approximately 40 and 150 sheets respectively.

N2  - From culture studies it appears that the species of Erythrocladia and Erythrotrichia have a great morphological variability. The delimitation of the species has been studied. In the genus Erythrocladia two species are recognized, in Erythrotrichia three, and in Porphyropsis two. In cultures of Erythrotrichia carnea a conchocelis stage was found; its morphological structure is similar to that of the conchocelis thalli as described for Bangia and Porphyra. The mode of spore formation in the conchocelis thalli is, however, different; in Erythrotrichia monospores were formed whereas in Bangia and Porphyra only neutral spores are known.Cell-fusions were observed in filaments of Erythrotrichia carnea; this could indicate the occurrence of sexual reproduction. There is a striking agreement with the observations made bij Flint and Magne on Kyliniella and Rhodochaete respectively.Besides a preliminary scheme of the life-cycle of Erythrotrichia carnea, information on distribution, cytology, development, and asexual reproduction of all species is given.

Details of the aim and scope of these investigations have been set forth by Brongersma and Pannekoek (1966).The present paper deals with the macroscopic algae of this region. Firstly, it was attempted to obtain a complete survey of the floristic composition. These data were utilized in a study of algal phytogeography (van den Hoek and Donze, 1967). Secondly, a rough description of the intertidal vegetation types and zonation patterns is given. Thirdly, the local distribution of species and vegetation types is outlined with respect to the main environmental factors. Fourthly, a rather detailed picture of the depthdistribution of many species is given.

N2  - Cultural and caryological investigations on Sphacelaria furcigera from Hoek van Holland give evidence of a slightly heteromorphic diplohaplontic life-history in this species. A relatively slender (13.5—31 μ) haploid gametophytic phase alternates with a more robust (19—41 μ) diploid sporophytic phase. Female gametophytes form plurilocular macrogametangia at 12˚ C and 4˚ C, male gametophytes form plurilocular microgametangia at 12˚ C and 4˚ C. Zygotes of female macrogametes and male microgametes grow into diploid sporophytes which form unilocular meiotosporangia at 4˚ C. Meiosis takes place in the initials of these sporangia. About 50 % of the spores produced by them grow into male gametophytes, about 50 % into female gametophytes. Propagules are formed at higher temperatures, i.e. at 12˚ C and 20° C. In nature gametangia are formed during the winter half of the year, and propagules during the summer half of the year. Female gametes can develop parthenogenetically into new female gametophytes, but also into haploid plants forming unilocular zoidangia instead of plurilocular macrozoidangia. Such plants are repeatedly formed and represent dead ends in the life-history of S. furcigera. The result of our investigations are summarized in fig. 4. Sphacelaria britannica Sauv. and S. saxatilis (Kuck.) Kuck. ex Sauv. are synonyms of S. furcigera Kütz.

N2  - After the treatment of Jumelle in the Flore de Madagascar fam. 23 (1936) substantial additions were made and much material has accumulated. Instead of 7 species of Aponogeton distinguished by Jumelle, 11 are recognized in the present revision, among which 3 are new to science. Moreover it was found that the epithet of the laceplant — up till now fenestralis — has to be changed in madagascariensis. All names have been properly typified; all types could be examined by the author. Quite a few species were observed in cultivation, thanks to generous support from overseas. Special attention has been paid to a detailed examination of the seed structure and that of the embryo and also to flower dimorphism. Descriptions are given of all species and two keys are provided for their identification, one by several gross morphological characters and one based on the characters of the seed and embryo. No attempt has been made to provide a full bibliography of each species; this would have become very complicated by the fact that in former treatments not rarely sheets were assigned to species to which they do not belong. It appeared not useful to cite all these ‘sensus’ and ‘pro partes’. Of each species a distribution map was prepared. All examined sheets are enumerated in an identification list.

N2  - In both editions of the author’s ‘Families of Flowering Plants’ was a key for identification of families of the world. This was constantly improved by the author and has now been edited separately as a companion to his new work ‘The Genera of Flowering Plants’.Essentially the structure of the key is not changed. It is made more handable by having instead of 15 groups in former editions, 32 groups in this work. The number of families, already risen to 411 in the 2nd edition of the 'Families', is still increased by some new ones in this key, and new families appear steadily in the 'Genera', so that we will soon end up with half a thousand families of which more than 60 % will be monotypic or almost so.

N2  - The elevation effect is defined as the phenomenon that mountain plants occur only on mountains which attain a certain minimum altitude peculiar to the species, but that they generally descend below this critical altitude on the higher mountains.It can also be expressed in figures as the difference between the minimum altitude of the peaks and that of the lowest known locality. If for example a species occurs from 1500 m upwards, but only on mountains whose highest peak exceeds 2200 m altitude, the effect amounts to 2200—1500 = 700 m. First observed for one plant on the volcanoes of Java by Backer  van Slooten (1924), it was assumed applicable to all Malesian mountain plants by van Steenis (1934). It was further elucidated by him (1961) by a number of computed examples; he abandoned the earlier idea that it had something to do with the ‘Massenerhebungseffekt’ (mountain mass-elevation effect) and gave an explanation for the elevation effect by assuming that each mountain plant occupies a zone of permanent establishment, on both sides bordered by a zone of temporary localities, the critical altitude being the lower contour of the permanent establishment (fig. 1). In other words, mountain plants can only descend to their lowest localities on peaks whose summits fall at least partly in the zone of permanent establishment, ensuring a constant upper source for descending diaspores. If the explanation is correct, the elevation effect must be universally valid for all mountain plants, and not only for those on volcanoes.Encouraged by an observation of a New Zealand Ranunculus by Fischer (1965), which was said to occur only on mountains with a minimum peak altitude, the author has tested the alpine flora of Switzerland on the occurrence of the elevation effect.For this purpose he has drawn a map of Switzerland at the 2000 m contour by which it became divided into 121 ‘mountain islands’ exceeding that altitude (list p. 278, Karte 1). Then 23 species of mountain plants were selected responding to the conditions that they occur largely above 2000 m, that they are fairly common, that they are not expressly bound to very narrow ecological conditions, and finally that they are homogeneous and do not show infraspecific differentiation (see list on p. 280).The proper scoring was done in II herbaria in Switzerland, public and private, from many thousands of sheets of which the label carried an altitudinal notation, in a few cases supplemented by data from local monographs.The complete survey of altitudinal data, with their frequencies for each species has been compiled in table 1; for four species these data have been figured in graphs illustrating more clearly the tailing off of frequencies at both higher and lower altitudes. For each species a detailed account is given of the number of specimens examined, their distribution over the various ‘mountain islands’, data found in literature, lowest ‘mountain island’ on which the species is found, a list of the lower localities, and finally a discussion of the results.It appears that each of the 23 species examined shows the elevation effect and that there is no reason to doubt its general validity, even for arimals. All occur only on mountains with a minimum altitude and all descend on the ‘mountain islands’ to a distinctly lower altitude. The elevation effect in metres for each species, as computed by the difference between the height of the lowest ‘mountain island’ on which it occurs and the lowest locality known, is reproduced in table 2 on p. 312. The explanation adhered to is that the scarce lowest localities are, for their maintenance, entirely dependent on the continuous supply of diaspores from the permanent, higher situated populations. On the higher mountains there is a continuous supply from this source, but this is absent on the mountains not reaching above the minimum altitude.The elevation effect is influenced in detail by various ecological factors among which the most important are: temperature, soil, physiognomy of the vegetation, autecology of the species, dispersal biology, and man. These factors have all been discussed separately. It appears that the lowest localities always occur on sites which deviate in some way or other very locally from the surrounding biotope, by lower temperature, more open vegetation, etc. Such ‘enclaves’ show characteristics of higher situated zones; they are for example streamborders, glaciers, deep ravines, waterfalls, etc.

N2  - When revising the Icacinaceae from SE. Asia and Malesia recently, my interest was drawn again to the genus Lophopyxis Hook. f. Designated by its author (1887) tentatively as a member of the Euphorbiaceae, it was rejected from this family by Pax as early as 1890. Engler (1893) transferred Lophopyxis to the Icacinaceae as the type of a new subfamily Lophopyxidoideae. Hallier f. (1910) disputed Engler’s view and retained it in the Euphorbiaceae, from which it was excluded again by Pax  Hoffmann in 1931. A possible place in the Rhamnaceae and Flacourtiaceae was considered and rejected by Gilg in 1918; Bakhuizen van den Brink Jr.  van Steenis (1966) likewise rejected the former, though its alliance with the Rhamnaceae was firmly expressed by Airy Shaw (1966). Other authors, as Pierre quoted by Boerlage (1890), inserted Lophopyxis in the Saxifragaceae, Schumann (1898) in the Olacaceae, and Ridley (1922) in Bentham’s Olacineae. In more recent times the genus was referred again to the Icacinaceae by Schellenberg (1923) and Kanehira (1931), but excluded from that family by Hallier f. (1921) and Sleumer (1942). Dahl (1955), discussing the pollen morphology of Lophopyxis, stated that the range of pollen forms known to exist within the Euphorbiaceae could include that of Lophopyxis. Erdtman in the newest edition of his ‘Pollen Morphology and Plant Taxonomy’ (1966) still placed it under Euphorbiaceae. Hutchinson (1959), and subsequently Scholz (1964), place it in the Celastraceae. Though Lophopyxis fits in the general circumscription of the Celastraceae, and shares the winged fruit with the subfamily Tripterygioideae, it cannot be placed in the latter, which all have basal ovules, whilst Lophopyxis has pendent (and certainly epitropous) ones. If placed in the Celastraceae, it would keep an isolated position, as, for instance, does Siphonodon.There is thus no certainty as to the right place of this genus, whose gross morphology, wood anatomy, embryology, and pollen morphology is so well known to-day, in one of the established plant families. It therefore seems justified to regard it as the type of a family of its own within the Geraniales-Sapindales-Celastrales. Suggested already by van Tieghem (1897) and Pierre (1897) casually as Lophopyxidacées’, the family was formally described by Pfeiffer (1951) who raised Engler’s Lophopyxidoideae to family rank, and recently conceived by Airy Shaw (1966).

N2  - Nine species of Potentilla are recognized for the Malesian area, two more are insufficiently known. Of the nine species, one is new (P. hooglandii), a new variety is also described ( P. foersteriana var. ima). Duchesnea is considered congeneric with Potentilla.Although for Fragaria the same case could be made, it is kept separated for practical reasons and for reasons of nomenclatural stability. In Malesia two species occur, both introduced. Some reductions and nomenclatural rectifications will also be found in the present revision which is a precursor towards a revision of the Rosaceae for Flora Malesiana.

N2  - In March 1962 Mr. A. Hoogerwerf collected swamp and savannah plants in the extreme South of New Guinea, about 25 km WNW. of Merauke, near a place Kurik, c. 10 km north of the mouth of the Kali Kumbe. There the Government was planning to start a mechanical rice plant with polders, as has been done in Suriname. As the experimental plot was menaced by too many birds, Mr. Hoogerwerf, an ornithologist, was making an investigation of the avifauna and collected plants in and around the marshes in order to verify later on which plants the birds fed.Among his collection there were many interesting plant species, especially sedges; Fimbristylis blepharolepis Kern was even a new species. Cyperus cf. angustatus R.Br., Rhynchospora heterochaeta Blake, and Fimbristylis dictyocolea Blake proved new for Malesia, Scleria laxa R.Br, new for the Papuan flora. Further there were much species belonging to the Australian element as Hardenbergia retusa Bth., Philydrum lanuginosum Gaertn., Calogyne pilosa R.Br., Phacellothrix cladochaeta F. v. M., Leptocarpus, Ceratanthus longicornis F. v. M., etc.

Freycinetia) has because of numerous additions to our knowledge of the genus become obsolete. Fifteen new sections are proposed, based on natural species-groups, and the original two sections are restricted and redefined. Species not yet adequately known may be termed Freycinetiae imperfectae, when only staminate specimens are known, or incertae sedis. A map showing the distribution of the genus is included.

N2  - Many ecologists have occupied themselves with the problem of the littoral zonation and they still disagree among themselves about the delimitation of the zones and the factors which cause the zonation. In this paper the problem has been approached in two different ways. In the first place the littoral zone sensu lato has been regarded as the border area between the sea and the land. This approach does not result in an explanation of the ‘submergence’ of many eulittoral organisms in the Arctic waters and the Baltic. Secondly the littoral zone sensu lato has been considered as the border zone between the sea and the fresh water, in other words as a brackish environment. This approach gives a reasonable explanation for the ‘submergence’ of littoral organisms in low-salinity waters. It appears that both tidal movements and wave action (wash, splash, and spray) cause salinity fluctuations and that salinity is one of the major factors acting in the littoral zonation. Most of the organisms which do not show ‘submergence’ in low-salinity waters are restricted to the supralittoral and the upper part of the intertidal zone, where they are beyond the influence of the daily tidal rhythm. The vital factor for these organisms is contact with the air. The third active factor, light, is of some importance in the lower part of the eulittoral. These three abiotic factors, together with biological stress (competition), effectuate the littoral zonation pattern. Both the supralittoral and the eulittoral are well-defined ecological units, characterized by their own physical features and their own species composition. In fact they have almost no common species. Strong wave action allows some eulittoral species to survive in the supralittoral; this has to be regarded merely as an interference phenomenon.The littoral border environment is in comparison with other brackish habitats extremely rich in species peculiar to it. In this environment the influence of the salt extends far above the tidal influence. In the estuarine environment, which has very few species exclusively bound to it, the reverse is the case. This could indicate that marine salt beyond the reach of the regular tidal rhythm creates conditions favourable for speciation.

N2  - Joséphine Th. Koster entered her service at the Rijksherbarium as an assistant, April 1930, in the midst of the economic crisis. She was engaged as an, unsalaried collaborator, the then current type of position the Netherlands’ State could offer its scientific offspring. When Prof. Dr. H. J. Lam, freshly appointed Director in August 1933, ordered her to start work each morning as early as the salaried staff-members, she resigned from her unremunerative post by 31 Dec. 1933. She then continued, as a guest of the Rijksherbarium, her investigations on the Compositae of the Dutch East Indies, and in 1935 she took her doctor’s degree on the thesis ‘The Compositae of the Malay Archipelago’ at Leyden University. Her promotor was Prof. Lam.In the end the unfavourable labour-market of that time appeared to have favourable consequences for algology; for Miss Koster, she once confessed to me, had a great ambition to teach biology in secondary schools!

N2  - Until the beginning of this century Colpomenia sinuosa (Mert.) Roth was the only species of the genus known in European waters; it was first found by Mertens in 1806 off Cadiz. Mertens made drawings of it and sent them with his specimens to Roth who described it as Ulva sinuosa and published the description of this alga and Mertens’ drawings in his Catalecta Botanica vol. III in that year.At the beginning of this century a Colpomenia caused considerable damage to the oyster industry in France. Plants of Colpomenia attached themselves to the oysters in the oyster beds at Vannes and other places on the west coast of France. When the Colpomenia bladders became old they were filled with a mixture of air and water and caused the oysters to be buoyed up to the surface of the water and float away and be lost. This Colpomenia spread to the Channel coast of Brittany and Normandy and across to the Scilly Isles and along the south coast of England and became well established there early in the century.

Dagegen ist — von Chara abgesehen — über das normale Wachstum, den zeitlichen Ablauf von Teilung und Streckung der Zellen und die Entstehungsgeschichte des typischen Thallus nur wenig bekannt. Für solche Untersuchungen bietet sich die Kultur von Algen im Laboratorium an. Formen von einfachem Aufbau sind hervorragend geeignet, um Wachstumsvorgänge in ihrer Abhängigkeit von den sie beeinflussenden Faktoren zu erforschen. Das interkalare Wachstum wurde an der monosiphonen, mehrkernigen Urospora wormskioldii studiert (Kornmann 1966). Die Entstehung eines verzweigten monosiphonen Thallus aus einer vielkernigen Apikalzelle konnte an dem Beispiel von Acrosiphonia verfolgt werden (1965). Spongomorpha aeruginosa ist äusserlich gleichartig aufgebaut, hat aber einkernige Zellen und stellt damit das einfachste Muster eines solchen Thallus dar.

N2  - In the early part of 1962 Dr. R. F. Scagel and the senior author collected at several localities in East Africa (from Malindi, Kenya, southward as far as Mozambique Island, Mozambique) a member of the Fucales which the present authors determined as a species of Cystophyllum (fig. 1). On the basis of material in the herbarium of the University of California and from previous descriptions it seemed that the East African plants could be referred either to C. trinode (Forsskål) J. Agardh, the lectotype of the genus (vide DeToni, 1891, p. 175), or to C. muricatum (C. Agardh) J. Agardh. This uncertainty caused us to make a careful examination of the fairly ample material of these two taxa available to us.² We could find no character whereby an eastern species, Cystophyllum muricatum, which extends westward to the Persian Gulf and Mauritius (Brøgesen, 1939, 1948), can be separated from a Red Sea and East African species, C. trinode.

N2  - We describe the vegetation of Kwerba, in the foothills of the Foja Mountains in the Mamberamo Basin of West Papua, Indonesia. Few surveys have been carried out in this remote area of Western New Guinea. Working in collaboration with local people we made 15 plots, 10 in primary forest, 3 in secondary forest and 2 in gardens. A total of 487 morpho-species were distinguished, of which 32 % (156) did not match any herbarium specimens or published reference.Tree densities (598 ± 136/ha) are similar to lowland forests elsewhere, but mean stem sizes (22 ± 1 cm dbh and 21 ± 2 m height for trees over 10 cm dbh) appear small. Numbers of tree species per plot (22 ± 4, of 40 stems recorded) are unremarkable, but levels of endemism are potentially high with many of the unidentified species being rare (seldom collected) or undescribed. This is the first quantitative description of vegetation in Kwerba, Foja and Mamberamo, and joins only a handful of such studies in Papua. Additional botanical and ecological survey effort is greatly needed in Mamberamo, and in New Guinea generally.

N2  - The term ‘brackish water’ is used in several senses and, therefore, I want at first to explain what I consider to be brackish water and what not. Redeke (1933) defined brackish water as a mixture of fresh water and sea water sensu stricto. This definition excludes the continental salt waters which have a different origin. There exist, however, salt waters which have lost long ago their contact with the sea and have now a chemical composition completely aberrant from sea water, due to the joint effect of continual inflow of new electrolytes with river water, evaporation, and precipitation. As examples the Caspian and the Aral Sea may be mentioned.Other investigators prefer to include on grounds of hydrological and hydrochemical similarities also the continental salt waters which at no time in their history have been in contact with the sea, e.g. the Great Salt Lake in Utah, U.S.A. They regard as brackish all salt waters which have a lower salinity than the sea. According to Schmitz (1959) the differences between the continental and marine salt waters are only of a relative value as both categories have the following four hydrological characters in common: 1. The total salinity is generally between that of fresh and sea water. 2. The waters show often salinity stratification. 3. Horizontal differences in salinity occur e.g. where a river discharges in a salt lake. 4. Large seasonal fluctuations in salinity occur.

N2  - One of the major scientific efforts of the decade has been the International Indian Ocean Expedition of 1960—64, involving several institutions and ships and numerous scientists. With an oceanographic focus, not only physical and biological open sea oceanographic studies were carried on, but littoral and sublittoral work as well, on shores and reefs. Geographically, too, the range was wide, and respecting algae particularly so, though predominately western.The chief algal collectors were Professors G. F. Papenfuss (University of California, Berkeley) and R. F. Scagel (University of British Columbia). Papenfuss joined the Israel South Red Sea Expedition prior to sharing in the Indian Ocean Expedition, and Scagel joined him to work on the African east coast and off-lying islands, continuing south to Cape Town. The Red Sea Caulerpas will be reported elsewhere by myself, and those from South Africa by Papenfuss. To a few Australian collections from Scagel are added a few more from Singapore and elsewhere by Dr. L. H. Colinvaux (Ohio State University) and Professor R. E. Norris (University of Washington). Materials from Papenfuss and Scagel reached me in generous measure directly from the collectors; material from the others came by courtesy of the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center, and to all these sources I am much indebted for the materials and for information of various kinds.

N2  - The following notes refer to the typification of the two oldest species names applied in the genus Gelidium, including also comments on other related topics. Gelidium is probably the most confused genus, both nomenclaturally and taxonomically, of the Rhodophyta. This investigation began in an attempt to determine the correct names to be applied to the British species of the genus, but it was soon discovered that a much wider geographical consideration was necessary. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the help and assistance which has been afforded by Dr. J. Th. Koster in this and other investigations, over a period of many years.Extreme ecological and seasonal polymorphism are the principal causes of the present situation in the genus Gelidium. Extensive fieldwork over the past seventeen years has given some indication of the limits of taxa (Dixon, 1958, 1966), in so far as the European representatives are concerned. The nomenclatural problems are, however, still largely untouched. The purpose of the present paper is to examine critically the typification of the two oldest epithets referred to the genus Gelidium. These are: 1. cartilagineum, based on Fucus cartilagineus Linnaeus (1753), 2. corneum, based on Fucus corneus Hudson (1762).

N2  - It is concluded on the basis of data gathered from the literature and of our personal observations, that the algal phytogeographic provinces as assumed by several authors do not exist. The algal floras of NW. Spain and Brittany are richest in species. From these two regions down to the south but far more so up to the north the algal flora gradually changes mainly by species dropping out and being only partially replaced by others.One very obvious floristic discontinuity is not correlated with a discontinuity in the temperaturerange of the surface-water, namely the one along the west coasts of the British Isles. The floristic discontinuity Arctic Europe-Spitsbergen is correlated with a temperature discontinuity. Floristically and as regards temperature-range of the surface-water, the Côte Basque finds its logical place in between NW. Spain and Morocco.

N2  - The populations of the seaward intertidal ends of the 1955 lava flows in Hawaii were studied during the first few years of their development. Different seral phenomena were recognized such as pioneer colonization, succession, disclimax, and subclimax. The term climax is used as a practical term to denote existence of an equilibrium between the populations and the environment. Appearance of the climax situation seems to be related to stability of the substratum for a period at least as long as six to ten years, but even populations on surfaces as old as 100 years are different from some that are on adjacent prehistoric surfaces.

N2  - New details could be derived from the study of fixed male and female flowers of Scyphostegia borneensis Stapf. Of prime importance among these is the exact structure of the female reproductive units. They correspond to what are generally recognized as ovules. These anatropous ovules have a constriction separating funicle and raphe, an aril (loid) of mixed character, a distal integumental extension, and a fivelobed exostome. Their placentation is basal. Together, they are enclosed by an urceolate wall consisting of three-trace units which are apically stigmatic. These sterile units form septs growing downwards between the tips of the ovules, giving rise to locules which are open below. The morphological interest of some of these details was discussed. The embryosack development could be followed. The fruit appeared to be a fleshy capsule.The striking similarity with certain formations in the Monimiaceae is not based on affinity. As to the above characters the alleged affinity with the Flacourtiaceae could not be checked because comparable characters in that family have never been studied. However, there is a correspondence with such details known in the Tamaricaceae. Moreover, in the Tamaricaceae the placentation is intermediate between basal and parietal. This was considered to favour the inclusion of the Scyphostegiaceae in the Parietales. Of all the Parietales families they must be nearest to the Flacourtiaceae, as judged from external characters.

Bot. Montréal no 23 (1959) 78, suggested that the neglected name might be the correct one for Carex tricephala Boeck. (1875), the only Carex species of the area that would fit Burman’s description. To me this supposition seemed unlikely, as Carex tricephala is a very rare species not known to occur in Java. Merrill, Philip. J. Sc. 19 (1921) 341, already suspected that Burman’s plant does not belong in Carex, but perhaps in Eleocharis or possibly in Fimbristylis.

N2  - This paper complements the revision which before long will appear in the Flora Malesiana, where a key to all species will be given, and descriptions of the Malesian taxa over their whole area; the few non-Malesian taxa are here described. It accounts for the complete synonymy (147 binomials) and typification, with the literature relating to the regions adjacent to Malesia.An Identification List of all examined specimens was separately issued in the Flora Malesiana Lists, number 27 (1966) 430—442; the Herbaria which supplied the materials are: Arnold Arboretum (A), British Museum, Natural History (BM), Bogor (BO), Brisbane (BRI), Cambridge (CGE), Dehra Dun (DD), Gray Herbarium (GH), Kew (K), Leiden (L), Leningrad (LE), Michigan (MICH), Sydney (NSW), Paris (P), Manila (PNH), Singapore (SING), Utrecht (U), Berkeley (UC), and Washington (US).

N2  - During my trip to Malaysia in 1966, sponsored by the Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO), for doing field work on Anacardiaceae, a new tree genus was found in Sarawak belonging to the family Celastraceae which I have revised for the Flora Malesiana series I, volume 6.While camping at the Nyabau Forest Reserve, Bintulu, Sarawak, with the field team of the Forest Department, I examined and collected a number of interesting plants. The area is quite near the sea coast and the type of forest is intermediate between kĕrangas (heath forest) and dipterocarpaceous forests. One day, the plant collector Mr Sibat ak Luang guided me to see a flowering tree of Anisophyllea ferruginea Ding Hou ( Rhizophorac.). On the way I picked up one fallen flower from the forest floor just a few metres from the camp. With its characteristic fleshy disk and three stamens, I thought it might belong to Salacia (Celastrac.). I showed the flower to Sibat and asked him to look for the plant. He pointed to a tree, c. 12 m tall, beside me. I could hardly believe it, because the Malesian Salacia species are mostly lianas. He climbed the tree and obtained a fertile branch for me. I examined the material and the flower in my hand was evidently from that tree. To my surprise, the leaves were distinctly alternate, while those of the Salacia species are mostly decussate.

N2  - A brief history is given on the circumscription and subdivision of Lecythidaceae and the position of Barringtonia. All aspects, also of auxiliary disciplines point to affinity with Myrtaceae but warrant separate family status. The conviction is that only one family is concerned, not two, or even three, as Knuth proposed.The subdivision of Lecythidaceae appears to meet with great difficulty. It does not seem to be possible to divide the family in tribes which would be restricted to the New and Old Worlds respectively, affinities running transoceanic.In the present revision of the genus Barringtonia 39 species are distinguished, 3 of which have one or a few new subspecies, varieties, or forms; three species are newly described. A survey is given of the morphological characters, their variation, and systematical value.Great attention is given to the seed structure and blastogeny which could be studied in two species. Various dubious or erroneous former statements on the peculiar embryo could be straightened out. The mature embryo is almost unique among Angiosperms because it is a solid body, provided with a spiral of small scales, but without cotyledons as usually understood. After germination this spiral is continued, first with cataphylls and finally with normal leaves.A similar structure is possibly found in other genera of Lecythidaceae; it appears highly desirable that embryogeny of all genera be studied, to ascertain its systematical importance.Two sections based on the calyx structure can be distinguished. This coincides with former generic distinction. Barringtonia sens. str. has initially a closed calyx which later disrupts into pseudolobes or opens circumscissile and Stravadium has a calyx which is open from the beginning. Within these sections eleven smaller groups of mutually allied species are present but they can only vaguely be defined and do not represent taxa.All species were examined palynologically and appeared to belong to eight pollen types, each comprising one or more species. These types can be arranged into two main types which do not coincide with the two taxonomical sections. On the whole it appeared that at the species level the groups are satisfactorily in accord with the pollen types.

N2  - In the course of the revision of the Asian species of the genus Adenia Forsk. (tropical and subtropical Africa, tropical S.E. Asia, Malay Archipelago, N. Australia) it appeared that two valid old epithets have been overlooked which should have priority. Consequently the fairly well established names of two Adenias, Adenia palmata (Lamk.) Engler and Adenia nicobarica (Kurz) King have to be changed into the following names, with which the synonomy and short annotations are given: Adenia hondala (Gaertner) de Wilde, comb. nov. — Granadilla hondala Gaertner, De Fruct. II (1791) 480, t. 180 f. 10. — Passiflora itondala Steudel, Nom. ed. I (1821) 595, nom. illeg., errore. — Passiflora hondala Steudel, Nom. ed. 2, 2 (1841) 275. — Lectotype: Herman s.n.

(1717) 25, 41, 62. — ‘Bryonia Zeylanica folio quinquepartito ....’ etc., Burman, Thes. Zeyl. (1737) 49. —‘ Bryonia foliis palmatis ....’ etc., Linné, Fl. Zeyl. (1748) 167.] — Lectotype : Herman s.n.

Veg. ed. 15 (1797) 209. — Modecca tuberosa Roxb., Hort. Beng. (1814) 49; Fl. Ind. (1832) 134. — [‘Modecca’ Rheede, Hort. Mai. 8 (1688) 39, t. 20. — ‘Passiflora spuria bryonoides quinquefido folio Malabarensi’ Plukenet, Almag. (1720) 283. — ‘Modecca fructu majore .... etc. Linné, Fl. Zeyl. (1748) 230 p.p.]. — Type: Rheede’s description and figure. [‘Palmodecca’ Rheede, Hort. Mal. 8 (1688) 41, t. 21. — ‘Passiflora spuria bryonoides Malabarensis folio trifido et quinquefido’ Plukenet, Almag. (1720) 283. — Type: Rheede’s description and figure.]. [‘Motta-Modecca’ Rheede, Hort. Mal. 8 (1688) 43, t. 22. — ‘ ‘Passiflora spuria bryonoides Malabarensis, foliis variis scissis, fructo diverso’ Plukenet, Almag. (1720) 283. — Type: Rheede’s description and figure.]. Modecca palmata Lamk., Encycl. Meth. IV (1797) 209. — Adenia palmata (Lamk.) Engler, Bot.

Ind. Bat. II, 1 (1855) 703. — [‘Orela-Modecca’ Rheede, Hort. Mai. 8 (1688) 45, t. 23.]. — Type: Rheede’s description and figure. From the above it is obvious that the oldest epithet, namely that of Bryonia palmata L. (1753) cannot be conveyed to Adenia on account of the heterotypic synonym Adenia palmata (Lamk.) Engler. Bryonia palmata L. is ultimately based on the descriptions of Herman (1717) and Burman (1737). Herman’s plant is to be expected in the Herman Herbarium in the British Museum, but according to Trimen (1888, 1894¹)) the specimen in Herman’s herbarium representing Bryonia palmata L. is no Adenia. As far as could be traced through the care of Prof. Miège, the only specimen in the Geneva herbarium existent of the present species in the Burman Herbarium is annotated: ‘J. Burmann, no 179, Ceylam 1773’ and therefore cannot have served as type. There is certainly no Adenia among the photographs of Bryonia in the Linnean Herbarium. Gaertner’s protologue comprises besides the description, a figure, and the citation of the seeds in the Ley den herbarium (not seen by me), the reference to Herman’s Musaeum Zeylanicum (1717) p. 41. As long as cannot be proved that the seeds which served for Gaertner’s description of Granadilla hondala are taken from the same specimen that was used by Linnaeus for the description of Bryonia palmata, Gaertner’s name is legitimate (compare art. 63 of the Code) and should be used. Adenia penangiana (Wall, ex G. Don) de Wilde, comb. nov. — Passiflora penangiana Wall. Cat. 1233, nom. nud.; G. Don, Gen. Syst. Gard. Bot. III (1834) 55. — Anthactinia penangiana (Wall.) Roemer, Syn.

Passiflora penangiana Wall., was validated by G. Don in 1834. Don’s description is fairly brief, but there is no doubt that the type-specimen ( Wallich no 1233, from Penang, in K), belongs to the present species which is generally known as Adenia nicobarica. Recently Dr. M. Jacobs examined on my request the type, containing several leaves with the typical peltate blade-base bearing a single gland. Passiflora penangiana Wall, was already placed in the synonomy of Modecca nicobarica Kurz by M. T. Masters in Hook ƒ., Fl. Br. Ind. 2 (1879) 603, who stated that Wallich’s specimen evidently belongs to that species.

N2  - The genus Epilobium (Onagraceae) comprises about 200 species, but is best represented at relatively high latitudes. Only eight species of the genus occur in Malesia, but they are interesting phytogeographically and shed considerable light on the overall patterns of differentiation in the genus. Further, it is of particular interest to review this assemblage of species for the following reasons. The only comprehensive treatment of the genus Epilobium is that of Carl Haussknecht, who in 1884 published his Monographie der Gattung Epilobium. At the time Haussknecht wrote, not a single collection of the genus had been made in Malesia, although three of the eight species in the area had been described from material obtained elsewhere. There has been no attempt to review the species of Epilobium found in Malesia as a whole or in any of its subdivisions, although of course new species have been described from the area from time to time.Of the eight species of Epilobium found in Malesia, four are endemic to the area. All of these endemic species are found in New Guinea, but one (E. prostratum) also occurs in Celebes and Central Ceram. As might be expected, this is the species which occurs at the lowest elevations in New Guinea, and is the least restricted to alpine grasslands, occurring also in moist, disturbed areas that are moderately shaded, as on roadbanks and along streams. This group of four New Guinea species shows evident affinities with some of those found in the Australasian region. Thus there are four groups of the genus currently recognized as occurring in New Zealand and Australia, all essentially endemic to the Australasian area [Allan, Fl. N. Zealand 1 (1961) 254—281]. Three of the New Guinea species — E. detznerianum, E. hooglandii, and E. prostratum — belong to the group Microphyllae, the fourth — E. keysseri — to the group Similes. Another species of Australia and New Zealand, E. cinereum, ranges northward to east Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands (and is also shown in this paper to be introduced in the Hawaiian Islands of Maui and Hawaii).

N2  - In a footnote to his description of Tiglium officinale Klotzsch ( Croton tiglium L.) in Hayne’s ‘Getreue Darstellung und Beschreibung der in Arzneykunde gebräuchlichen Gewächse’ 14: sub t. 3 (1843), Johann Friedrich Klotzsch (1805—60) published brief Latin diagnoses of four other species known to him from specimens at Berlin collected on the island of Luzon in the Philippines by the English traveller Hugh Cuming (1791— 1865). Klotzsch’s names for these species have been overlooked by later writers, notably by Jean Mueller (1828—96) of Aargau, who in 1865 described the same species under different names from duplicate specimens at Geneva, and by the compilers of the Index Kewensis. Cuming’s numbered exsiccatae are to be found in many herbaria; hence the correlation of Klotzsch’s and Mueller’s names, although based on different types, presents no difficulty. Mueller kept Tiglium in Croton, as have most authors. Fortunately, although Klotzsch’s names have priority over Mueller’s, no changes take place in established nomenclature as Klotzsch’s epithets cumingii, subincanum, lanceolatum, and pubescens under Tiglium have already been used under Croton for other species.Vol. 14 of Hayne’s ‘Getreue Darstellung’ was never completed. According to Botanische Zeitung 5 (1847) 206, Heft 1, tt. 1—12, was published in 1843 and Heft 2, tt. 13—24, in 1846. Klotzsch published several new names in the text to plates 3, 12, 14, 15. Linnaea vol. 34 was published in 6 parts: Heft 1—4, pp. 1—512, in 1865, Heft 5—6, pp. 513—752, in 1866. Mueller’s paper occupies pp. 1—224.

N2  - Although the Indonesian Archipelago is phycologically rather well-known, information about the freshwater algae in New Guinea is very scanty. There are only a few papers, e.g. by Bernard (1910) and Cholnoky (1963), but these give only a glimpse of the phycocoenoses of the New Guinea lakes, especially those of the high mountains. Many of these lakes have been mentioned in travel books, and some seem to be promising localities for freshwater algae.The biogeographical relations between Malesian and Australian regions have been much discussed. A number of biogeographers have attempted to unravel the complex of transition in this part of the world. Phytogeographers often accept the Torres Strait as a boundary between the Malesian and the Australian floras. This is only true in a general statistical way; the flora of the dry savannahs of the southern lowland shows a great similarity to that of northern Australia, while the high-mountain flora shows distinct affinities with both the northern temperate Asiatic flora and the temperate South Pacific flora. Zoogeographers, however, include New Guinea mostly in the Australian region because of the existence of a land-bridge between Australia and New Guinea during past geological epochs (see fig. 11—5, in Knight, 1965). In this connection the character and relations of the freshwater algal flora of New Guinea is of some interest. It has been shown by Scott  Prescott (1958) that the freshwater algal flora of northern Australia is closely related to that of the Indo-Malayan region.

Bengal 67,2: 294,1898) from Assam. In a revision of the Araliaceae of China, Li (Sargentia 2: 62—65, 1942) showed that Dendropanax listeri King, with its paniculate inflorescence, 2-celled ovary, and 2 stylar arms did not fit within the generic characters of Dendropanax Decaisne  Planch, and erected the new genus Merrilliopanax. Apart from the type species M. listeri (King) Li, he described a new species, M. chinensis, from Yunnan, China. The Subansiri plant was found to be distinct from both the earlier described species and is now described as a new species.

N2  - Allophylus, at present with c. 255 accepted species, is considered as one of the largest genera of the Sapindaceae. It is distributed throughout the tropics of the Old and the New World, and shows a wide ecological range. Although somewhat variable in vegetative characters, there is a striking homogeneity in fertile characters, by which the generic disposition is easily spotted all over the world.Specific delimitation is renowned difficult in this genus (chapter 2). An analysis of the revision given by Radlkofer in his monograph of the Sapindaceae in ‘Das Pflanzenreich’, Heft 98 (1931—34) reveals that the characters, accepted by him as diagnostic, are all extremely vague, and often grading or overlapping. Of course, the species defined by these characters in most cases appeared to be hardly better (chapter 3).A revision of the genus brought to light that in all three tropical areas the picture is dominated by one central species against which most of the others can not sharply be delimited. Moreover, these three complexes have much in common and appear to be connected by several pairs of mutually hardly separable species. This made it virtually impossible to divide the complex on the specific level (chapter 4).In chapter 5 some theoretical considerations have been given on the possible background of such a widely spread and variable complex. A definite conclusion on this background could not be reached. Phenetically, only one species is accepted, which is named Allophylus cobbe (L.) Raeusch. (chapter 6).It is advised to designate the locally recognizable forms as ‘races’, defined as ‘a population or a group of populations which in a restricted area is morphologically (hence probably genetically), mostly ecologically, and sometimes geographically fully or at least to appreciable degree separable from other such entities’. These races should preferably be named informally by adding in brackets and parentheses either a specific epithet or some ecological, geographic, or morphological designation.In chapter 8 an alphabetical enumeration is given of all the names which either have been accepted by Radlkofer, or were mentioned by him but not evaluated, or were overlooked by him, or published later. With every name critical remarks are made as to possible relationships and, if necessary, nomenclature.

N2  - According to current generic delimitations, supported by wood anatomy, palynology, and recent molecular phylogenies, Antirhea, traditionally treated as a Pantropical genus, is instead restricted to the Paleotropics. At the same time, the Neotropical species traditionally positioned in Antirhea should be positioned in Stenostomum. Following these definitions, Stenostomum is a genus with most of the species present in the Caribbean Region, and two species present in the Guianas, namely S. acreanum and S. guianensis, distributed throughout the Amazon Basin. In addition, according to these new generic delimitations, two species previously positioned in Guettarda and Antirhea need to be transferred to Chomelia, as C. triflora and C. ulei.

N2  - In chapter I the systematical position of Gaertnera is discussed and arguments are given for its arrangement in the Rubiaceae-Psychotrieae as well as the characters by which it can be distinguished from Psychotria. In chapter 2, section a, the morphology is explained of the various types of inflorescence and their derivation. It appeared that in most species the inflorescence is fairly characteristic. In G. vaginans, however, it gradingly varies from widely paniculate to condensed and from very profuse to depauperate. Section b offers new interesting data on the three types of flowers, bisexual and heterostylic, bisexual and homostylic, and unisexual-dioecious. Each individual plant carries only one kind of flowers. These kinds of flowers have within the genus also a distinct geographical significance: bisexual-heterodistylic flowers are peculiar to all Ceylonese and African species, possibly also to the Madagascan ones, whereas all Indo-Malesian species are dioecious, G. vaginans excepted. G. vaginans possesses in Africa and Ceylon bisexual-heterodistylic flowers, in Indo-Malesia dioecious flowers, and in some local Bornean populations bisexual flowers without heterodistylism. Section b contains further an evaluation of distinctive characters of other floral parts. Section c, on fruit and seed, shows the great uniformity of these in all species, except those of the Madagascan area. Sections d and e deal with the bracts and stipular sheath and their structure. Section f is devoted to the leaf, the size of which is hardly of specific value, but the indument does. On poor sandy soils and on ridges and summits leaves appear smaller and thicker.Chapter 3 embraces a discussion of the distribution; one species, G. vaginans, is covering the entire range of the genus, from West Africa to Borneo, included Madagascar. The greatest species density is found in Madagascar and the Mascarenes where all species, except G. vaginans, are endemic. Ceylon has 4 endemic species of which two may prove to be races of one. In Malaya and Borneo 7 endemic species occur, whilst G. vaginans covers all this area including also scattered localities in Thailand and Indochina. All Malesian, Ceylonese, and presumably all African species are mutually related and share with the omnipresent G. vaginans the same kind of fruit. Most of the Madagascan species, however, are different in this respect and this leads to the view that the Madagascan area is probably the primary distributional centre. From this centre G. vaginans emanated which must be the ancestral species of all others outside the Madagascan area. The likeliness of this assumption is derived from the fact that its range is enormous and its plasticity greatest among all other species. The fact that its floral dimorphism from Ceylon westward to Africa is opposed to its dioecism in Indo-Malesia, leads to the view that the former part of the area is more ancient than the latter, and that the proportionally youngest extension of the genus was from Ceylon eastward towards continental Asia and Malesia, in which a secondary centre of speciation was formed.The special part comprises the taxonomical treatment with a key to and descriptions of 12 species, among which 2 are new ( G. fractiflexa and G. globigera from Borneo). A fairly large number of names has been reduced, 6 to G. oblanceolata, 14 to G. vaginans among which several from continental Asia and one from Africa; they are both rather variable species and in the first a new variety, in the latter a new subspecies is recognized.G. divaricata from Ceylon which was mostly reduced to varietal rank is reinstated as a species. The widest spread and commonest species was mostly called G. koenigii but its proper name is G. vaginans as already recognized by Merrill in 1921.Among the excluded taxa there are several new reductions, mostly to Psychotria: G. australiana C. T. White, G. rufinervis Stapf, and G. violascens Ridl. are all Psychotrias, but pending a revision of the latter genus I have refrained from making recombinations as they may easily appear to be superfluous. G. lasianthoides C. E. C. Fischer is reduced to Psychotria rhinocerotis Bl.; G. hongkongensis Seem, is a Randia.

N2  - During a precursory study in the genus Saraca it became evident that the number of fertile stamens and the size and degree of persistency of the bracteoles are major characters in the delimitation of the species.The genus extends from India and Ceylon to S.W. China and Tonkin, and as far east as to Celebes. The Celebes material (4 collections) was found to represent a species new to science. In the group with 6—8(—10) stamens, and with small (2—8 mm long) bracteoles, of which the Indian material was hitherto mostly referred to Saraca indica L., it appeared that two species are concerned, viz.: I. Bracteoles erect, clasping the pedicel, persistent. India, Ceylon, E. Pakistan, Burma west of the Irrawaddy River; otherwise cultivated. Fig. 1A Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde, comb. nov. 1.

N2  - Saraca is one of the few genera of Caesalpinoideae not yet revised for Malesia. The genus extends in continental SE. Asia from India to SW. China, and in Malesia from Sumatra eastwards to Celebes (but is curiously absent from the Philippines). It was more or less revised as a whole by Prain (1897).During the course of the work it soon became clear that for a good understanding of the Malesian species the entire genus should be revised. The variability in hairiness, in colour of the flowers, and in number of leaf pairs, appeared to be far greater than accounted for in literature. This has led in the past to a fairly large number of names based on unreliable characters and misunderstanding of taxa.

N2  - Zollinger, Plantae Javanicae n. 1254, collected ‘in sylvis umbrosis M. Pulusari’, and distributed as Carex indica L., is a mixture of two related but clearly distinct Carices both belonging in Section Indicae. This was already known to Steudel, who worked up Zollinger’s Cyperaceae and described part of the 1254 collection as a new species in his Synopsis (16, p. 207): ‘Carex commixta. Steud. Radice valide fibrosa; culmo triquetro glabro laevi toto fere vaginato et foliato (3-pedali), basi vaginis efoliatis brevibus ovato-lanceolatis et foliiferis vestito; foliis lanceolatis elongatis latis (ultra pedalibus, 4—7”’ latis) striatis pallidis subglaucescentibus margine scaberrimis ; paniculis axillaribus et terminali, omnibus pedunculatis simplicibus; radiis remotis alternis distiche iterum remotiuscule spiculatis; spiculis sessilibus a basi floriferis, subteretibus acutis basi bracteolis 1—2 setaceis munitis ; squamis pallidis oblongis striatulis nervo medio in mucronem extenuato ; fructu lanceolato scabrato squamam aequante. Cum Carici indica commixta in Hrbro Zoll. Mor. nr. 1254. Carici Horsfieldii Boott videtur affinis. Java.’ Before he published this new species, Steudel must have informed Zollinger about it, for in the latter’s Verzeichniss (17, p. 60), issued earlier than Steudel’s Synopsis, H(erbarium normale) 1254 is still mentioned as Carex indica L., but Carex commixta, here published as a nomen nudum, is given a new number: ‘HZ (= Herb, propr. Zoll.) 1502, ex Pr. Bandong.’ The original description of Carex commixta is almost literally and without comment copied in Miquel’s Flora Indiae Batavae (8, p. 349), but the name is not accounted for in Koorders’s Exkursionsflora (5) nor in the emergency edition of Backer’s Flora van Java (1). In Kükenthal’s Carex-monograph (7, p. 273) it is cited in the synonymy of Carex horsfieldii Boott. To Nelmes (10, p. 267) the very immature specimen of Zollinger 1254 in the Zürich Herbarium, which appears to be a form of the polymorphous Carex rafflesiana Boott, seemed to be the plant described as Carex commixta, so that the broad-leaved specimen of this number in the British Museum must have been misidentified by Steudel as Carex indica. Consequently Nelmes referred Carex commixta to the synonymy of C. rafflesiana (10, p. 290), and maintained the name C. blepharolepis Nelmes for the broad-leaved plant. The last name was published in 1946 (9, p. 18 in nota) with the short diagnosis: ‘afinis C. spatiosae Boott, sed squamis femineis brevioribus glabris, utriculis brevioribus, praecipue differt. Type: Van Steenis 5457. Priangan, Java.’ To me, on the contrary, it seemed diat Steudel’s description fits rather the specimen in the British Museum than Carex rafflesiana, which has linear leaves. Broad, lanceolate leaves are but seldom found in Carex, and they are extremely rare in Indocarices. Besides, the said specimen is characterized by its short, ovate-lanceolate cataphylls at the stembase, the pale-glaucescent leaves, the open inflorescence, and the pale glumes, characters mentioned in the description, but not to be found in C. rafflesiana. I supposed that Steudel, after having separated the specimens with broad leaves from those with linear ones, considered the former a new species and took the latter for C. indica (see his description of this species, l.c.). My supposition was confirmed by the three specimens of Zollinger 1254 in the Paris Herbarium. One of them is a narrow-leaved, immature plant labelled in Zollinger’s handwriting: ‘1254. E.B. Im Schatten des Waldes auf dem Pulusari bis oben. Cyperaceae. An = V 43‘. This is indeed Carex rafflesiana Boott. The two broad-leaved specimens belong to what Nelmes described as Carex blepharolepis. One of them was determined by Spach as Carex spatiosa Boott, the other one (fig. 1), originally forming part of Steudel’s private herbarium, bears a label in Steudel’s handwriting: ‘Carex commixta Steud. Carici indica erat adjecta. Carici Horsfieldii Boott videtur maxime affinis. — Ego nec C. indicam nec C. commixtam possideo cum utriusque unicum adsit specimen. St.’ This was probably a personal information to Zollinger, who added the new number of his Verzeichniss (1502 Z) and presented Steudel with the specimen which is undoubtedly the holotype of Carex commixta. An error must have crept into Steudel’s statement that the leaves are 4—7 lines wide, for actually they are about 1½ – 2½ cm (14-7”’?) wide. This error may have led Nelmes to take the narrow-leaved specimens of Zollinger 1254 for Carex commixta. Boeckeler (2, p. 349), like Spach, determined the broad-leaved Zollinger specimen in the Berlin Herbarium (1284 is obviously a printer’s error for 1254) as Carex spatiosa Boott. Steudel’s name was either unknown to him or — what is more likely — deliberately omitted. This determination is perfectly justifiable. Boott’s type specimen of Carex spatiosa, Gaudichaud 67 from Indo-China in the Paris Herbarium, the description (3, p. 86), and the excellent plate 246 accompanying the description, leave no doubt that Carex commixta, if not conspecific with C. spatiosa, is very near to it. The name Carex spatiosa for a Javan Carex turns up again in Clarke’s ‘List of the Carices of Malaya’ (4, p. 12). The record is based on a Kurz specimen in the Kew Herbarium, which is certainly conspecific with Carex commixta. Clarke distinguished it from typical C. spatiosa as ‘var. bogorensis; utriculis ovoideis; rostro cum ½ — 2/3 parte utriculi aequilongo, scabro.’ Remains therefore the question whether the Javan Carex commixta (1855) and the Indo-Chinese C. spatiosa (1860) are specifically distinct. Comparison of Nelmes’s long and very detailed description of C. spatiosa (12, p. III) with that of C. blepharolepis (10, p. 265) results in no other noteworthy differences than the following: in the former the glumes are said to be about 2 mm long, adpressed-hispidulous, ciliolate-erose round the apex, and the utricles 5—6 mm long inclusive of the 2—3 mm long beak; in the latter the glumes are described as being 2—3 mm long (see, however, the original diagnosis!), ciliolate-erose especially at the apex, and the utricles 4—5 mm long inclusive of the 1½ —2 mm long beak. In the Indo-Chinese collections at my disposal I find the utricles on the whole, but not always, slightly longer than in the Malesian plants mainly because of the slenderer beak, and the glumes usually somewhat more hairy. Evaluation of those slight differences is of course subjective; to my mind there is no reason whatever to accept C. C. commixta and C. spatiosa as specifically or even varietally distinct. Recently Raymond (15, p. 255 f. 1) described Carex smitinandii from N. Thailand, ‘close to C. spatiosa Boott and C. balansae Franch. of French Indo-China, both bearing wide leaves and an open panicle.’ In the Leyden isotype ( Smitinand 7046), which is obviously better developed than the holotype, I fail to see noticeable differences with the Malesian specimens of Carex commixta. In the Malesian plants the utricles are 4—5 mm long, in Smitinand 7046 about 4 mm, not 3 mm as was stated in the original description (see, however, his f. 1). I have not seen Carex chuniana Wang  Tang, C. humbertii Wang  Tang, and C. hypolytrifolia Koyama, which are all referred to the synonymy of C. spatiosa Boott by Raymond (14, p. 40). As to C. hypolytrifolia, I doubt whether this reduction is right. From Koyama’s description I might infer that it belongs in Sect. Mapaniifoliae and is either C. helferi Boeck. or a closely allied species. Carex commixta appears to be a rare species of primary—and less frequently secondaryforests, known from Hainan, Burma, N. Thailand, Tonkin, Annam, S. Sumatra, and W. Java. For an enumeration of the collections see Nelmes (10, 11, 12) and Raymond (14, 15)Carex commixta Steud., Syn. 2 (1855) 207. — Type: Java: Zollinger Pl. Jan. 1254 p.p. typ. (= HZ 1502) (P).

N2  - In a recent paper by Mrs. Gray [J. Arnold Arb. 43 (1962) 74] a new species of Podocarpus was proposed from Morotai, P. filicifolius. Inasmuch as the description of the leaves corresponds exactly with juvenile P. vitiensis (not previously reported from the Moluccas) and the description of the fruit corresponds exactly with P. blumei (whose range includes the Moluccas), it was of interest to confirm whether the fruit in question was attached to the foliage material described. An examination of the specimen ( Kostermans 1949), in Leyden revealed that the fruit was collected separately and that sterile specimens of P. blumei were also collected in the general vicinity ( Kostermans 1660, 50 m).Dr. van Steenis kindly wrote to Dr. Kostermans concerning the particulars of the collection of these specimens. Kostermans writes: ‘Kostermans 1215 of G. Pare-Pare, 1000 m (apparently the same as the unnumbered specimen in Leiden), I picked from a sterile treelet c. 3 m high. There is an unidentified specimen of it in Herb. Bog., which looks to me like P. vitiensis.’ ‘Kostermans 1660 is also sterile. I remember to have cut a large tree in Morotai which fell into a ravine after cutting and remained out of reach; that was a Podocarpus and presumably we have picked some fruits from the ground.’ ‘I quite well remember the collecting of P. vitiensis on top of G. Pare-Pare; almost all of it (?) was sterile, but still I found it necessary to collect samples. P. neriifolius was certainly on this ridge, but no P. blumei.

N2  - Because of their size Platyceriums are in herbaria represented mostly by fragmentary specimens; often only nest-fronds or foliage fronds are represented in a mostly mutilated form. This, and the difficulty of placing Plukenet’s pre-Linnean protologue and plate, the independent description of Platycerium alcicorne by both Willemet and Swartz, and the various interpretations of three of Desvaux’s four species, have led to great confusion on identity and typification. P. alcicorne Desv. (new name, 1827) is accepted as the correct name for the Madagascar and East African species. It is lectotypified by Plukenet’s phrase-name Neuroplatyceros, etc. of which the type specimen after which the plate was drawn is in the Sloane Herbarium, London. P. stemaria (Beauv.) Desv. is a species from West Africa; type material is in the De Jussieu Herbarium at Paris.P. angustatum Desv. is an Australian species of which the type is in the Paris Herbarium; its correct name is P. bifurcatum (Cav.)

N2  - In the course of a revision of the Malesian genera included by Radlkofer (Pfl. Reich Heft 98, 1932) in the Sapindaceae-Aphanieae and Lepisantheae, attention had to be paid to the genus Phoenicimon Ridl. Ridley described it in the Sapindaceae and expressed its supposed relationships more precisely by giving it the number 7A, between 7 Lepisanthes and 8 Otophora, and by adding the note ‘Apparently most nearly allied to Otophora .... ’ A study of both syntypes of Phoenicimon rubiginosus Ridl., the only species, and of some more specimens revealed its true identity as a species of Glycosmis in the Rutaceae. This identification was confirmed by Dr. C. G. G. J. van Steenis and by Dr. R. C. Bakhuizen van den Brink.

N2  - A recent survey of mangroves in New Caledonia located 7 taxa of the genus Rhizophora – with 6 coexisting in one estuary. This is arguably the greatest concentration of co-occurring Rhizophora taxa anywhere. Two are well-known mangrove species of the Indo West Pacific, R. stylosa and R. apiculata, and another, R. samoensis resembles the widespread Atlantic East Pacific species, R. mangle. The other four are hybrid intermediates, R. × lamarckii (= R. stylosa × R. apiculata), R. × selala (= R. stylosa × R. samoensis), and two previously undescribed combinations, R. × tomlinsonii (R. apiculata × R. samoensis) and R. samoensis var. neocaledonica (= R. samoensis × R. × selala). The new entities are unknown elsewhere. While R. × tomlinsonii is considered endemic to New Caledonia, R. samoensis var. neocaledonica may occur elsewhere based on the co-distribution of putative parental taxa. All seven Rhizophora are described with new observations on their morphology and ecology, distribution maps, plus a revised key for the region.

N2  - A complete revision is given of the Indo-Malesian genus Cratoxylum. The subdivision of the genus into 3 sections, as given by Engler (1925) and Corner (1939), has been found correct. The characters by which these sections are discriminated concern the interpetiolar scars on the twig, the type of venation, the occurrence of petal-scales and their shape and size, the shape of the hypogynous scales alternating with the three staminal phalanges, and whether the seeds are surrounded by a wing or are winged on one side only. Each section contains two species.A concise review has been given about the history of the genus, an account of the uses made of it, and the ecology. It appears that almost all species can act as pioneers for which they are fully qualified by their euredaphic requirements and early and abundant seed production. Though some species, notably C. arborescens and C. glaucum, are evergreen, and C. formosum is deciduous, the others are not specifically one or the other way round; in C. maingayi Corner noted that sometimes particular branches shed their leaf. There is no major correlation between leaf-shedding species and seasonal climate regime.A brief summary is given on the morphology, in particular the structure of the inflorescence. Two points have not become entirely clarified, for example, whether all species are always heterodistylous: this should be studied further in the field. Another point is the want of more exact data on the degree in which the ovary is incompletely celled which seems to differ from one species to another, and to compare this with the ovary of the allied Madagascan genus Eliaea (vide infra).C. glaucum excepted all species show a distinct variability. In three species this is grading and no infraspecific taxa can be distinguished in a key on the basis of herbarium material. Within Malesia the variability is more or less of a geographical character and could be classified under clinal variation. This is also the case in C. sumatranum and C. formosum, within which I can distinguish, however, three and two infraspecific taxa respectively, which accordingly have been given racial rank, that is, as subspecies. Within each a still finer distinction might be feasible of subsubraces which mostly coincide with separate islands of Malesia.The closest related genus is the monospecific genus Eliaea Camb. from Madagascar with which it forms a tribe of the Guttiferae. With regard to the exact structure of the ovary claimed to be distinct from that of Cratoxylum a close comparative-morphological study should be made of the ontogeny of the ovary in Eliaea and all species of Cratoxylum.Except from taxa described by Loureiro, Jack, and Blanco, of whose names no types seem to exist, I have for the first time examined type material of all names and checked their detail floral characters which were often not mentioned in the original diagnoses.A listed account of all numbered material on which this study was based will be published in a separate ‘Identification List’.

Néerl. 1 (1851) 126, was taken up as a synonym, printed in italics, because the generic name Stalagmites was referred to Garcinia. However, no transfer or reduction was given for this species, but it was added ‘(sp. dub.)’.After the revision of Cratoxylum by Mr. A. J. F. Gogelein was in print it was found that among odd unlocalized sheets there was the type of this species, ticketed by Miquel himself. It is in the Utrecht Herbarium, sheet 112525B. It appears to have been collected in South China by B. Krone (B. Krone no. 168).

A discussion of the rationale is presented, 38 characters are studied for advanced versus primitive states, advancement indices calculated, and trends of variation discussed. The six major groups of Phipps (1966b) are maintained. The phylogeny conforms excellently with the geographical aspects of the continental drift hypothesis though it requires a greater age for the Angiosperms than is generally held to be the case.

N2  - Dr. McClure’s studies on the bamboos date from a period of service in China, at first as an Agricultural Explorer, since 1931 as a Professor of Botany at Lingnan University in Canton. On field trips in the Chinese interior and in Indo-China he collected numerous living bamboos, which were transplanted and studied in the to-day still intact Lingnan Bamboo Garden he had early established. After in 1941 the war had forced him to leave China, he studied living bamboos in the West Indies, Central and South America, and after the war in India, East Pakistan, Java, and Luzon. Being particularly interested not only in morphology, but also in taxonomy, he revised the bamboo collections of several herbaria in the United States and Europe.Proof of his comprehensive knowledge thus acquired is given in his book, which indeed brings the economically important and scientifically interesting, but for various reasons much neglected bamboos into fresh perspective. Students both in pure and applied botany will find here a wealth of information, based on the author’s personal experience as well as on his familiarity with the pertinent literature.

N2  - In the eyes of most aquarists plants have merely a decorative function in the aquarium. Several aquarists, however, have made the plants the subject of their special interest, and it is for these people that Professor De Wit actually wrote his book. In order to make it easier for them he has not followed the usual systematic arrangement of the species but has arranged the species according to their habit. The following growthforms are dealt with successively: 1. Plants freely floating on the surface; 2. Submerged but freely floating plants; 3. Rooting plants with rosettes of filiform, linear, or ribbon-shaped leaves; 4. Plants with leaf-rosettes on the bottom; 5. Rooting plants with floating leaves; 6. Plants with creeping stems and erect leaves; and 7. Plants with erect leaf-bearing stems.There are, however, many species that can be classified in more than one of these vague categories, e.g. Elisma natans, Potamogeton octandrus, many species of Sagittaria and Echinodorus, and all Ceratophyllum species. Two species, Wolffiella floridana and Riccia fluitans, are erroneously classified as plants floating on the surface; they are submerged pleustophytes.

N2  - Tapeinidium is the second largest of the Lindsaeoid fern genera. In the present study 17 species are distinguished. Until Tapeinidium was recognized as a genus its species were included in Microlepia, where it was originally described as an infrageneric division, or in Davallia. Fée (1852), then Diels (1902), treated it as a genus, but under the incorrectly interpreted name Wibelia Bernhardi, which is actually a synonym of Davallia (see Copeland, 1947).The species described so far have mainly been distinguished by their leaf architecture, especially the degree of dissection; see, e.g., van Alderwerelt van Rosenburgh (1909). In my opinion this is at best one of several useful characters. At least equally important is the structure of the petiole and the other axes of the lamina, a character diat proved to be very valuable for diagnostic purposes in the neotropical Lindsaea species (Kramer, 1957a) but is much less serviceable in the paleotropical ones. In some cases the rhizome scales are also distinctive. These characters have been grossly neglected in the past, and the species distinguished by most authors are generally far too widely circumscribed. Diels (l.c.), for example, listed three species at a time when more than twice as many were known. Accordingly there proved to be a surprisingly large number of undescribed species, viz. 8 out of the 17 recognized here, some of them represented by numerous specimens in many herbaria and collected long ago but never recognized, e.g., T. novoguineense and T. melanesicum. This contrasts sharply with the situation in Lindsaea in the same region where the number of new species is comparatively very small and relatively many more species have to be placed in synonymy.

N2  - In the Flora Malesiana area recent authors have distinguished the following genera in the Lindsaea group of ferns: Isoloma J. Smith, Lindsaea Dryander (often misspelled “Lindsaya”; see Copeland 1947, p. 53, and Kramer 1957a, p. 156), Odontosoria Fee, Protolindsaya Copeland, Schizoloma Gaudichaud (or Schizolegnia Alston), Sphenomeris Maxon, Tapeinidium (Presl) C. Christensen, and Xyropteris Kramer. In my account of the American species (Kramer 1957a) I included the Asiatic genus Schizolepton Fee in the Lindsaea group, on Copeland’s authority, without sufficiently looking into the matter. Holttum (1958) has shown since that its affinities are with Syngramma and has subsequently (1960) combined it with Taenitis, although Pichi-Sermolli (1966) denies any close affinity of the two last-named genera.As stated before (Kramer 1957a, 1967) I am convinced that Schizoloma cannot be maintained as a distinct genus and prefer to treat it as a section of Lindsaea. With regard to Isoloma I have reached the same conclusion, as explained below. Odontosoria sensu stricto does not occur in Asia. Xyropteris is still monotypical, as originally described (Kramer 1957b), and Tapeinidium, including Protolindsaya, as correctly stated by Christensen (1934), forms the subject of a separate paper (Kramer 1968). The notes in the present paper can thus be restricted to Lindsaea and Sphenomeris.

N2  - There has not been an extensive taxonomical treatment of the Lemnaceae since the publication of the famous works of Hegelmaier (1868, 1895). As the quantity of preserved and dried material of this family has increased considerably since Hegelmaier’s time, and as some new species have been described and the flowers and fruits of some other species have become known, there is, according to Daubs, a ’need for a critical review of the family in the light of this later knowledge, as well as some synthesis of the widely scattered data into a more readily available form’.I have used this revision and it must at once be praised for the clear and adequate descriptions of the taxa and the excellent, accurate drawings.

N2  - The Malvaceae have always enjoyed a vivid interest from botanists, in particular on account of the fact that many species have showy flowers and are appreciated as ornamentals throughout the world. In addition many species are of outstanding economical value, e.g. in the genera Gossypium and Hibiscus. Finally several species are weeds which have been dispersed by human agency far beyond their original areas of distribution and thus have had more chance to attract the attention of collectors.The wide variability of most species has offered annoying difficulties to botanists when trying to delimitate these species or their infraspecific taxa, resulting into an alarming accumulation of names. Despite the often painstaking studies by many botanists, either on the whole family in a restricted area, or of certain genera throughout the world, there is still a great deal of work to be done and no revision of the family has ever been made for the Malesian area.

N2  - A study of these three fern-genera has been undertaken for Flora Malesiana. Teratophyllum and Lomagramma have their main distribution in Malesia; Lomariopsis is pantropic. All three have a distribution extending to the Society and Austral Islands and to New Caledonia; all three are almost confined to the tropics, and all are found only in welldeveloped evergreen forest, so that in the Pacific they only occur on islands large enough to develop such forest. Only Teratophyllum occurs in Queensland.These ferns have a peculiar growth-habit in common. The plants have their main root-system in the ground, but climb to a considerable height up the trunks of trees, attaching themselves by roots which grow from the ventral surface of their climbing rhizomes. The fronds are always dimorphic, fertile fronds having contracted leaflets which are covered beneath with sporangia. The only other genus all species of which have a similar growth-habit is Stenochlaena (with which Lomariopsis and Teratophyllum were formerly united). Stenochlaena differs in the following characters: the rhizome is not dorsiventral in structure, and has a quite different and very complex vascular anatomy; the fertile leaflets have a distinct thin indusium-like edge; and the spores have a strongly sculptured exine lacking perispore. There is also one species of Blechnum in New Zealand which has a similar habit [B. filiforme (A. Cunn.) Ettings.]. This also has a rhizome which is not dorsiventral, but its vascular structure is much simpler than that of Stenochlaena, its fertile pinnae have more conspicuous indusium-like edges, and the spores have a smooth exine covered by perispore.

N2  - Arthropteris is a small genus of the Old World tropics (and southwards to New Zealand) the affinity of which is not clear. It shares with Oleandra and Elaphoglossum the character of outgrowths from the rhizome (phyllopodia) to which the stipes of fronds are jointed, and also has peltate rhizome-scales comparable with those of both genera. One group of species closely resembles Nephrolepis in shape and articulation of pinnae and in form and position of sori, another group has the frond-form and soral form of Thelypteris, and a third has sterile fronds so like those of Teratophyllum that they might be mistaken for that genus; the slender dorsiventral rhizome in all species is comparable with that of Teratophyllum, though the anatomy is different in detail. A remarkable feature, absent in all the other genera already mentioned, is the presence in Arthropteris of short multiseptate hairs essentially like those of Ctenitis and Tectaria; similar hairs occur in Davallodes (not in Davallia) and thus give a possible link with the Davallia group of genera (which all have dorsiventral rhizomes with articulated stipes, and peltate scales). The peculiar monotypic genus Psammisorus C. Chr. (Madagascar) shows features in common with Arthropteris and the Davallioid ferns. As regards spores, those of Nephrolepis, Oleandra, and Davallodes lack perispore, but a perispore is present in Arthropteris, Ctenitis, Teratophyllum, and Elaphoglossum.The original species of Arthropteris was the exindusiate A. tenella (Polypodium tenellum Forst.) and the genus was described by John Smith in J. D. Hooker’s Flora of New Zealand; Smith stated that there were also indusiate species which should be included in the genus. W. J. Hooker, however, did not recognize Arthropteris, and subsequently placed A. tenella in Polypodium, A. orientalis in Nephrodium, and A. palisotii in Nephrolepis. John Smith knew a large number of ferns as living plants under his care at Kew (a century ago he estimated that he had had a thousand species in cultivation, though doubtless not all at one time) and in distinguishing genera he took into consideration characters, noted from the living plants, which Hooker was not prepared to accept as significant for the purpose. I agree with Smith in accepting Arthropteris as a natural genus, and believe that its peculiar combination of characters may give significant hints as to inter-relationships among various groups of ferns, but it is not yet clear to me how such inter-relationships may best be formally expressed in a scheme of classification. Arthropteris is usually placed near Nephrolepis, but I do not think Nephrolepis is its nearest relative.

N2  - In NW. Borneo thick series of Tertiary sediments occur which are rich in fossil pollen and spores. The majority of these plant microfossils were derived from the various types of tropical lowland vegetation such as mangrove (Muller, 1964), mixed peat swamp forest and mixed Dipterocarp forest. Some pollen types, however, can be traced to microtherm elements in the montane vegetation. As these cannot have migrated through tropical lowlands, their past distribution is of special interest. It is the purpose of this note to review the stratigraphic occurrence of these montane pollen types and discuss briefly the phyto-geographical significance of the data. The sediments which contain the microfossils can be roughly divided in a near coastal and deltaic facies, characterized by alternating shale and sandstone with subordinate coal beds and a marine facies, consisting mainly of shale with subordinate sandstone and limestone beds.The Tertiary sedimentation in the NW. Borneo Basin is characterized by the alternation of these two main facies, but was locally interrupted during periods of mountain building movements, particularly in late Eocene and late Miocene time. These movements shifted the axis of the depositional basin gradually northwards. The formations of interest are the Oligocene-Miocene Nyalau formation, the Miocene Setap shale, Meligan and Lambir formations, the Miocene-Pliocene Belait formation and a group of younger formations of late Miocene-Pliocene age.

N2  - The present paper describing a new species of Mycetia Reinw. ( Rubiaceae) is based on a collection by J. L. Lister in 1874—75 and subsequently by G. King’s Collector Badul Khan in January, 1890 from Dafla Hills, NEFA. The late Dr. G. King named the taxon Adenosacme listeri King MSS which was not published. Later on I. H. Burkill in Rec. Bot. Surv. India 10 (1925) 298 named his specimens ( Burkill 36423  37321) from the Abor Hills Adenosacme listeri King without description. An examination of Burkill’s specimens in the herbarium (CAL) reveals that his collection is not conspecific with Lister’s, named by King. Very recently G. Panigrahi  S. K. Kar in Bull. Bot. Surv. India 5 (1963) 27 named a collection ( Panigrahi 19395) A. listeri King ex Burkill, probably without knowing that it was not a validly published name and that the specimen is not conspecific with Burkill’s collection, where as it is identical with Lister’s.The generic name Mycetia Reinw. has been established as the valid name for Adenosacme Wall. Studies on the genus Mycetia Reinw. suggest that Lister’s collection deserves specific status as suggested by King. Recent collection of the material indicates that the plant exists over a larger area. Hence it is considered desirable to name and describe the species. Specific name suggested by King after the first collector Lister is retained here.

N2  - This is a difficult book on account of the very wide range and complexity of its subject-matter, made more difficult by the fact that the author has not taken the trouble to arrange his writing so as to present a clear sequence of ideas; also he often uses needlessly complex sentences, some made more difficult to understand by careless proof-reading. After a first attempt to read the book through, my mind was quite confused; it was only on a second reading, by referring backwards and forwards to different chapters, that I began to have some understanding of its basic ideas. So if in this review I do not do it justice, I feel that the author will be at least in part to blame.Prof. Meeuse has made an attempt to interpret the floral morphology of flowering plants in terms of a new typology. Fie objects to the old typology of carpels and the way in which a great range of different floral structures were interpreted in terms of that typology; but he proceeds to provide a new strait-jacket of his own into which all the same structures must be fitted. He condemns the old morphology as ‘preconceived’, and frequently uses this adjective to discredit the ideas of others. But all his own theoretical ideas must have been conceived in his own mind before he could apply them in detail and give expression to them in the present book; they are therefore also pre-conceived. He should think again what he means by this word.

N2  - The subdivision of the genus as proposed by Chodat in his Monograph of the family, seventy five years ago, needs emendation. First, one of his sections, Semeiocardium (Zoll.) Hassk. must be completely reconstructed. It is typified by a singular genus Semeiocardium occurring in Madura and Kangean Is. (off NE. Java) which was described by Zollinger as a Balsaminacea, but included by Hasskarl in the Polygalaceae, in which he was followed by Chodat. Backer has indubitably shown that Zollinger’s opinion was correct and that it represents a remarkable, endemic genus of the Balsaminaceae (Gard. Bull. Str. Settl. 9, 1935, 70). For the other species included in this section a new section must be accepted which I have named Pseudosemeiocardium. Furthermore, through the type method, the sectional name Orthopolygala Chodat must be substituted by Polygala to which belongs the lectotype species of the genus, P. vulgaris L. (cf. Linné, Sp. Pl. repr. 1959, vol. 2, Steam’s index notes, p. [137]).Finally, Chodat’s first key character to the sectional subdivision, namely whether the keel is cristate or not, does not hold, because the species of sect. Pseudosemeiocardium defined as ecristate in that key, and which certainly represent a natural taxon, almost all possess a cristate keel, viz. P. malesiana, P. cardiocarpa, P. furcata; only one has an ecristate keel viz. P. tatarinowii. Provisionally, it seems to me more practical to use as first key character whether the two paired (inner) sepals are caducous or persistent. This can always be observed as in the herbarium in almost all specimens the lower flowers of at least some racemes are beyond anthesis.

N2  - Cultural experiments with Entophysalis deusta support Drouet and Daily’s concept of this species as a morphologically highly plastic taxon, showing forms traditionally identified as Entophysalis granulosa, Gloeocapsa crepidinum, Pleurocapsa fuliginosa, and Hyella caespitosa. These results are in accordance with observations on populations forming part of the ‘black zone’ of the upper intertidal belt. It is shown that Drouet and Daily’s taxonomic principles, leading to a broad and more natural concept of this species, are sounder than those underlying Geitler’s Cyanophyceae in which several entities included by them in Entophysalis deusta are treated as species.

N2  - The genus Lagenophora was first described by Cassini under the name Lagenifera (in Bull. Soc. Philomat. 12, 1816, 199) with the following diagnosis: ‘Ce genre, de la tribus des astérées, comprend le calendula magellanicá, Willd. et le bellis stipitata, Labill. Son principal caractère reside dans la cypsèle lagéniforme, comprimée, prolongée au sommet en un col qui ne porte point d’aigrette. Les fleurons sont mâles’.Two years later, in the same periodical (1818, p. 34) he changed the name Lagenifera without comment into Lagenophora, the latter being simply the latinized Greek equivalent of Lagenifera. Later authors have unanimously accepted the name Lagenophora, although Davis pointed out that Lagenifera has priority. Only recently Backer  Bakhuizen van den Brink Jr (Flora of Java 2, 1965, 381) have accepted the name Lagenifera, pointing out that this is the legitimate generic name, adding that Lagenophora is to be treated as an etymological variant. This would imply that under Lagenifera no new combinations are necessary.

Leucoanthocyanins, myricetin, gallic acid, ellagic acid, as well as alkaloids were demonstrated to occur rather frequently in this family.The relationships between the Simaroubaceae and Rutaceae and the position of the genera Irvingia and Suriana are briefly discussed: the Simaroubaceae and Rutaceae seem to be closely related not only morphologically but also biochemically.Irvingia seems to fit rather well in the Simaroubaceae (except for the assumed lack of bitter principles).Suriana deviates much more from all other species investigated. This stimulates further research to check the recent proposal of Gutzwiller concerning the classification of this genus.

N2  - During the preparation of a monograph of the genus Elaphoglossum for Flora Malesiana, I have recognized twenty-three new species; these are here described. I take this opportunity also for publishing a few comments on the genus. In both these matters I wish to acknowledge the work of Mr P. R. Bell, who began a series of morphological studies of Elaphoglossum some years ago, primarily based on species he had seen in tropical America (see Bibliography); Mr Bell also made a quite intensive study of scales and other characters of some species from Malesia, and has handed over his notes for my use; two of the species here described as new were so recognized and named by him. Most of the new species here dealt with are from New Guinea, which indoubtedly has a much larger and more varied representation of the genus than any other part of Malesia. The most important New Guinea collections are those of Dr. L. J. Brass, on successive Archbold Expeditions. In spite of the wealth of this material, we really need much more if we are to have a satisfactory understanding of the genus in that area; several of the new species are described from single collections, and such may not give a true idea of the possible range of variability (due to age of plant and to environmental factors) within a species. As I know from personal experience, Elaphoglossum plants, growing on treebranches with other epiphytes, are easy to overlook; their simple fronds are often very like leaves of orchids when seen at a distance. Probably all species of Elaphoglossum produce fertile fronds seasonally, presumably as a result of a climatic stimulus, but the nature of the stimulus has not been proved. By analogy with behaviour of other ferns which I have had under frequent observation, I think it most probable that a spell of drier weather (which quickly affects epiphytes) is the stimulus, and probably different species respond in different ways. Though most species are epiphytes, a few are reported as terrestrial, in some cases perhaps casually so; one ( E. resiniferum) is reported as growing on wet rocks in a stream-bed. Collectors usually do not make specimens from sterile plants, but good sterile material is usually quite distinctive. I wish I had myself realized this when I had the opportunity of seeing these plants in their native environment.Distribution. The genus as a whole is pantropic, and is believed to comprise more than 400 species, the majority in the New World. The present study of Malesian species brings the total in Malesia to almost 50, which indicates that the genus is more diversified in this region than in any other part of the Old World, though undoubtedly more species of mainland Asia remain to be recognized. A few Malesian species are quite widely distributed [E. angulatum (Bl.) Moore in Reunion, Ceylon, and throughout Malesia; E. callifolium (Bl.) Moore throughout Malesia and apparently to Fiji], but many appear to be rather local; however, it may be that further collections will show that some of the latter are more widely distributed than is at present known. My recent studies have indicated such cases, which will be reported in Flora Malesiana.

N2  - Several decalcifying mixtures or aqueous solutions of inorganic or organic acids are generally used for releasing algae growing in the shells of molluscs and barnacles, for instance dilute hydrochloric, nitric, citric, or acetic acid (4), a mixture of nitric acid, chromic acid and alcolhol (1), nitric acid and alcohol (9), chlorine dioxide and acetic acid (diaphanol) (3, 6, 11, 12), and formic acid and formiate (8). For a review see (7). Such mixtures or solutions generate carbondioxide bubbles that more or less disorganise the histological structure of the thallus. They also hydrolyse cell-contents and cell-wall material. Diaphanol and formiate appeared to be relatively useful for conserving the histological structure of the thalli. Recently (5, 10, 13) chelating agents, e.g. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) were introduced as histological decalcifiers. The fact that EDTA is widely used as a chelating ingredient of nutrient media for algal cultures suggested its possible use for releasing living algae growing in animal shells. However, the concentration necessary for decalcification is a multiple of that used in culture media (1 % to 5 % and 0.0005 %. respectively). It is possible to vary the pH from 5—10, in accordance with the pH of the natural habitat of the alga.

N2  - Auf Grund ihres Fruchtknotenbaues konnte die Gattung Kolkwitzia schon bei ihrer Beschreibung durch Graebner (1901a) den Linnaeeae zugeordnet werden, und zwar gehört sie nach Graebner “unmittelbar neben Linnaea”. Dabei ist freilich zu bemerken, dass Graebner (1901b) dem Vorschlage von (Braun und) Vatke (1871) folgend unter dem Gattungsnamen Linnaea die Gattungen Linnaea L. und Abelia R. Br. zusammenfasste.Als besonderes Kennzeichen der Gattung wird von Graebner hervorgehoben, dass die Ovarien der Blüten gewöhnlich paarweise miteinander verwachsen sind. Durch diese Verwachsung von Fruchtknoten je zweier benachbarter Blüten “erinnert sie an Lonicera, bei der jedoch beide auf einer Höhe stehen, während sie bei Kolkwitzia in der bisher nicht bekannten Weise, dass nämlich der eine Fruchtknoten der Spitze des andern seitlich angewachsen ist, verbunden sind”. Darüber hinaus macht Graebner weder über die Stellungsverhältnisse der miteinander verwachsenen Blüten noch über die Art der Verwachsung nähere Angaben. Im Verlaufe einer vergleichenden Untersuchung über die Infloreszenzen der Caprifoliaceen (Troll  Weberling 1966) sind wir daher auch diesen Fragen nachgegangen und erhielten dabei weitere Hinweise auf die engeren Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse von Kolkwitzia.

Smith, and S. ovata Backer. In the course of a palynological study of recent and fossil Sonneratia pollen (Muller, 1964), it was discovered that in Brunei, NW. Borneo, hybridization occurs between these species.It is the purpose of this note A. to describe the morphology of the hybrids, and B. to report on a preliminary cytological examination of the species and the hybrids for determining the chromosome numbers and for detecting irregularities in chromosome behaviour at meiosis in the hybrids.

N2  - This is the second book by professor Meeuse on the phylogenetic morphology of the reproductive organs of the Higher Cormophytes. It is superior to the first *, not only in the get-up, but also in providing some more information on the principles of the author. The core is disclosed in: ‘all we can do is to postulate a phylogenetic genealogy, using all available (palaeobotanical) evidence, and build up the evolutionary sequences in the phylogeny of the organs, the semophyleses, along our framework’. And: ‘Typology is to be checked by fossil data’. We meet the method of the New Morphology, as it was started by H. Hamshaw Thomas.The phylogenetic line depicted leads from the Progymnospermopsida Beck through Cycadopsid Gymnosperms towards Angiosperms. It is impossible to distinguish Angiosperms from Gymnosperms. They are specialised Cycadopsid Gymnosperms, exhibiting polyrheitric angiospermic trends, such as angi-ovuly, double fertilisation, dormant embryo phase, flower types, wood vessels, and aperturate pollen. Some groups have not reached the ultimate level in part of these characters.

N2  - The present study was originally intended to be a taxonomic revision of the genus Pygeum (Rosaceae). This genus was always considered to be closely related to, but different from Prunus. However, the delimitation of Pygeum against Prunus subg. Laurocerasus appeared to be extremely difficult, and after careful consideration I was compelled to reduce Pygeum to Prunus. This reduction is the most radical taxonomic novelty in the present paper (Chapter 3).A new subdivision of subg. Laurocerasus, now enriched with Pygeum, was inevitable. Three sections are distinguished here, viz.: a. sect. Laurocerasus, containing the Eurasian and tropical Asiatic species which were already considered by older authors to belong to the (sub)genus Laurocerasus, and moreover the two African species of the former genus Pygeum; b. a still unnamed section containing the tropical and subtropical American species of the subgenus; c. sect. Mesopygeum, containing the large majority of the species of the former genus Pygeum.

N2  - Euthales filiformis de Vriese (7) was described from a specimen collected in Western Australia ‘in solo sublimoso fertili prope praedium rusticum Dom. Marell, York d. 30 m. Martii 1840. Herb. Preiss No. 1889.’ As appears from the original description de Vriese himself had already his doubts about its belonging to Euthales, a Goodeniaceous genus: ‘dichotoma, filiformis; foliis radicalibus squamaeformibus, caulibus ramisque aphyllis; calycibus 5-fidis, subaequalibus (Caetera non vidi). Habitus Junci bufonii, sed genus dubium.’ In a later publication of de Vriese (8) the calyx is said to be trifid, but this is obviously a printing error.It is a matter of course that Bentham (2), who had not seen the plant, was unable to recognize it from this very inadaequate diagnosis, and supposed that it might belong to some quite different genus. On what grounds the Index Kewensis (4) referred Euthales filiformis to the synonymy of Velleia trinervis (R.Br.) Labill. (= Euthales trinervis R. Br.), with which species it certainly has nothing to do, is unknown to me. There is a short note on Euthales filiformis in Krause’s monograph on the Goodeniaceae (5), which gives nothing new as it simply goes back to Bentham’s observation, but apart from this I have not found de Vriese’s species mentioned in more recent literature. Its name is not accounted for in Gardner’s enumeration of West Australian plants (3).

N2  - In Taxon 10 (1961) 261, a proposal was published to conserve the generic name of the Papuan genus Phyllocharis Diels, 1917, against Phyllocharis Fée, Essai Crypt. (1824) lix, xciv, t. ii, fig. 3  7, a name for a genus of Lichens. Fée was the only author who ever recognized it; it was reduced by Montagne about 15 years later and this reduction was accepted by all later lichenologists. As a matter of fact an experienced lichenologist was one of the three botanists who endorsed the proposal by undersigning it. Therefore, no harm would have come from accepting the proposal and this would have been distinctly useful for stabilizing the generic name Phyllocharis in the Campanulaceae, not only for the few botanists working in New Guinea, but for all handbooks and monographs on the family. It is precisely for this purpose that there is the provision in the Rules to conserve generic names. No useful purpose is pursued to drop established names if it is reasonable to maintain them, which I strongly think it is in this case. The proposal has unfortunately been found redundant by the majority of the Subcommittee for Phanerogams (Taxon 12, 1963, 238) and was rejected. This necessitates the creation of a new generic name and the transfer of the epithets.Ruthiella Steen. nom. nov. — Phyllocharis Diels, Bot. Jahrb. 55 (1917) 122, non Fée, 1824; Wimmer, Pfl.

It is suggested that S. furcigera and S. saxatilis should be regarded as synonyms of S. fusca. It was found that S. fusca also forms bifurcate propagulae in contrast to reports in the literature. Cultures were grown of S. plumigera, S. fusca, S. britannica, and S. radicans. The cultures of S. fusca, S. britannica, and S. radicans exhibited very feebly fixed polarity in contrast to the cultures of S. plumigera.S. cirrosa and S. fusca are considered to be two different species.

N2  - In our revision of Caprifoliaceae in Fl. Mal. I, 4 (1951) 175 seq. we omitted to mention Weigelia fallax described by Miquel from Lembang, West Java, collected by Korthals. The specimen was concealed among cultivated specimens and turned up recently. There is no doubt that this specimen is derived from an ornamental in the Javanese hills.We have sent this material to Prof. Hara who found it conspecific with Weigela coraeensis Thunb. It is often cultivated in Japan, especially as a hedge plant.

N2  - Foxworthy and Symington published revisions of the dipterocarp family for the Philippines (11 genera, 52 species) and Malaya (14 genera, 168 species) in 1938 and 1943 respectively. From 1926 till 1961 van Slooten published revisions of several genera for Indonesia, but knowledge of the largest genera, Shorea and Hopea, and of the island with the greatest number of species, Borneo, remained defective. Plans were developed by the Forestry Departments of Sarawak, Brunei, and Sabah, to fill the gap in a coordinated effort, of which this book is the first substantial result. A first precursory paper with new species appeared in Gard. Bull. Sing. 19 (1962) 253—319, a second, with taxonomic and nomenclatural discussion in vol. 20 (1963) 229—284. A Manual for Sabah, by W. Meijer, is in the press, one for Sarawak, also by Ashton, in preparation. When these are finished, the 72 species listed by Symington for Sumatra are still to be investigated, as well as the rich materials collected by Kostermans in Indonesian Borneo; then a comprehensive revision for the whole of Malesia can be written.This book means one more step towards the clearing up of the difficult tribe of the Shoreeae. The author suggests that eventually all genera save Parashorea thereof may be merged to one, objecting against elevation of the present sections in Shorea to the rank of genus. In this book are recognized Upuna (1 sp.), Anisoptera (4 spp.), Dipterocarpus (22 spp.), Dryobalanops (4 spp.), Cotylelobium (3 spp.), Vatica (19 spp.), Parashorea (4 spp.), Hopea (19 spp.), Shorea (73 spp.); this makes for Brunei 151 species, 41 of which were described after 1957. Shorea trees seldom produce the flowers on which the taxonomic subdivision is based, and foresters have developed a (largely concurrent) subdivision into Field Groups, based on bark (recently studied by Whitmore), slash, stipules, and other vegetative characters.

N2  - It is with deep regret that I have to announce here the passing away of the Chief of the Technical Staff of the Rijksherbarium, WABE WIERINGA, at the age of 60 years.Born at Rauwerd, in the north of the Netherlands, in the province of Friesland, he was a genuine Frisian, of the Nordic race, possessing its good qualities, tall, strong, honest, devoted to work, and diligent in organizing. Always ready for a joke or a laugh he was a most pleasant man to meet and to have on the staff, praised by his directors and scientific staff members and respected and trusted by his own personnel whom he would always shield and whose interests he would always keep at heart. I am very certain that the many visiting scientists he met in his long term of service will have a similar memory of his personality in solliciting his help with their work in our collections.

N2  - In order to test the applicability of the telome and the classic theories to the nature of stamens a study was made of flowers in Malvaceae, Bombacaceae, Sterculiaceae, Tiliaceae, and Elaeocarpaceae with respect to their ultimate form, their development, and the vascular course of their androecia. The customary dissecting, clearing, and microtomy techniques were used. A chapter on the interpretation of the vascular bundle course in floral morphology has been added.In each flower the stamens are considered to be arranged in five groups, which may be fused more or less laterally. The groups have a three-trace vascular system the laterals of which may be commissural. Only a few Tiliaceae have ten groups.Whereas in most Tiliaceae and Elaeocarpaceae the groups are antesepalous, in Malvaceae, Bombacaceae, and Sterculiaceae they are either antesepalous, antepetalous, or intermediate, depending on the variation of a spiral growth in the floral apex. If there is no such growth the groups are antepetalous. Spiral growth is revealed by an oblique course of the vascular bundle traces and the asymmetrical form of the petals and stamen groups.The stamen groups may have many stamens (Tiliaceae) or bear fewer stamens in a fan-like arrangement, in which case they are called either staminal lobes (Malvaceae and Bombacaceae) or, if they are less welldeveloped, phalanges (Sterculiaceae and many Elaeocarpaceae). Since they have their own group primordia, which show a certain phyllotaxis, the stamen groups are considered to be individual in nature. Moreover, in Bombax and allied genera and in some Malvaceae the apical regions of the staminal lobes originate free and are phyllomic in appearance.Three parts can be distinguished in each stamen group: one median upper and two lateral outer parts, corresponding with the three-trace vascular system. The upper part is often formed by a few stamens in Tiliaceae and by a single stamen or a staminodial part in Bombacaceae and Sterculiaceae; in Malvaceae it is reduced. Judging by the sub-group primordia, here called staminal buttresses, the lateral parts are considered to have a certain individuality; in some Malvaceae and very markedly so in Pachira spp. the staminal buttresses arise on the staminal lobes to form the lateral parts of the stamen groups. The parts have many stamens, arranged spatially (in Tiliaceae and Pachira spp.), or fewer stamens occurring as simple rows (mainly in Malvaceae and Sterculiaceae). Between the two an intergradated series of forms can be found, e.g., in Bombax and allied genera and in some Malvaceae. In some cases the lateral parts are formed by a single stamen or even a single theca.The position of the carpels depends upon the position of the stamen groups. The carpels alternate with those regions of the stamen groups the development of which is the most advanced when the carpel primordia arise.The parts of the groups as well as the groups as a whole may formerly have been freer but they have been reduced by congenital fusion and partial incorporation in the main floral axis. Evidence for this interpretation is provided by some Tiliaceae with ten freer stamen groups that may be visible either when mature (Mollia speciosa) or only in an early phase of development (Colona spp.). In Mollia speciosa the antepetalous groups are collaterally double, so that they may be regarded as the lateral parts of triple arrangements. In the Colona spp. the antepetalous groups are obscured during ontogeny by secondary receptacular growth. Moreover, if at the same time reduction occurs in the median line of these groups, their lateral parts are assimilated by the adjoining antesepalous groups. What can happen during ontogeny (postgenitally) may equally well happen (congenitally) before the primordia become visible externally.The stamens may represent slightly flattened syntelomic structures. Depending on the time the division process begins, in Malvaceae and Bombacaceae a monothecous stamen primordium can be more or less deeply divided, forming two equal halves with facing xylem. In Malvaceae this dividing process may operate up to three times in succession; the products of the division are all arranged in one plane. Still further divisions may occur in Adansonia digitata and Durio spp.; in that case the results are arranged spatially, though in Durio not in an adaxial median direction. The mesomes occur either free, especially in Durio, or fused. This successive pairing of mesomes cannot be explained by connation of stamens. Under the influence of reduction superficial division gives rise to a bithecous stamen. Partitioned pollen sacs can be considered as due to imperfect division. The nature of several kinds of sterile extensions has been discussed. In Sterculiaceae and Tiliaceae the stamens of many species are resupinate.In some species the lateral margins of the staminal lobes form only a few sessile thecae (Matisieae). In still others (Fremontia californica, Chorisia and Ceiba spp.) each margin immediately forms a single continuous theca each, the primordial staminal lobes being distinctly foliar in appearance. In this way each entire staminal lobe forms a single flattened bithecous stamen with a sterile apical part and a three-trace vascular system. It is precisely these characteristics that the classic theory regards as primitive in stamens. Moreover, it follows that in Mahales bithecous stamens can be structures of two different ranks.Consequently in the androecia of this group of taxa a series of transitions exists between more branched and more foliar formations. In this series reduction operates by the loss of parts, by congenital fusion, by incorporation and by flattening. The androecial parts are neither fully stachyosporous nor fully phyllosporous; they are transitory between the two.

N2  - Stamen position in Loranthaceae is summarized in both the Old and New Worlds. In the former, stamens are inserted on petals at the same height in an individual flower, with very few exceptions that appear to be in basalmost genera only. In the Americas, much diversity exists in both the position and the within-flower shapes of stamens, phenomena that occur in many genera, Psittacanthus showing the greatest diversity. The dimorphic, or at least the biseriate condition is believed to be the plesiomorphic state. Some comments are added on petal numbers in the family.

N2  - In my revision of the genus Canarium (Blumea 9, 1959, p. 275—475), C. schweinfurthii was included in sect. Canarium and within this section in the denticulatum-group (see p. 382). The main arguments for giving it that position were: 1. its general resemblance in several characters with sect. Canarium, more specially the apparent morphological equality of its stipules, a key character in the genus; 2. its apparent relationship to C. madagascariense Engl. the inclusion of which in the denticulatum-group is beyond any doubt, and, 3., its geographical position at the end of the chain of species forming the denticulatum-group — from W. Malesia to E. Africa, C. schweinfurthii being restricted to W. and Central Africa — without any connection to other groups of the genus (sect. Pimela does not go farther to the west than the Malabar coast of India). Still, it was not without doubt that I put it into this position. I expressed my doubts most clearly on p. 314—315, pointing to the presence on the one hand of some apparently primitive characters — in fact more primitive than could be expected in case of a direct derivation from the western chain of species of the denticulatum-group — as e.g. the axillary inflorescence and the presence of a rather strongly developed pistillode in the ♂ flower, of some doubtless highly evolved characters on the other hand, like the deeply concave receptacle in the ♀ flower and the ‘androphore’ in the ♂ one. Hence I concluded that the species ‘must have been isolated for a very long time’.Recently, morphological and blastogenetical studies brought new evidence as to the systematical position of C. schweinfurthii. From both it became quite clear, that the ‘stipules’ are not at all comparable with those of sect. Canarium, but are homologous with the pseudo-stipules of sect. Pimela; there is no doubt that they are derived from a pair of leaflets. The germination, however, which seems to provide good characters on sectional level in Canarium, differed from both sect. Canarium and sect. Pimela: the cotyledons were herbaceous long-lasting assimilating-organs like in sect. Pimela, but the first two leaves formed a pair of opposite pseudo-cotyledons like in sect. Canarium, and the restingperiod came after the unfolding of the latter two, also like in sect. Canarium. A more detailed discussion of these morphological points will be given elsewhere (Weberling  Leenhouts, in press).

N2  - When revising the acrostichoid genera Bolbitis and Egenolfia from the Old World for my thesis, I came across Acrostichum neglectum F. M. Bail. This species, which was successively transferred to the genera Leptochilus and Campium, has the essential characters of a blechnoid fern. On account of the differences found between A. neglectum and the other blechnoid ferns, it seems necessary to create a new genus to accommodate it, a point of view shared by Prof. Holttum, who gave me valuable advice for this study.I am indebted to Mr L. S. Smith of the Botanic Museum and Herbarium, Brisbane, for the loan of the collections of this species, to Mr J. H. Kern, who kindly helped me with the preparation of the English text, and to Prof. van Steenis for supervising the MS.

N2  - Among the unnamed material of Celastraceae received from the Paris Herbarium for determination, there was one flowering specimen of Microtropis, collected by M. Schmid from South Vietnam in 1953. It was difficult to name it to species with certainty. In order to clarify its identity, I received kind help from the Herbaria of Kew and Paris by sending me specimens on loan for comparison. After studying the specimens concerned, I have concluded that the collection of Schmid represents an undescribed species.In the course of studying the new species and annotating the material of Celastraceae received recently by the Rijksherbarium, Leiden, I examined also other specimens of extra-Malesian Microtropis. Together with the description of the new species, the results of the observation on those Microtropis species may follow here.

N2  - With astonishing diligence the thick third volume of this important work has been produced. Among the 79 families treated there are some large or very large ones, e.g. Anacardiaceae, Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Compositae, Cruciferae, and Cucurbitaceae. There is a general introduction for Dicotyledones, with a survey of phyletic affinities assumed by Takhtajan, Von Wettstein, and Hutchinson respectively, chemical characteristics of Dicots, alcaloid occurrence in Dicot. families, the occurrence of ‘pseudoindikanen’ and allied compounds, occurrence of salicyl compounds. After the family treatments, which are executed as in vol. 2, there is a fairly large amount of addenda to these families, and a large index.An analysis showed that of the 79 families treated the author says that 42 are distinctly insufficiently known phytochemically, and 17 are virtually unknown. As many of these two groups are very small, it would seem desirable that phytochemists decide to a joint effort to bring this up to date.

N2  - The present account of this genus follows the lines of that adopted for Flora Malesiana (ser. 11, 1, part 2, 1963). While studying Malesian species, I examined the types of those in neighbouring regions, to discover to what extent Malesian species were distributed further to the East and South-east. I found very few species with such extended distribution, but it was evident that the species of Australasia and the Pacific are closely related to those of Malesia. There has been no attempt at a full comparative survey of all the species of Cyathea over this vast area since Hooker and Baker’s Synopsis Filicum (2nd edition, 1874). Later accounts have been very summary, or confined to limited parts of the region, and there has been inconsistency as between dilferent accounts in the interpretation of some specific names, especially those originating with Forster. I have now examined type material of almost all species, and hope that I have resolved most of the discrepancies of interpretation. A few new species are also here described.Though the scales of the stipe provide characters by which any species may be placed in its subgenus, other characters are usually necessary for distinguishing individual species. Working from herbarium specimens, I find that the only way to distinguish clearly between species is to examine both indusia (if any) and scales on the lower surface of leaflets with a binocular dissecting microscope at a magnification of 25, and in the descriptions I have attempted to state concisely the distinctive characters of scales and indusia thus seen. The only previous authors who described scales at all carefully were Mettenius and Christensen. The indusia need even more careful examination than the scales. Some which have been described as cup-shaped are in fact hood-shaped, being open on the side towards the margin of the leaflet (e.g. C. cunninghamii); at the other extreme are indusia so small that they are covered by the ripe sporangia and so have sometimes been overlooked (e.g. in C. decurrens).

N2  - Among the Nyctaginaceae the genus Pisonia is the only one that has produced an appreciable number of species outside the New World. Some of these have very wide areas in the Pacific and along the borders of the Indian Ocean, others occupy smaller areas, mostly m eastern Malesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia. In Australia there are three species, in the north the circumtropical P. aculeata L., in the north and east P. umbellifera Seem, and P. grandis R. Br. In Africa there is only one circumtropical species in the eastern coastal parts, viz. P. aculeata L., further in the Malesian area two widely distributed Old World species, viz. P. umbellifera Seem, and P. grandis R. Br. occur.This revision contains a brief taxonomic discussion of the infrageneric subdivision. Calpidia, Ceodes, and Rockia are merged with Pisonia. In all 13 species are distinguished, for which keys, synonymy, and typification are provided. Of the five extra-Malesian species a description is given. Four new combinations have been made.I have to express my thanks to the Directors of the Herbaria at Florence, Paris, Singapore, Utrecht, and the Curator of Collections, Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, for the privilege of examining their collections. Besides, I have to thank Dr R. Melville of Kew and Dr H. Heine of Paris, for providing valuable information, to Mr M. Jacobs for considerable help and criticism, and to Dr van Steenis for supervising and editing this work.

N2  - Pycreus sect. Tuberculati was created by Chermezon to contain a single species with derived nutlets: P. divulsus, a Malagasy endemic. Kükenthal transferred this species to his new section Muricati. However, a detailed study of the nutlet epidermis shows P. divulsus is not closely related to the other species Kükenthal placed in the latter section. In addition P. divulsus subsp. africanus is upgraded to the species level based on its larger, smooth nutlets and African continental range.

In order to clarify the status and delimitation of the species concerned, the results of my investigations may follow here.Among the unnamed collections of Thailand Thymelaeaceae received for determination from the Kew Herbarium, two species of Aquilaria were found, a new one, A. subintegra Ding Hou, and a new record for the flora of that country, A. crassna Pierre ex H.

N2  - Sea-grasses are phanerogams which are completely adapted to life in marine waters. They are recruited exclusively from two families, the Potamogetonaceae (7 genera with ca. 35 species) and the Hydrocharitaceae (3 genera with 12 species), and form together an interesting ecological group. Consequently, their taxonomy, morphology, flower biology, and geographic distribution have been much studied, especially by Ascherson (1868, 1889, 1906, 1907), Sauvageau (1890, 1891), Ostenfeld (1915, 1916, 1927), Setchell (1920, 1935), and Miki (1932, 1934). In spite of the work of these eminent investigators the taxonomy of several genera viz. Halodule, Posidonia, Zostera, and Phyllospadix is yet imperfectly known. One of the most serious gaps in our knowledge is no doubt the lack of ecological data; this greatly hampers the judgment of the biometric characters of the species with relation to their usefulness for taxonomical purpose. Less important is the fact that the generative parts of several species are partly or completely unknown.The taxonomy of the genus Halodule, which had been known for a long time under the name Diplanthera has been studied in the scope of the revision of the Potamogetonaceae for the Flora Malesiana. The development of the taxonomy of this genus has been seriously obstructed not only by the difficulties in the interpretation of the slight morphological differences between the species but also by the fact that nearly all investigators based their identifications on the works of Ascherson (1889,1906,1907). According to this author the genus Halodule contains two species: H. uninervis (Forsk.) Aschers. and H. wrightii Aschers. Although he mentioned differences in generative and vegetative characters, the difference in geographic distribution he regarded as more important. Specimens from the Indo-Pacific were referred to as H. uninervis and those from the Caribbean were called H. wrightii. The geographic character was stressed in particular by Ostenfeld: “On the whole it is not possible to distinguish the two species when sterile, except using their quite different geographical distribution as criterion.” (1902, p. 262). “Die zwei Arten der Gattung sind einander so ähnlich, dass es nicht sicher ist, ob sie als zwei Arten beibehalten werden konnen. Ganz wie beim Artenpaare Halophila Baillonis – H. decipiens sind die Verbreitungsareale eigentlich das beste Unterscheidungsmerkmal.” (1927, p. 47). No wonder that the specimens in the herbaria all seem to be identified according to the traditional geographic scheme, even when the morphological characters of the plants de not agree with the species descriptions.

N2  - Among recent collections from the evergreen forests of Mysore State in southern India, material was found of Capparis cleghornii Dunn which had only been known from the original collection made by Cleghorn in 1846 and from a Stocks specimen from “Kanara”. Further scrutiny of fresh collections from the type locality established the identity. Mr M. Jacobs of the Rijksherbarium, Leyden, who is engaged in a study of die genus, informed us that little material was known and that he never had seen a fruit. The original description by Dunn is quite brief. A more detailed description is given below, based on living material which accounts for the larger sizes of the parts than are found in dried specimens. A considerable amount of collections have been made and a number of duplicates have recendy been distributed to the Herbaria at Kew, Leyden, Paris, Berlin, and Geneva.Capparis cleghornii Dunn, Kew Bull.

N2  - The differences between the most recent complete treatment of this genus by Clausen (1938) and the present revision are, I think, of a rather fundamental nature. For, though Dr Clausen and myself agree that in the troublesome taxa, ‘the small number of characters .... has forced workers .... to base conclusions concerning species often on trivial details such as leaf cutting and size, characters which would not ordinarily be considered of fundamental importance in other groups’ (l.c. p. 5), from there on we have followed a different train of thought. Clausen stated (l.c. p. 6) that ‘If these characters were not adopted as criteria for species, it would be necessary to reduce the species to a very small number and thereby remove the opportunity to keep apart populations which appear to be really distinct enough, but for which the characters available for species differentiation do not seem fundamental.’ This comes very close to Prantl’s critics (1884, 300) on Luerssen’s treatise where he stated: “.... so scheint die Frage, ob sie (i.e. the forms which Luerssen brought together under O. vulgatum) als Vatietäten oder als ebensoviele Arten zu bezeichnen sein, von untergeordneter Bedeutung zu sein Es gibt eine grosse Anzahl von Sammlern, Floristen etc., deren wissenschaftliches Bedürfnis befriedigt ist, wenn sie auf Etiquetten oder in Katalogen einen aus zwei Worten bestehenden Namen schreiben können; auf ‘Varietäten’ wird eine Rücksicht in der Regel nicht genommen.” In order to facilitate geographical studies based on these determinations Prantl then chose to accept a small species concept.

It appears to be closely related to Neuropeltis Wall, but differs by a number of important characters justifying its acceptance as the type of a new genus, Neuropeltopsis.Neuropeltopsis Ooststr., genus nov., a genere Neuropeltide differt inflorescentiis racemosis longioribus minus densis, bracteis magnis albis superne in parte inferiore florem unum gerentibus, marginibus glabris loborum corollae multo latioribus, filamentis paene totiis ad corollam adnatis, stylo uno longo in apice breviter bifurcato.

N2  - A study of the taxonomy and chorology of the Bulgarian species of Euphorbia has led me to consider their phytogeography; this entailed a closer view on the main features of florogenesis and distribution of subg. Esula in Europe. There are two problems concerned, viz. the origin of the two sections Tulocarpa (Raf.) Prokh. and Murtekias Prokh. which contain the most primitive and ancient species of the subg. Esula and furthermore a consideration of their mutual relationships and the main trends of their evolution within the subgenus.The data on the distribution of the species examined in the present paper have been taken from the works of Boissier (1862, 1879), Halacsy (1904), Fiori (1925), Hegi (1925), Hayek (1927), Eig (1932), Prokhanov (1933, 1949), Ade  Rechinger (1938), Rechinger (1938,1943, 1952, 1960), Czeczott (1939), Losa Espagna (1946), Diapoulis (1948), Prodan (1953), Vindt (1953), and Köie  Rechinger (1954/55).

N2  - The composition of the 2nd part of this work corresponds to that of the 1st, but, because it deals with only one class, the Monocotyledons, the whole could be more homogeneous. The Monocotyledons are systematically and anatomically less profoundly examined than the Conifers and the Dicotyledons, and for that reason it might be expected that phytochemistry could offer more often a solution in difficult taxonomical questions than in the above mentioned taxa. Unfortunately the phytochemical knowledge of the ca. 40 families of Monocotyledons has appeared to be so scant that it was impossible to base a comparison of the taxa on the chemical constituents. Only in a few cases there appeared to be clear chemical relations or differences, e.g. in the taxa of the Liliaceae – Amaryllidaceae complex.As in the first part of this book the author followed the view of Von Wettstein regarding the circumscription of the families, except for instances where chemistry favoured the splitting into smaller ones, as one can find so often in Hutchinson’s “Families of Flowering Plants”. For this reason Von Wettstein’s large families in the Helobiae have been accepted against the smaller concepts in this group by Hutchinson; reversely, Hutchinson has partly been followed in that the Liliaceae-Dracaenoideae together with the Amaryllidaceae-Agavoideae, occur combined as Agavaceae. Subfam. Amaryllidoideae (Allioideae excepted) has been considered as a separate family Amaryllidaceae, because of the occurrence of alkaloids in this group and the total absence of this constituent in the other taxa of the former Amaryllidaceae s.l.

N2  - This is a taxonomic revision of the genus Capparis in South and Southeast Asia, Malesia, Australia, and the Pacific. In this area, four sections are distinguished: 1. sect. Capparis, monotypic with C. spinosa, 2. sect. Sodada, monotypic with C. decidua, 3. sect. Monostichocalyx in a new circumscription containing most of the species formerly included in sect. Eucapparis, with about 65 species in the area under revision, 4. sect. Busbeckea, with 12—14 species in all.Of the 79 species recognized, 7 are new, viz. C. cataphyllosa, cinerea, koioides, monantha, pachyphylla, rigida, and rufidula, and 2 are elevated from varietal to specific rank, viz. C. annamensis (C. grandiflora var. annamensis Baker ƒ.) and C. pranensis (C. thorelii var. pranensis Pierre ex Gagn.). Of the 11 subspecies recognized under C. acutifolia, micracantha, and sikkimensis 9 are newly described or new in rank, like 3 out of the 8 varieties under C. loranthifolia, micracantha, and spinosa. Under C. brachybotrya, 2 formae have been maintained, under C. floribunda, is reduced. Three species, C. dielsiana with 2 varieties, C. longipes, and C. muelleriana, have been recorded as incompletely known besides.Chapters on characters and internal relationships, and plant-geographic remarks have been added. All type specimens are cited with the names based on them, the other collections only as far as they are important for the knowledge of the distribution. Notes dealing with deviating specimens, nomenclatural problems, related species in Africa, c. are given under the taxa.Starting from the idea that solitary large flowers and a beaked ovary with relatively many carpels, the presence of empty spiny bract-like cataphylls at the base of a shoot, and straight thorns are primitive characters, an attempt has been made to devise a subdivision of Sect. Monostichocalyx into 7 tentative Groups to show their natural interrelationships and possible derivation.It is regarded as most likely, that the genus, as represented in the area under revision, originated in southern India/Ceylon and/or Gondwanaland, and migrated into Australia, and later through the Indo-Chinese Peninsula to the northwest and northeast, and into Malesia.An index to numbered collections has been added. Hypselandra Pax  Hoffm. (syn. Meeboldia Pax  Hoffm.) is reduced to Maerua. B.S. Sun’s new taxa from China are discussed in an appendix.

N2  - On February 22nd, 1963, the Rijksherbarium suffered a severe loss by the passing away of its honorary officer, since 1945, Dr C. A. Backer, at the age of 88 years. His death came by no means unexpected. He had been ailing and largely bed-ridden for nearly two years; while his mental capacities remained unaffected almost up till the last day, his body suffered from an increasing weakness of the limbs, an increasing deafness and loss of eyesight. Not suffering from pain, he endured the weakening of his body with courage and resignation, token of his indomitable spirit.As two biographies, one provided with a full bibliography ¹), and an obituary note ²) are published elsewhere, the accent of the present obituary lies largely on the way in which his work became involved with that of the Rijksherbarium.

N2  - There is a great diversity of opinion regarding the interpretation of the genera and some species in the former Hippocrateaceae. If one reads the comprehensive and detailed revision of the New World Hippocrateaceae by A. C. Smith (Brittonia 3, 1940, 341—555), one may have an impression of it. For example, A. C. Smith in his monotypic genus Hemiangium, under H. excelsum, has united species which were recognized as belonging to three different genera by Miers; he has also limited Hippocratea L. to a single species, H. volubilis L., and placed more than 40 names of species and varieties in the synonymy of it.A detailed review of the history and generic delimitation of the family Hippocrateaceae has already ably been summarized and discussed by A. C. Smith in the above mentioned publication. I shall make only a brief account of those works which contain genera, species, or discussions related to the Malaysian flora.

N2  - Ridley (1883) based the genus Acriulus (Cyperaceae) on two species, A. madagascariensis Ridl. from Madagascar, and A. griegifolius Ridl. from Angola, the former of which must be considered the nomenclatural type, as the generic characters were chiefly taken from it, and the latter species was but inadequately known at the time. The author originally admitted a close affinity of Acriulus to Scleria, but “the different habit, the solitary spikeiets, and the deeply cleft style not continuous with the ovary” he regarded as sufficient to base a new genus upon, and, later on even as so important that he placed Acriulus in a different tribe, viz in Cryptangieae, not in Sclerieae (Ridley, 1884).Having had the opportunity to study a fairly great number of Acriulus specimens, I am now convinced that neither the so-called generic characters mentioned by Ridley nor any other feature justify their exclusion from Scleria. The distinct articulation between style and ovary occurring in several cyperaceous genera, such as Fimbristylis, Bulbostylis, Eleocharis, and Rhynchospora, undoubtedly furnishes a first-class character for generic delimitation. However, in Acriulus there is no question of the style being articulated with the ovary in this way, nor could I find any structural difference with the gynoecium in Scleria (fig. c and d). Deeply cleft styles are common in Scleria. There can hardly if at all be question of a habit peculiar to Scleria, a very large genus comprising annuals as well as perennials, both groups with numerous species of very diversified stature ranging from dwarfy to very stout. Therefore the alleged peculiar habit of Acriulus cannot be taken into account at the generic level. Besides, in Scleria poaeformis Retz., which may be the nearest ally of Acriulus, the numerous male spikelets are solitary, about evenly distributed along the branches of the panicle, and the few nut-bearing spikelets mostly restricted to the base of those branches, just like in Acriulus.

N2  - The flowering specimens of Glyptopetalum are very difficult to separate from those of Euonymus except by examining the number of ovules in each cell of the ovary. The ovules are mostly 2, rarely 3—12, per cell in Euonymus and there is only one in Glyptopetalum. However, the genus Glyptopetalum can be easily distinguished from Euonymus, or recognized, by the characteristic persistent columella of the fruit and the branched raphe of the seed (cf. also Fl. Mai. 1, 5, 1963, 256 and fig. 711).In preparing the Celastraceae for the Flora Malesiana, two additional extra-Malaysian species of Glyptopetalum have been found: a new one from Thailand and a new combination for the flora of China. The range of distribution of this genus is now extending to southwestern China.

N2  - At the request of Mr Airy Shaw the type specimen of Placolobium sumatranum Miq. Fl. Ind. Bat. 1, 1 (1855) 1082 has been examined from the Herbarium at Utrecht by kind permission of Prof. Lanjouw. It is very scrappy and consists of a loose rachis and leaflets and unfortunately the fruit valves described by Miquel are not present and could not be found among the carpologica by Miss Mennega.A close examination of the specimen has, however, shown that exactly similar specimens are found under Ormosia macrodisca Baker, showing the slightly sunken veins, areolae of similar size, epidermis with slightly granular surface and same colour, leaflets of same texture, and petiolules thickened, wrinkled transversely with shallow grooves. Moreover, the rachis also fits exactly that of O. macrodisca, is of the same size, lengthwise ribbed, and with the blackish trichomes at the nodes. From the description the fruit valves must also be similar to those of Ormosia macrodisca. Obviously Miquel had received leaves of a sterile twig and a loose fruit (without seed) picked from the ground. At that time the species was undescribed and he was unaware that such large woody fruits occurred in the genus. The species is rather widely distributed and several later collections have been made in Central Sumatra according to Mrs. Knaap in Reinwardtia 6 (1962) 230.

N2  - While studying the generic delimitation between the New Guinea Sericolea and the Subantarctic genus Aristotelia of the Elaeocarpaceae I got the impression from the descriptions that all but one species of Aristotelia described from Australia would belong to Aceratium. Also in Australia obviously doubts had arisen concerning their proper generic disposition. C. T. White (Kew Bull. 1932: 42) had already reduced his Aristotelia pubescens to Aceratium. Moreover, all Queensland “Aristotelias” I received from Brisbane had been relabelled“ Aceratium”. As unfortunately no material of these species is represented in the Leyden Herbarium, my study is mainly based on material from the Brisbane and Melbourne Herbaria. This study confirmed that only Aristotelia australasica F. v. M. from New South Wales had been described in the proper genus.In the present paper one new species and one new variety are described and one new combination is made in Aceratium, increasing the total of Australian species to five. As a fair amount of material has now become available, amplified descriptions are here presented of all species.

N2  - The present investigation arose from a discussion between Dr van Steenis and Mr C. T. White in July 1950 concerning a plant from North Queensland, collected by Mr L. J. Brass. The specimen was pre-identified as an Aristotelia but also showed similarity with the Papuan genus Sericolea. The need was felt to investigate the distinction between the two genera. Mr White was very keen to investigate the problem himself but this was unfortunately prevented by his untimely death, only two weeks after this discussion.The problem has rested ever since, until in 1963 I had to verify the distinction between the two genera for my work on the Pacific flora, a work executed under a grant from the Netherlands Organisation for the Advancement of Pure Research (Z.W.O.).

N2  - The amount of both living and herbarium material of Ericaceae, which has become accessible to the author in and from Malaysia since his various precursory papers on the family have been published, are the reason for this supplement.In Borneo, collecting in the last years has increased considerably in its northern part. In Sarawak, J. A. R. Anderson and E. F. W. Brunig collected a large number of Ericaceae on various mountains, partly not yet previously visited both within the ‘kerangas’ and the mossy forest. In N. Borneo it was Mrs Sheila Collenette who in 1960 climbed Mt Trus Madi, with c. 2620 m altitude the highest peak there next to Mt Kinabalu, and found on it a new species of Rhododendron besides other species, described from and thought to be limited to Mt Kinabalu up to now. Mt Kinabalu was visited again by W. Meijer in the lower part and the eastern shoulder above Kundasan, by Mrs Collenette in 1960 on a new path, the so-called Mesilau East route, and by the R. Society Expedition in 1961 under E. J. H. Corner (together with W. L. Chew and A. Stainton) on a new trail via the eastern shoulder towards the point, where it meets the Mesilau East route at c. 3440 m.

N2  - An account of phytochemical substance has been provided by Wiesner’s Rohstoffe des Pflanzenreichs, arranged by products, another account has been given by Karrer, compounds of established constitution arranged according to a chemical system. Though useful, none of these works, including also those of Czapek and Wehmer, aims, however, to use phytochemistry as an auxiliary branch of plant taxonomy.It does seem necessary here to stress in a concise way the importance of the subject for taxonomy. All of us have used some coarse phytochemical characters, looked at characteristic glands and crystals, observed and used colours of dried leaves, tasted plants for bitter substances, sniffed at aromatic oils, and other secondary compounds. The use of these characters as arguments for taxonomic purpose has, however, been erratic and only been employed if very obvious and/or abundant. Everyone of us looked for refinement of the aspect. This is the principal aim of the present endeavour.

Besides, as a corollary of plant-geographical studies on the Malaysian flora, my interest in it was distinctly restimulated by the compilation of maps of Pacific plants for the work ‘Pacific Plant Areas’.

N2  - A. F. G. Kerr (1877—1942) worked in Siam between 1902 and 1932, originally as a doctor, later as government botanist. He made large botanical collections in Siam and surveyed the whole of that country. Our knowledge of the flora of Siam is mainly based on his collections (now completely represented at Kew and in the British Museum), which formed the materials for the Florae Siamensis Enumeratio.A sketch of his life and career is given, also a bibliography, including special publications devoted to Kerr or to his material and details about his collections; by means of an Itinerary the date can be found of any Kerr number as well as the locality with approximate longitude and latitude, and by means of a list originally prepared by Kerr himself and here posthumously published, for each geographic name the province and the region of Siam where it is situated.Several persons were inspired by Kerr to make botanical collections themselves, notably Anuwat, Bourke-Borrowes, Mrs. Collins, Garrett, F. H. W. Kerr, Lakshnakara, Marcan, Noe, Put, Rabil, Rock, Eryl Smith, H. M. Smith, Vanpruk, Winit, Yuang. Some information about these persons and their collections has been added.

Dillon et Petit. — an etiam Richardi? — pro parte (c. S. foliosa Hochst. intermixta)” he based his S. dillonii, different from S. foliosa mainly by its globose or depressed-globose, smooth nuts.

This is not astonishing, as nearly all of his activities took place in Japan, a country outside our range of study.It took Dr. van Steenis some efforts to warm me up and in the meantime he gathered some information, mostly provided by Prof. Dr. H. Boschma at Leyden and by Prof. Dr. F. Verdoorn at Utrecht. When Verdoorn inter alia referred to Flora Malesiana vol. 1 (Cyclopaedia of Collectors) I was baffled and got intrigued, though at the time it seemed dubious whether “Burger”, who was cited there to have sent plants to Blume (1), was identical with Heinrich Bürger.

N2  - During the pre-naming of some new collections made by the Forestry Service of North Borneo, Mr L. L. Forman, Kew, provisionally identified a collection from Pulau Gaya, District of Jesselton, San 20499, gathered by Dr. W. Meijer, as an undescribed species of the American genus Simaba. As he knew that I had almost finished a revision of the Simaroubaceae for the Flora Malesiana, he immediately gave notice and sent the material with the permission of the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, without delay to Leyden. I have to thank him most cordially for this friendly and generous gesture. Later Dr. J. A. R. Anderson, of the Sarawak Forestry Service, Kuching, kindly pointed our attention to the fact that the species had been collected in the past, both in Borneo and Sumatra, and that these specimens had been distributed as Parishia sp.In critical checking the generic identity of the specimen, Mr Forman’s opinion appeared to be correct, and the new plant has been since described as a new species in the Flora Malesiana. At the same time it appeared possible to accommodate it also in several other American and African genera as well, for example Simarouba, Hannoa, and Odyendyea. This necessitated a closer comparison of these genera, and some others, a desirability which I had earlier thought to lie outside the scope of the Flora Malesiana revision.

N2  - Becker (1917, 1925) considered Viola hederacea Labill., within which he placed V. sieberiana Spreng. (as V. hederacea var. Sieberi Hook, f.), to be the only member of Section Erpetion (Sweet) Becker and to belong to the ‘Antarctic Floristic Element’. V. hederacea occurs widely in temperate southern and eastern Australia (Fig. 1) where it is somewhat variable, particularly in leaf shape, and may grade rather confusedly into V. sieberiana, as on Kangaroo Island, S. Australia.Whilst examining a collection of violets on loan from the herbarium of the Papua and New Guinea Department of Forests, Lae, a specimen from Malaya was readily identified as V. hederacea: — MALAYA: Pahang Cameron Highlands, summit of Batu Brinchang, ‘exposed escarpment; stoloniferous herb in thin grassy sward; flowers white with purple centre’, 2031 m., 1. ix. 1956, H. M. Burkill 805 (LAE). The collection is identical with the most typical form in Australia, having the rosettes of leaves and flowers at intervals along the stolons, reniform leaves 1.4—2.0 times as long as broad with cordate base and showing the ‘hederaceous’ outline; the lateral petals are markedly bearded and the filiform style has a geniculate base and a simple stigma.

N2  - This study is a full-sounding prelude to the fundamental work on the morphology of inflorescences, which is being prepared by Prof. Dr. W. Troll of Mainz.All inflorescences in Valerianaceae are understood as modifications of one basic form, the thyrse. It is gratifying to note that forms of inflorescences, described in systematical works as for instance 1) capitate or interruptedly spicate (Plectritis), 2) compound dichasium, dichotomous throughout (cymoid Valeriana spp.), or dichotomously branched inflorescence (Valerianella), 3) ‘rispig bis fast trugdoldig’ (Phuodendron), in reality all are variations on one theme, the decussate mono-, to pleiothyrse, i. e. a simple to compound inflorescence with a racemous primary axis and cymous lateral axes. The transformations take place first of all by a favoured development of lateral axes on definite heights of the main axis (‘basi-mesotoner, akrotoner Förderungssinn’) and secondly by the number of flowers developing and the more or less pronounced tendency to form monochasia. Moreover, different forms such as loose panicles, umbels, glomerules, heads and even nearly simple racemes (Aretiastrum), originate by extension or reduction of axes of some or all orders.

N2  - Within the genus Vaccinium L. this revision of its Malaysian species — which comprises more than half of the total number of species of the genus — is the last in a series of modern treatments made for North America by W. H. Camp, for the Pacific area by C. Skottsberg, and for tropical America and tropical Asia by the present author. The work formerly done in Malaysian Vaccinium has been limited to islands, as that by J. J. Smith and Schlechter for a part of New Guinea, by Copeland f. for the Philippines, and by Amshoff for Java, with the shortcomings necessarily connected with such too local work.The sections proposed for the Malaysian species in my general system in 1941 have been found still useful and are kept here except a nomenclatural change in one section and the expansion in species due to the large amount of indetermined material collected in Celebes and especially in New Guinea.

N2  - Mr F. H. Hildebrand, who is going gradually through the tree species from New Guinea, pointed my attention to this species, the type of which is in the Rijksherbarium at Leyden (in fruiting state). It was collected by Zippelius who rightly recognized its alliance; he added a MS description and gave it the MS name Epicharis lasiocarpa. Miquel subsequently described it in the genus Dysoxylum, but the curved fern-like leaftip and other characters leave no doubt about its belonging to Chisocheton.There are at Leyden two further collections of it from New Guinea, both made by Teysmann, HB 6058 and 6060.

N2  - After Boeckeler's treatise on the species of Scleria known in his day (5), no comprehensive study on the genus has ever been published. The preparation of an up-to-date monograph would be an arduous task, not only owing to the large size of the genus, but also to the numerous problems encountered in its delimitation and its subdivision. Fortunately several very valuable studies on the Scleriae of America and Africa have been published lately, which are important precursors to a future monographic treatment. Core (14) revised the American species, Chermezon (8, 9) those of Madagascar, Piérart (24) published a study on the species of Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi, and Nelmes (22, 23) gave an account of the genus for the whole of Africa.The history of Scleria has been given by Core and need therefore not be repeated here. I may, however, venture some general remarks on the morphology of the inflorescence, as my views differ in several respects from the current ones. In this connection also the circumscription and subdivision of the genus will be discussed.

N2  - Derris solorioides is described as a new species and illustrated. This species is only the second calciphilous and true-paniculate species of Derris ever recorded. The species was found in isolated and protected limestone areas surrounded by agricultural areas in Nakhon Sawan province, North-Central Thailand. It is characterized by its rather smaller flowers but with more ovules than other species of Derris, and 1-winged pods showing a dark-coloured pericarp around the seeds without thickening of the pericarp. The characters of the pods are similar to those found in Solori, a genus once synonymized with Derris and, therefore, the epithet ‘solorioides’ was assigned. This species appeared to be a distinct taxon in the molecular phylogeny, separate from its morphologically highly similar species, D. marginata. It is also a member of a lineage of Derris consisting of species with a deviating type of inflorescence: intermediate forms and true panicles, which is quite uncommon in this genus. The relationship with its closely related species is discussed, and a key to the species of Derris in the ‘deviating type of inflorescence’ clade is presented.

N2  - Southern African Oxalis taxonomy is complicated by tremendous morphological variation. The widely distributed Oxalis flava, for example, currently contains eight morphologically distinct forms. The remaining members of sect. Crassulae display morphological characters distinctive enough to retain specific status, despite resemblance to forms of the broadly defined O. flava. Recent collection of a taxon with strong morphological affinities to species in sect. Crassulae generated much interest. In this study we assess the placement of this new taxon to members of sect. Crassulae based on analyses of DNA sequence data of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region and morphological comparisons. Results show that most members of sect. Crassulae are distantly related to O. flava.However, our morphological and molecular data strongly suggested that the newly collected taxon represents yet another form of O. flava. In addition, these data show O. fabaefolia to be nested within O. flava, suggesting that it should be synonymised under this broadly defined species. Both the new taxon and O. fabaefolia display unique morphological characters, allowing them to be considered separate subspecific taxa of O. flava. Thus the taxa O. flava var. fabaefolia and O. flava var. unifoliolata are here proposed.

N2  - Spiranthes sinensis (Pers.) Ames, also known under the synonym S. australis (R. Br.) Lindl., is a terrestrial orchid widely spread in Asia, which is rather well known in Western Europe, because it has repeatedly been found growing spontaneously in pots in orchidhouses.In Blumea 6(2): 361 (1950) the plant described as Ophrys lancea Thunb. ex Sw. was considered to be identical with the first and it was thought that the recombination Spiranthes lancea (Thunb. ex Sw.) B. B. S. was necessary. The reasons given for this transfer were: (1) the short diagnosis of Ophrys lancea given by Winberg in Florula Javanica, p. 8 (1825); (2) the original diagnosis of O. lancea in Swartz’s well-known dissertation on the classification of orchids in Kongl. Vet. Akad. Handl. Stockh. 21: 223 (1800); (3) the presence of the apparent holotype in the Thunberg herbarium (Uppsala).

N2  - The publication of the supplement 1 of the well known and essential reference work of “A Bibliography of Eastern Asiatic Botany” is very welcome. It is a continuation of the original work, which closed with 1936, and extends through 1958. It covers the botanical literature on eastern Asia, as indicated by the title, which comprises China, Japan, Korea, Ryukyu, Mongolia and Soviet eastern Asia, as well as the major published papers appertaining to adjacent areas. It has been prepared on essentially the same pattern as the original volume while the subject index has been treated perhaps in a more thorough manner.The volume contains over 11,000 extensively and carefully annotated entries occupying 414 pages. The work is in English but the titles, papers and author names in oriental characters are fully cited, which is an improvement as compared with the original volume. It includes now the original Chinese, Japanese and Korean titles and author names as published in oriental characters as well as translations or transliterations of them. In addition, the supplement fortunately covers the extensive Russian literature, nearly 1600 entries, on Soviet eastern Asia. All Russian titles are transliterated into Roman letters and are also translated. All these improvements make this bibliography more complete than the original volume and extend its usefulness.

N2  - As a phylogenist, I have often experienced that a relatively small number of scientifically working botanists realize the importance — or even the existence — of the factor time. It is true that many of them never come across that factor; for a man who through his microscope analyses the structure of a tissue, or a man who with the most delicate methods investigates the composition of organic compounds in a vacuole, the factor time is quite insignificant, as long as they keep analysing and do not ask where things come from (which they usually don’t).However, the changes which time may entail in the material investigated, are practically always interpretable in terms of reversibility or periodicity. They seldom or never evoke thoughts of a farther past than a few hours, days, or years. I have sometimes felt astonished, moreover, that even morphologists who study the ontogeny of organs to the minutest details consciously or unconsciously stop at what they cannot observe with their senses, directly or by the mediation of their instruments; the step from ontogenist to phylogenist seems to be a very wide one.

N2  - Descriptions are given of the tribe Lepidagathideae, that had already been proposed in an earlier paper, and of an entirely new tribe related to the latter, the Borneacantheae. The last-named tribe comprises so far but a single genus, Borneacanthus, based on B. grandifolius; it further includes B. angustifolius, B. paniculatus, B. stenothyrsus, B. parvus and B. mesargyreus (Hall. f.) Brem. (Strobilanthes mesargyreus Hall. f. = Filetia mesargyrea Brem.), and is confined to Borneo. Another new genus, Cosmianthemum, a near ally of Pseuderanthemum, seems to have an even narrower geographical distribution, for it has been found so far only in the western part of Borneo. It is based on C. magnifolium, and comprises in addition C. latifolium, C. angustifolium, C. obtusifolium, C. longibracteatum, C. brookeae, C. punctulatum and C. subglabrum. To the species of these two genera keys are provided. Further are described Hemigraphis sarawacensis, Lepidagathis marginata, Filetia brookeae, F. lanceolata, Hallieracantha peranthera and Peristrophe monosemaeophora. The area of Hallieracantha is extended to Siam by the inclusion of H. graphocaula (Imlay) Brem. ( Justicia graphocaula Imlay). On account of the presence of two different kinds of pollen in this genus, it is suggested that it may not be an altogether natural unit. The leaves of the two new species of Filetia proved to contain inulin, but this substance, whose occurrence in the Acanthaceae was so far unknown, is not present in all the representatives of this genus.

N2  - My first acquaintance with the genus Blumea was made in December of 1949. On one of my taxonomy field trips then, and many more subsequently, I encountered these weedy, yellow-flowered composites. Perhaps what most helped to attract my attention was their relative abundance and their characteristic pungent odour that was hard to miss. My attempts to identify these plants brought me down quite consistently to the genus Blumea; in most cases, I could proceed no farther than that with any degree of certainty. The specimens would either be quite close to species “x” or belong in the same general group as species “y”. On making inquiries then, I learned that the genus was extremely variable, not at all “wellbehaved”, and troublesome to key. My interest in these plants soon followed.This interest did not transpose itself into any serious work on the group until December of 1955. Meanwhile, bibliographic research had more and more convinced me of the need for a taxonomic revision of the group. As early as 1882, Hooker had recognised the inadequacy of the characters theretofore used and even those used by him to separate the species. His remarks following the generic diagnosis in the Flora of British India (Vol. 3: 260) will only serve to emphasize this point: “There is no more unsatisfactory genus than this; it is distinguished from Laggera only by the tailed anthercells, and this is not a very constant character, the anthers of some states of B. virens having no tails whilst forms of Laggera have them; Kurz, indeed, suggests (with much probability) that some Laggeras are sexual forms of Blumeas. The divisions of the genus here proposed are most unsatisfactory, and I fear that the specific diagnoses are not much better. The glabrous or pubescent receptacle is very difficult to see; the size of the heads is tolerably constant; the form and number of the involucral bracts are difficult to describe; the very minute achenes are tolerably uniform; the foliage is sportive to an extraordinary degree, as is the pubescence; gland hairs are common to most species, but the amount varies with the dryness of the locality. I have not been able to follow Clarke’s disposition of the species at all closely, but they want a careful study in situ and under cultivation”.

N2  - In 1902 Gresshoff edited, for the “Koloniaal Museum” at Haarlem, a folio memorial volume, “Rumphius Gedenkboek”, dedicated to the memory of that great pioneer in the East Malaysian tropics, Rumphius, at the occasion of the bicentenary of his death in Ambon, the Moluccas, where he lived from 1654 till his death in 1702. Notwithstanding many mishappenings he attained the ripe age of 75 years, a most unusual career for a pioneer in the tropics, and carried on, as a disinterested hobby, nay as a vocation, his studies of plants and animals. His observations, laid down in voluminous MSS, none of which was published during his life-time, are, besides being written in a most lively style, so accurate, that they still form a source of knowledge today.The 1902 Memorial Volume was partly in Dutch, partly in German, and is still a standard work, but it was not exhaustive. There were chapters devoted to an evaluation of the evertebrate animals described in Rumphius’s “Rariteitkamer”, but not of the other animals and there was no evaluation of the Herbarium Amboinense; in his attempt to re-collect Rumphian plants and make this account Boerlage even lost his life (1900).

N2  - Among the extensive collections of algae made by Dr P. Wagenaar Hummelinck (Utrecht) in the Antilles and adjacent regions during the years 1930, 1936, 1937, 1948—1949, 1955, a number of chiefly brackish, but also freshwater, Cyanophyceae were incorporated. This collection was kindly committed for study to the author. She is indebted to Dr F. Drouet, who identified part of it. Most of the localities have been amply described by the collector (1940, 1953), who also included pictures of several localities in the same papers.The map illustrating this paper was drawn by the collector. He also was so kind as to complete the descriptions of the localities in the present paper.

N2  - Bazziana is a richly developed genus of Hepaticae, as compared to other hepatics represented by large and conspicuous plants of a creeping habit, with ineubous leaves and dichotomously branched shoots, which adhere to the substratum by many flagelliform branches, which are provided with reduced leaves and arise from the axils of underleaves.After the author had collected material of some 20 species in West Java, he attempted to get some knowledge of the whole genus as it occurs in Java, and of the differences from the Bazzania flora of other islands in the Malaysian region. This study is presented here as a preliminary one, and as a forerunner to a fuller treatment of the genus for the whole Malaysian region. Some species are still only known from scanty type collections and their status is rather uncertain. A detailed study of the sexual branches, the perianths and involucra is not attempted here, because the available material is still very incomplete in this respect.

N2  - (1) The accompanying map illustrates the hierarchy of the floristic subdivision of the Malaysian-Pacific area and its demarcation against the New World flora. The way of linking it with the mainland of Eastern Asia has not been worked out. Further it has not been attempted to subdivide the Australian flora including Tasmania.The following names are proposed: (2) As has appeared from the surveys the number of endemic genera pro subdivision cannot be placed in any proportion to the surface of that subdivision; this appears for example from the following figures: (3) If two islands are comparable ecologically (latitude, altitude, climate, soils) and are at comparable distance from a continental flora or other big plant source, the island with the smallest surface has the largest percentage of world-wide genera (type 1). This appears from a comparison of Samoa (43%) with Tonga (50%), and Tonga with Cook I. (61.6%). (4) The highest percentage of worldwides is found in the coral islets and atolls. (5) For ecologically more or less comparable islands the rule seems to be that the distance to a continental flora or other rich plant source and the total number of genera are inversely proportional. For example Lord Howe I. (surface 13 sq.km) at a distance of 500 km from Australia has 126 genera and Norfolk I. (surface 40 sq.km) at a distance of 1600 km from Australia has only 103 genera, even though it is thrice as large as Lord Howe I. (6) Generic endemism and specific endemism often do not go parallel. The Galápagos, Marquesas, New Hebrides, and Rapa I. have a high specific endemism, but possess very few endemic genera. (7) a. In the Pacific the Malaysian influence reaches in general wide and far. b. The Australian influence in the Pacific is proportionally small and affects mostly the southern Pacific. c. The influence of the American flora is surprisingly small, even in islands which are situated relatively very close to the. New World if compared with their distance to the Old World, for example the Marquesas, Easter I., etc. d. If the South American element is found far in the Pacific it is almost restricted to the subantarctic part of it. (8) The method of the demarcation knots is only useful if islands or island groups are contrasted which have a comparably rich flora, containing a number of genera of about the same order, for example Formosa and the Philippines, Malaysia and Australia, the Solomons and the New Hebrides (the latter with respectively 431 and 371 genera: demarcation 60 %).If the areas are very dissimilar in number of genera the method of demarcation knots will result in a wrong picture of the situation.In the latter case the approach for the estimate should be made in another way, for example by focussing attention to the number of genera which occur in the poorest of the pair and not in the richest.An illustrative example of this is a comparison between New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, where the demarcation knot would be 61 % on account of the very high number of New Caledonian genera which do not occur in the Loyalties. Actually, only 2 genera occur in the Loyalties which have not been recorded from New Caledonia, showing that the Loyalty Islands flora is merely a depauperated New Caledonian one.

N2  - Gnetum neglectum war nicht nur, wie der Name andeutet, bis zu Blumes Zeit übersehen worden, sondern es wurde von Späteren wiederum verkannt, wie ich in Bull. J. B. Buitenzorg 3. Ser. 10 (1930) 474 näher ausgeführt habe. Die echte Art taucht verhältnismässig selten in den Herbarien auf. Sie ist eine Pflanze der Alluvialwälder in Borneo. Vegetativ ist sie ausgezeichnet durch derbe, grosse, lanzettlich-elliptische Blätter mit Träufelspitze, deren Seitennerven auffallend weit voneinander abstehen. Die Blütenstandsachsen sind ziemlich zart und wenig verzweigt, die Samen klein, ungestielt und etwas gelblich.Merkwürdigerweise war in den reichen Sammlungen aus Borneo, die mir bisher zu Gesicht kamen, diese Art immer nur durch ♀ Pflanzen vertreten. Jetzt sind zum ersten Mal auch ♂ Exemplare zum Vorschein gekommen, und zwar im Herbarium Sarawak. Sie sind repräsentiert durch eine neuere Sammlung des Porest Department Herbarium Brunei, Smythies, Wood  Ashton, Flora of Brunei, Nr. S. 5752, gesammelt om 25. 3. 1957 am Ufer des Flusses Belalong im Primärwald in 250 Fuss Meereshöhe, und durch eine ältere Sammlung aus Kuching, Nr. 202 des Sarawak Museums. Durch die oben angegebenen Merkmale der Blätter und des Aufbaus der Blütenstände erwiesen sich die Exemplare deutlich als zu dieser Art gehorig, und die männlichen Kätzchen haben durchaus einen eigenen Charakter, der von anderen Arten abweicht.

N2  - Abrus is a small natural genus of the family Papilionaceae, containing four species, well distinguished by the presence of 9 connate stamens. As a genus it was first described by Adanson in 1763 who based it on Glycine abrus L.. In fruit this species is easily distinguished by its conspicuously red and black coloured seeds, which are used in various ways, e.g. as beads in rosaries and necklaces, for making poison and medicine.The flowers of the species in Abrus do not show any character leading to specific segregation. Characters of the pod and inflorescence are more useful. One, imperfectly known, species is recorded only from Madagascar and another is confined to tropical Africa. The other two species have a circumtropical distribution, one of these, A. fruticulosus, is widely variable in habit, in the shape of the leaves, and in the indumentum. It is not advisable to segregate the different forms of this species, which were formerly described as distinct species (such as A. schimperi, A. mollis, A. cantoniensis, etc.), as infraspecific taxa, e.g. as varieties, or as name-bearing forms.

N2  - The species of the Atlantic Rhizophora have formerly been considered as belonging to one species, R. mangle L. In 1818 G. F. W. Meyer (11) described a second species, R. racemosa, from British Guiana. On working up the Rhizophoras of British Guiana Leechman (10) added a third species, R. harrisonii in 1908, and distinguished all these three species. Through the works of Salvoza (13), Savory (14), Keay (9), Stearn (15), and Jonker (8), it has become clear that these three species occur on the West African and East American shores as well as in some Caribbean islands.In the Old World, from the coast of East Africa to Malaysia, there are also three (other) distinct species as distinguished by many authors and by myself (7).

N2  - The enumeration of about 760 species and 140 varieties and forms of marine algae growing along the eastern coasts of the tropical and subtropical parts of America, and belonging to the Phacophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Xanthophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and Rhodophyceae, is preceded by an historical review of collecting and knowledge of those algae. One new family, Wurdemanniaceae, eight new species of the genera Caulerpa, Dictyota, Dictyopteris, Padina (by Thivy), Cryptonemia and Ceramium, and four new varieties belonging to the genera Dictyota, Galaxaura, Rhodymenia, and Herposiphonia, have been described. Several formae are only marked as such, but not given a name. A number of new combinations are found all through the systematical part of the book. Though this book contains a great quantity of information about the marine algae from the coasts of Bermuda and North Carolina up to that of southern Brazil, the author does not claim monographic completeness. Doubtful records remain for further investigation.A short chapter on geographical distribution is included, as well as an extensive one on the habitats of the algae, illustrated by 14 photographs from Bermuda and Jamaica. The last mentioned chapter contains an elaborate description of the algal vegetation in all its variations in the territory dealt with. Moreover, it gives many practical indications for effective ecological studies. At the end an explanation of the “Sargasso Sea” is found.

N2  - The scope of the present paper is primarily to give a taxonomical revision of the genus Canarium. Furthermore, attention has been paid to some subjects of a more general nature, mainly regarding morphology and geography, without, however, claiming completeness.The last complete revision of the genus was published by Engler in 1883 (in DC. Mon. Phan. 4, 101—151). Of course this is now for the greater part out of date. The later revisions by the same author in E.  P., Nat. Pfl. Fam. ed. 1, 34, 1896, 238—242, and ed. 2, 19a, 1931, 443—450, are not really monographs; moreover, they lost in value by the introduction of a subdivision which was mainly based upon unessential characters.

N2  - Since the publication of the Revision of the Genus Dillenia (Blumea 7, 1952, pp. 1—145) a number of additional collections have come to my notice. As is to be expected, the most interesting ones are from Eastern Malaysia, where the genus has developed a high degree of diversity and where the number of collections is still relatively small.

As the original description is insufficient for a good understanding of what its author had in hands, a redescription of the type specimen would not seem out of place.For the supply of some material for comparison my thanks are due to Dr R.

N2  - The well-known Ray Society undertook the publication of this new facsimile of Linnaeus’s most famous and still indispensable botanical work and had it reproduced photographically from an original copy in Linnaeus’s library, later owned by Sir James Edward Smith. It represents the third facsimile edition of the work and, in spite of the earlier Berlin (1907) and Tokyo (1934) editions, which are no longer obtainable, it will certainly fill a real need, were it only to save copies of the rare and expensive original from wear and tear.Although much has been written about Linnaeus and his numerous publications, the delightful frame provided by W. T. Stearn and J. L. Heller makes the new edition all the more valuable and useful, not only since the supplementary chapters enliven the book as a cultural product of its period but because the introduction and much of the appendix have been very ably written by a working taxonomist primarily concerned with Linnaeus’s works for their relevance to modern botanical nomenclature, who has thoroughly studied history, method and bibliography and also, to some extent, the life and psychology of the author and the scientific attitudes of the period. Stearn has also aimed at avoidance of the misunderstanding and confusion, which follow from treating 18th century publications as if they were 20th century productions. Emphasis is laid on what may well be the most important conclusion for Linnaean typification in the whole work (cf. p. 97), viz. that within every main entry in Species Plantarum there is, or was at some stage of its development, an illustration or a specimen seen by Linnaeus and not simply a description by a pre-Linnaean author, the exceptions being definitions or descriptions by Van Boyen, Gronovius, or Boissier de Sauvages, his disciples, so to speak, in the Linnaean method, whose work was therefore acceptable.

N2  - According to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Art. 23, the nomenclature of the Uredinales, Ustilaginales and Gasteromycetes begins with Persoon’s “Synopsis Methodica Fungorum”, published in 1801. His descriptions, however, are partly not very explicit and as, according to the Code, Art. 69, rust names are valid solely in so far as they refer to “spores giving rise to basidia”, i.e. the teleuto-stage, the present author found it desirable to examine Persoon’s collection of rusts preserved in the Rijksherbarium, Leiden. Through the courtesy of Dr. R. A. Maas Geesteranus, Mycologist of the Rijksherbarium, all specimens of the genera Aecidium, Uredo and Puccinia were lent to the Botanical Museum of the University of Oslo, where the author got the opportunity of examining them. The collection contained 792 numbers, comprising 221 species of rusts, 19 species of smuts, and 14 species of other fungus groups. A complete list of determinations is filed in the Rijksherbarium. The main aim was to find suitable lectotypes for Persoon’s taxa of 1801, among specimens containing teleuto. And owing to the type method now being established (Code, Art. 18) it seems natural to consider a Uredo name valid if the type contains teleuto, even if this stage has not been mentioned in the author’s description of the species in question (cp. D. P. Rogers, Mycologia, 45 pp. 250—251, 1948, and D. B. O. Savile, Canadian Journ. Bot., 3 p. 490, 1955). This view makes Persoon’s names Uredo betae and U. viciae-fabae valid.However, most of the specimens had clearly been collected after 1801 and were consequently unsuitable as material for lectotypes. This younger material contains many species that are not mentioned in Syn. Meth. Fung. and consequently not treated in the present publication. For the taxa established by Persoon in 1801 have particularly been taken into consideration those specimens that in Persoon’s handwriting are solely furnished with the same name (or sometimes with a somewhat differing one) as in Syn. Meth. Fung. and without author name, or sometimes with Persoon’s own. Most of the other specimens of the same taxa are also labeled solely or partially by Persoon, but have not been taken into consideration as material for lectotypes because the names do not correspond with those in Syn. Meth. Fung., or are obviously younger than 1801 (e. g. if published by De Candolle, Link, or other contemporary authors). Many of these specimens Persoon had received from other botanists, particularly Chaillet, Balbis, and Mougeot. Only one specimen presumably older than 1801 is mentioned as having been received from another person, viz. Smith (presumably J. E. Smith in England); it is labeled Uredo linearis β. Polypodii and contains Hyalopsora polypodii (Diet.) Magn.

N2  - Payena as a genus was created by Alphonse De Candolle in his Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis in 1844. He commemorated in it the French chemist A. Payen (1795—1871) in Paris. De Candolle placed in it the species Mimusops lucida, first described by G. Don; the latter employed this nomen nudum used by Wallich in his List of specimens in the East India Company’s Museum (1858). The famous Swiss botanist characterized the new genus by the following diagnosis on page 196: “Calyx 4-partitus (nec 8-partitus, ut dixit cl. G. Don), lobis ovatis, obtusis extus et margine puberulis, 2 exterioribus latioribus. Corolla 8-fida, basi tubulosa, superne campanulata, calyce vix longior; lobis 2 ante lobum quemque calycis, ovato-acutis, glabris. Stamina 8, tubo corollae prope faucem inserta, lobis opposita, denticulis interjectis. Filamenta brevissima. Antherae lanceolatae, angulosae, inclusae, filamento multo longiores, connectivo in acumen obtusiusculum carnosum producto, loculis subextrorsis, longitudinaliter dehiscentibus. Ovarium hirsutum, 8-loculare. Stylus rectus, glaber, calyee duplo longior, apice obscure dentatus. Ovula 8, ovoideo-angulosa, acuta, deinde ovoidea, ex angula superiore cujusve loculi pendentia. Fructus ign. — Frutex? aut arbuscula? foliis ellipticis, basi subacutis, apice obtuse acuminatis, glaberrimis, superne nitidis, subtus pallidioribus; pedicellis 1—3 ex axillis foliorum superiorum, petiolo duplo longioribus, erectis, pilis minimis adpressis subpubescentibus. —” He placed it between Isonandra and Bassia and “perhaps near Azaola” (“forsanque Azaolae proximum”). Today Isonandra is to be considered a genus in the neighbourhood of Palaquium (a group with the parts of calyx and corolla isomerous), and Bassia and Azaola are considered synonymous to Madhuca. De Candolle, while correcting the evident mistake of Don concerning the number of parts of the calyx, makes himself another by saying “Stamina 8...” (see under P. lucida).

N2  - For many years the monotypical genus Aesandra was incorporated in Payena (vide Lam 1925, 1927) or Madhuca (Bassia sensu Lecomte, 1930). Revising the genus Payena we came across specimens, that did not fit in the diagnosis of either genus; it appeared that the specimens in question showed a mixture of the characters of both Payena and Madhuca, and also some characters of their own. These we found to belong to what has been described as Aesandra. The only species is A. dongnaiensis Pierre, 1890. It is our impression that Aesandra is to be maintained as a separate genus of the Madhuceae (cf. Lam, Rec. Trav. Bot. Neerl. 36, 1939, 525).We examined material from the following herbaria: British Museum (Natural History) at London (BM), Rijksherbarium at Leiden (L) and Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Phanérogamie, at Paris (P) and are very much obliged to the authorities of these institutes for the loan of specimens and the hospitality enjoyed during our stay in 1955 at Paris and London.

N2  - For identifying the mosses collected in different localities of the Malaysian region, the need was felt for a key to the genera. In the preliminary one that I constructed to this end the genera were taken in the delimitation accepted in the second edition of Brotherus, Natürl. Pflanzf. In addition to the latter the genera published after 1925 and therefore not included in Brotherus 1. c. are taken into account. In revising the families for Flora Malesiana I will doubtless be compelled to alter the position of some of the species and the delimitation of some of the genera, and at the end of series III of Flora Malesiana, which will contain the Mosses, I therefore intend to give a final key. I sincerely hope that the preliminary key will in the meantime have been tested by different bryologists, and that they will let me profit by their remarks. For this reason it is published here.The analytical key is based as far as possible on vegetative characters, especially on the shape of the leaf cells. The principal features of the sporophyte are noted, but are not, as a rule, made use of as alternatives. This applies particularly to those alternatives that lead to the main groups. Only when no reliable vegetative characters could be found, have characters of the sporophyte, especially those of the peristome, been used. The habitat of each genus, not its distribution in the Malaysian region, is indicated in the key.

N2  - The Netherlands’ coast being sandy and muddy is not suitable for most algal growth. Dikes, piers and harbour-works replace the rocks elsewhere. The pier at Hoek van Holland is one of these artificial rocky coasts. It has been constructed with basalt blocks and other hard stones, viz. the so called “Nilvoordste steen” and “Doornikse steen”, both from Belgium.The pier projects into the sea about 1350 m. On the southern side it is washed by the mouth of the Nieuwe Waterweg, on the northern side by the North Sea. A little more (fig. 1) up the Nieuwe Waterweg there are several basins enclosed by a dam parallel to the pier and a number of dams at right angles to it, thus replacing the rockpools of natural rocky shores.

N2  - On studying newly received material of Haplolobus, mostly from New Guinea, the key in Husson  Lam 1953 ¹) proved to be far from satisfactory in several respects. This is why all material now available has been given a critical consideration or reconsideration, as the case may be, and from this originated a new revision with a new key, which is presented here.Since the flowers of the various Haplolobus species are of the same type and very uniform, and since they are wanting in so many specimens either in one of the sexes or in both, it appeared, for the time being at least, unfeasible to use them for differential characteristics in the key. The same holds true for the fruits. Only when abundant flowering and fruiting material will be available is there a chance (but no certainty) that good differential characters will be detected in flowers and (or) fruits.

N2  - This study includes the whole genus Planchonella, contrary to some other publications in this series, which refer only to species found in the area covered by the Flora Malesiana. This seemed desirable both on account of the fact that only a small number of species is found outside that area, and of the doubted generic status of Planchonella versus Pouteria sensu Baehni.Our conclusion is that Pouteria and Planchonella represent two separate genera. Pouteria has its main centre of development in South America, Planchonella in New Guinea, Australia and New Caledonia. The last-named arc has thus so far rather been underestimated as a centre of speciation in Planchonella.

N2  - The only record of Thesium in Malaysia was hitherto the Southern Chinese Thesium psilotoides Hance from medium altitudes of the Benguet and Bontoe Mountain Provinces in North Luzon, according to Merrill (Enum. Philip. Fl. Pl. 2, 1923, 115), occurring between 1200 and 1500 m. The same species has also been found in the Lesser Sunda Islands, Sumba Island, by C. N. A. de Voogd (E. Sumba, 300 m, limestone quarry, De Voogd 1873 (80, L), Dec. 1, 1934, plant pale green, fruit yellow, flower white).The Sumba specimens exactly match the Philippine specimens. Species like this one, with a very short calyx tube, look astonishingly like Halorrhagis, in habit, but possess 5-merous flowers, lack bulbous-based hairs, and show a peculiarly cartilaginous leaf apex.

N2  - During the year 1948, Mr. W. H. Schuster, Laboratory of Inland Fisheries, Buitenzorg (Bogor), sent samples for determination from coastal saltwater-ponds kept for raising Chanos chanos (bandeng). Cyanophyceae have proved to form an important ingredient of the diet of the bandeng-fry.The cooperation in studying the thick layer of Cyanophyceae on the bottom of the ponds stopped at the end of the year, since difficulties of transport arose. The names of the identified species were published previously (Schuster 1949). The present author wishes to draw attention to the Cyanophyceae communities of two ponds with different vegetation. The data concerning these ponds were received from Mr. Schuster.

N2  - Recently (1955) I have published a new version of a phylogenetical tree of the Cormophyta, based on morphology, mainly ramification, leaf types, and sporangia. The concept is monophyletic but its basis is strewn with so many queries that the way is open to a number of different opinions. I add a corrected copy of my chart at the end of the present paper (fig. 2), so as to enable the reader to compare my views with those of Greguss (fig. 1).The difficulty lies of course in our still extremely scanty knowledge of the very oldest land plants and of whether one or several eventually more or less closely related algal groups have succeeded in conquering dry land and converting themselves into true land plants in which the greater part of the sporophyte developed into aerial shoots. As a matter of course the fact whether a progeny should be considered to have originated mono- or polyphyletically merely depends on the degree of relatedness of the ancestral group (s). Mono- and polyphyly may seem controversial when extreme cases are compared; actually they are connected by a series of gradual differences just like mono- and polytopy, analogy and homology, and the like, whose criteria may be found in the fields of time, space and/ or genealogical relationship.

N2  - These fascicles, the first part of a moss flora of Fennoscandia, comprise five (acrocarpous) orders of the Eubryales. All species and a number of forms and varieties have been included. There are clear dichotomous keys to genera and species. Of each species the original literature, the most familiar synonyms, an excellent description with critical remarks on the differences between allied species and original drawings have been given. Ecology and general distribution have been indicated, with special reference to Scandinavia. In addition there is a glossary of technical terms, which is nearly identical to that in Dixon’s famous Student’s Handbook of British Mosses, though less extensive.Nevertheless it may be doubted whether this book actually fills a need in Scandinavian bryology. It is not suited for “workers in all fields of botany, forestry, limnology, etc.”, as the author suggests, since keys to the families are lacking. Besides, there is the excellent moss flora of Brotherus, Die Laubmoose Fennoscandias, not mentioned in this connection in the preface.

N2  - During a recent treatment of the Proteaceae for “Flora Malesiana” it has become evident that a revision of the generic status of all proteaceous taxa reported from S. Asia and Malaysia as well as from the adjacent regions of Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia and subtropical-tropical Australia had to be made to reach a satisfactory correlation of the genera and species concerned as a basis for the discussion of phytogeographical relations both within and outside the proper Malaysian area. During this work it appeared necessary to transfer some species to other genera. A revision of the genus Helicia showed that a group of species had to be segregated as a distinct new genus Heliciopsis.My studies are based on herbarium specimens borrowed from the following Institutions: Arnold Arboretum (A), Bot. Mus. Berlin-Dahlem (B, where the type-material of the family remained intact), Bogor (BO), Brisbane (BRI), Calcutta (CAL), Edinburgh (E), Florence (FT), Kepong (KEP), Lae (LAE), Leiden (L), Melbourne (MEL), Miinchen (M), New York (NY), Manila (PNH), Singapore (SING), Stockholm (S) and Utrecht (IT). The material preserved in the British Museum (BM), at Kew (K), and Paris (P) has been studied during a stay at London and Paris.

N2  - — During the last World War Dr Ohwi worked for several years in the Herbarium Bogoriense and compiled a preliminary revision of the Malaysian representatives of the genus Fimbristylis. The absence of any world revision, the temporary inaccessibility of type material, and of adequate literature, were the causes that this revision had an entirely preliminary shape and made it inadvisable to publish the MS as it was, due to circumstances alluded to above.Fortunately Mr J. H, Kern, who is in charge of the colossal job of organizing the revision of Cyperaceae for the Flora Malesiana, has undertaken the delicate, time-consuming task of carefully checking the novelties distinguished by Dr Ohwi, which are to be incorporated in his own revision of the genus. Some species distinguished by Dr Ohwi have appeared to be conspecific with already described species from other parts of the palaeotropics, others have since 1941 been described by contemporaneous workers on the genus. The following species have hitherto stood the test and are at present accepted by Mr Kern and Dr Ohwi as good new species. Permission for publication was readily granted both by the Keeper of the Herbarium Bogoriense and by Dr Ohwi. I am exceedingly grateful both to them and to Mr Kern for their mutual trust and co-operation and their generous attitude. C. G. G. J. VAN STEENIS.

N2  - In a posthumous paper of Gagnepain a new monotypic genus Tardiella annamensis Gagn. has been described, assigned to the Canellaceae (Not. Syst. 15: 32—33. 1954). The author remarks that for a long time Canellaceae were restricted to the New World, but that later one genus, Cinnamosma, from Madagascar was described by Baillon. Warburgia occurs further in tropical East Africa.The characters of the new genus seemed rather aberrant in Canellaceae which possess 3 sepals instead of 5 in Tardiella, in the fascicled flowers. Phytographically the occurrence of a Canellacea in Tonkin would he most remarkable. The translucent dots and lines in the leaves led me to suspect identity with Casearia with which the description fits very well indeed.

There is one new species (H. mollis, from Halmaheira) and one new forma ( H. acuminatus, fa glabrior) and the area of the genus has possibly to be extended to include Palau. I would not be surprised at all if it would turn up in some of the Philippines Islands.Female flowers have been described for the first time of H. borneensis. Both in that species and in H. clementium the inflorescences have now been found to occasionally possess more or less abortive vegetative buds. This seems more and more a character of generic importance.

N2  - Evolution has for a century and a half been the subject of both speculation and research. It has been approached from almost every imaginable side. However, while on the one hand the fossil evidence has provided us with the main lines of development both of characters and of taxa, and on the other comparison of living organisms mutually and experiments of various kinds have given us some insight into the processes which may play a part in the mechanism of evolutionary development, the two methods of research are still separated by a wide gap and in spite of many efforts we are far from understanding what is really happening and what the admittedly necessary connection between the framework and the skin may be.In a recently published book the Swiss artist-botanist Erich Nelson has offered a contribution to the static (or short-time) side of the problem. It must be admitted that his considerations are bearing on a part of the field only (viz. Angiosperm flowers) and that an ample, though by no means exclusive use is made of facts which were already known, this does not lessen the merit of the author that he has contrived to open up a new and promising field of research by expounding a rather bold but consistently argumented theory which seems well worth considering.

N2  - During the study of the Xyridaceae of the Malaysian area it was desirable to study those of Australia and Continental Asia as well. The Malaysian species now have, in the meantime, been published (Flora Malesiana, ser. 1, 4, 1953, 366—376). To the new taxa described in Blumea 7, 1953, 307—308 the Latin diagnoses of the following new species and a new section may here be added: 1. Xyris linifolia van Royen, nov. spec. — Fig. 1. Herba mediocris, ad 40 cm alta. Folia subulata, ad 25 cm longa, c. 1 cm diam., subfalcata, acuta, sparse papillata; vaginae 6—8 cm longae, basi 3—6 mm latae; ligula brevis acuta c. 1 mm longa. Scapus 20—40 cm, c. 1 mm diam., teretiusculus, 2- vel pluricostatus, minute papillatus. Capitula ovoidea ad globosa, pauciflora, ad 7 X 6 mm, bracteae basales suborbiculares, 4.5—5.5 X 3.5—4 mm, obtusae, enerves, in parte superiori minute papillatae, papillis arcum triangularem formantibus, medianae obovatae, 6—6.5 X 4.5—5 mm, nervosae, nervis nervo mediano et uno nervo completo in costae utroque latere orto ad bracteae apicem laxe reticulato compositis, in parte mediana superiori minute papillatae, papillis aream suborbicularem formantibus. Flores masculini ignoti, florum femineorum sepala lateralia angusta, 5.5—6.5 X c. 1.5 mm, acutiuscula, emarginata, ecristata, alata, alis sat latis, sepalum medianum cucullatum, 4.5—5 X c. 2 mm, binerve. Petala nondum evoluta limbo orbiculari 4 mm longo et lato munita, margine serrata, unguiculo c. 2 mm. Stamina c. 3 mm, antherae c. 2 mm, apice profunde emarginatae, basi apiceque obtusae thecis emarginatis. Staminodia 2.5—3 mm, penicillata bifida? Ovarium incomplete cognitum, stylus 4.5—5 mm (vel longior?), trifidus, ramificationibus c. 2.5 mm, apice capitatis. Capsula ignota. Typus: Smiles s. n. in K. Distr.: Siam — in open grassland near base of Mt Kau. This species differs from all Malaysian species except X. borneensis in the terete leaves and the three complete nerves of the bracts. Though the leaves of X. borneensis are also terete, the bracts are provided with numerous complete nerves. Moreover, the lateral sepals in X. borneensis are ciliate, those of X. linifolia smooth and entire. In its anthers the present species resembles X. ridleyi, X. pauciflora, X. borneensis, X. capensis, X. complanata etc., the anthers being deeply incised at the top and the thecae emarginate. 2. Xyris nigromucronata van Royen, nov. spec. — Fig. 2. Herba annua parva, ad 6 cm alta. Folia linearia, 1—2.5 cm X c. 1 mm, mucronata, apice nigra et pilis robustis paucis hispida, anguste bi-alata, alis tenuiter et sparse papillatis, in parte basali elliptica in sectione transversa, apice incrassata et triangularia in sectione transversa, vaginae 3— 6 cm longae, apice pilis multis albis munitae, margine membranacea, marginibus pedunculi basin includentibus, pedunculo ligula biloba pilis destituta praedito. Scapus ad 6 cm longus, subangularis, valde obscure alatus, alis 1 vel 2, proxime infra capitulum elatus ubi 3- vel 4-alatus. Capitula oblongo-ellipsoidea, c. 7 X 5 mm, bracteae omnes cristatae, basales ovatae, c. 6.5 X 3 mm, sat brunneo-nigrae, mucronatae, mucrone ad 2.5 mm longa, cristata, nigra, crista pallide flava in parte apicali tantum tenuiter et sparse papillata, medianae subcirculares ad panduriformes, 4—5 X 2—5 mm, margine sat brunneo-nigrae, uninerves, nervo completo laevi, in parte basali membranaceae. Sepala lateralia naviculata, fere ad apicem connata, c. 5 X 1 mm, membranacea ecristata. Petala 6, alba, 6—7 mm longa, unguiculata, ungui 4—5 mm, arcte cohaerentia et quasi tubulosa, limbo elliptico-oblongo, obtuso, c. 2 X 0.8 mm. Stamina 6, c. 1.2 mm, antheris ovoideis, c. 0.6 mm, truncatis, emarginatis thecae basi obtusae; filamenta subulata, c. 0.6 mm. Staminodia desunt. Ovarium subovoideum ad ellipsoideum, c. 2 X 1 mm, trilobum, in parte basali 3-, in parte superiori 1-loculare, stigmatibus 3 terminatum. Capsula ovario similis, sed ad 3 X 1.5 mm metiens; semina sparse papillatae. Typus: Pritzel 635 a in L. Distr.: Australia — in scrub between Moore and Murchinson river. This specimen was found mixed with Stylidium bulbiferum Benth. var. septentrionale Mild braed in Pritzel 635. Therefore it is separated from that species under 635 a. This highly characteristic species differs from all other species of Xyris by the fimbriate top of the sheath, the united lateral sepals (also found in the Brasilian X. obtusiuscula Nilsson), the 6 united petals, the 6 stamens (also once found by the author in X. bancana Miquel), the more or less campylotropous ovules, the entire style, and the papillate curved seeds. Moreover, the flowers seem to be white but owing to the dried material it can not be stated for certain whether this is the proper colour. These details warrant the establishment of a separate section in Xyris, Australoxyris with the following Latin diagnosis: Xyris Linnaeus, sect. Australoxyris van Royen, nov. sect. Folia apice in sectione transversa triangularia, vaginae exteriores apice ciliatae, flores capitati; sepala lateralia maxime connata; petala 6, connata; stamina 6; stylus simplex; ovarium in parte basali 3-loculare, in parte superiori 1-loculare; ovula plus minusve campylotropa; semina papillata. Typus: Xyris nigromucronata van Royen.

N2  - In Madroño (1936) Herre has lamented the disappearance of lichen species through the disastrous interference of man. Unavoidably, the advance of civilised modern life is linked with destruction of the vegetation. This applies all the more as the endangered area is more densely populated and it certainly applies most alarmingly to the lichen flora of the Netherlands. Here, every way-side tree felled is an irreparable loss to the epiphytic lichen communities, every acre of heath burnt or turned into arable land is a blow to our stock of terrestrial lichen species, whereas the use of dry fertilisers and the spraying of orchards are very effective in killing any lichen in the neighbourhood that otherwise might have survived. A comparison of the material preserved in the older collections with what can be found nowadays, clearly shows what has gone lost. It is sad to think that an ever increasing number of species are on their way to total extermination.However, from a thorough investigation of the epiphytic communities of cryptogams latterly started by Mr J. J. Barkman, it becomes apparent that at least to some extent the losses may be compensated by the discovery of species hitherto overlooked or not recognised. It is on such and other finds that I intend to report from time to time.

N2  - Exbucklandia R. W. Brown ( Bucklandia R. Br. non Pr. ex Sternb., Symingtonia Steen.) In an article on “Alterations in some fossil and living floras” (J. Wash. Ac. Sc. 36: 348. Oct. 1946) R. W. Brown proposed the new generic name Exbucklandia for the Hamamelidaceous genus Bucklandia R. Br., non Pr. ex Sternb., while describing a new fossil species from the United States. He also transferred B. populnea to the new genus. Unfortunately I had overlooked this publication when proposing Symingtonia to replace Bucklandia R. Br. (Acta Bot. Neerl. 1: 443—444. 1952). Exbucklandia will have to be accepted for it in future. The Indo-Chinese species B. tonkinensis Lecomte should be referred to as Exbucklandia tonkinensis (Lecomte) Steen. comb. nov. I have to thank Dr E. H. Walker for pointing my attention to R. W. Brown’s paper.

N2  - A new species of Amomum from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is illustrated and described. The plant shows similarity with A. hypoleucum of South India and Sri Lanka in vegetative habit. The species can be distinguished by the presence of silvery silky abaxial side of lamina with appressed pubescence, creeping slender rhizomes, many flowered spike with short peduncle produced directly from base of the aerial stem, green to orange coloured persistent bracts arranged in two rows, glabrous anther and many fruits produced with prominent irregularly lobed ridges. A comparison with other Amomum species of the Andaman Islands is also provided.

N2  - In 1934 Dr van Steenis recorded Elisma natans (L.) Buch. for the first time outside Europe, viz. from Java. This unusual record was based on a single specimen collected in 1932 by Dr A. Kleinhoonte in Central Java at 2000 m altitude on Mt Diëng, now preserved in the Herbarium Bogoriense. Miss Kleinhoonte assumed there was little doubt that she had collected it in Java. After having collected information from the Fisheries Department in Java, that no Elisma was ever planted by that Service, Dr van Steenis stated (1, p. 175): “Though it is a waterplant, I cannot account for this enormous discontinuity.” A year later (2, p. 55) he gave a figure of the specimen and concluded that he felt forced to accept the species as a native of Java.However, he nursed a feeling that there was something wrong in this forced assumption. The pools on Mt Diëng are easy to reach and have been subjected to repeated botanical field work by experienced botanists onwards of Junghuhn. His doubt was later still strengthened by the fact that shortly before the war, the late Mr J. G. T. Loogen, a planter and enthusiastic amateur-botanist living N. of Mt Diëng, repeatedly searched the spot where Elisma was said to be found but without success.

N2  - A study has been made of the Indo-Malaysian species of Cnestis. The mutual length ratio of sepals and petals, — brevi- and aequipetaly —, is the main differentiating character for the species; there are no transitions. The areas of distribution overlap in the Malay Peninsula (fig. 1); brevipetalous types are known from the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo and Celebes, aequipetalous types from Burma, Siam, Indo-China and the Andaman Islands, the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines. Fruits are of two different shapes: beaked in aequipetalae of the Andamans, Burma, Siam, and Indo-China, pear-shaped in remaining aequipetalae and in brevipetalae. Leaves tend to be longer and jugae more numerous in brevipetalae than in aequipetalae.Other characters do not have so clear a separating value, such as texture and indumentum of leaflets, indumentum of inflorescence, texture and indumentum of petals, length of stamens, type and length of pistils, length ratio of stamens and pistils. However, even on the strength of these characters there is some reason to distinguish both groups mentioned above. As to the indumentum of petals there is a remarkable cline in a decreasing sense from the Philippines to continental Asia, the Andamans and the Malay Peninsula and back to the east through the brevipetalae of Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo and Celebes.Brevi- and aequipetalae have been considered to represent two species, viz Cnestis platantha Griff. and Cnestis palala (Lour.) Merrill. The latter one has been divided into two subspecies, viz subsp. palala with beaked fruits and subsp. diffusa (Blanco) Andreas with pear-shaped fruits. For their area of distribution see fig. 1.In many respects some plants of the Andamans, Burma, Siam, Indo-China (and the Malay Peninsula) are different from the remaining aequipetalae, but not in a uniform way as to the various characters. Although there are some arguments for a further taxonomic subdivision, we did not think it advisable to introduce such a division at present. Our classification differs from the division as given by Schellenberg (1938). This was caused by the material on one hand, being more heterogeneous than Schellenberg described it, and, on the other hand, by the fact that some of the diagnostic characters used by him, in our opinion were not fit for use as such. Therefore a revision of Schellenberg’s system of the genus Cnestis seems desirable.

N2  - This charming and handy book printed on excellent paper, with its numerous clear pictures of well-known Malayan plants, reminds one in many ways of Merrill’s “Plant Life of the Pacific World” (MacMillan 1946, New York), which has perhaps served Prof. Holttum as an example. Its size being only slightly smaller than Merrill’s book and the area covered being very considerably smaller, its descriptions of plants are naturally more detailed; the more so as only a choice has been made, in which the special interests of the author — ferns, orchids, gingers — are evident though not predominant.The plants described are not regionally arranged. The 17 chapters are rather headed by names of life-forms, striking organs, and special habitats. As is pointed out in the Preface, the book is “intended primarily for the Malayan resident who wishes to begin a study of Malayan plants”. In this purpose the book will doubtless prove to be a success: the reader is gradually taught quite a bit of botany of various fields, morphology, anatomy, ecology, hybridisation, etc. These are demonstrated at plants which are within easy reach of the ordinary layman for which it is destined. Short opening and concluding chapters deal with general features of tropical plants and with the Malayan forest. Since the author is a well-known expert and the Malayan flora as here described is a very good example of any flora between, say, Calcutta and Fiji, it may well be useful to residents of many other countries as well.

N2  - Argostemma Wall. (type species: A. verticillatum Wall.).This large Old World genus, comprising about 240 binomials of which, ca 70-80 will prove to be distinct species, has been almost unanimously left undivided. Exceptions are Reinwardt who in 1825 created the genus Pomangium, independently of Wallich (1824) and Ridley who in 1927 based the genus Argostemmella on two Bornean species of Argostemma. My revision (in msc.) of Argostemma occurring in Malaysia confirmed the common view that there is no reason for splitting up this genus. However, several subdivisions (sections) can reasonably be accepted. As those sections mostly represent well-delimited taxa in connection with a rather evident distribution of their own, I propose here the following 5 sections for Argostemma. It should be borne in mind that I have examined almost all extra-Mallaysian species too.

N2  - In den Jahren 1935 und 1936 sammelte C. E. Carr in Papua u. a. auch ziemlich viele Moose. Diese Sammlung wurde H. N. Dixon zur Bearbeitung übergeben. Die Originale der von diesem Bryologen aus dieser Sammlung kurz vor und während dem Kriege neu beschriebenen Arten liegen in seinem Herbarium, das jetzt im British Museum untergebracht ist. Ein Teil der Carr’schen Sammlung wurde vom Rijksherbarium in Leiden angekauft, darunter auch viele Nummern, die jetzt als Cotypen der Dixon’ schen novae species gelten können. Da der Ankauf schon vor dem Kriege betätigt wurde, diese Moose also noch nicht bestimmt waren, überliess Herr Prof. Dr. H. J. Lam, der Direktor des Rjjksherbariums., mir diese Moose noch während dem Kriege in liebenswürdiger Weise zur Bestimmung, wofür ich ihm auch hier danken möchte. Erst nach dem Kriege konnten die inzwischen über diese Moose erschienenen Veröffentlichungen Dixon’s eingesehen und mit meinen eigenen Befunden verglichen werden. Ueber das Resultat möchte ich im Folgenden berichten.Fissidens wichurae Broth. et Fl. in Hedw. 38, 1899, p. 127. — Fissidens pungentissimus Dixon in Journ. of Bot., Jan. 1942, p. 2.

The representatives from Malaysia have been dealt with more extensively in the revision of the genus in Flora Malesiana, Ser. I, Vol. 4, 4th instalment, 1953, pp. 404—431. — Technical descriptions of new taxa have been published in another paper in Blumea 7, 1953, pp. 310—319.In the present paper the literature will be published more extensively than in Flora Malesiana; besides I have included citation of all type specimens. The extra-Malaysian species have been studied less extensively than the Malaysian ones, but as I have seen nearly all the types, some notes are inserted which will be, I hope, useful for future study of the genus. Particularly the specimens from the Indian Peninsula need closer study.

N2  - Within the Sapotaceae, the tribe of the Madhuceae presents a very homogeneous group. One point of view is to consider it a single polymorphous genus. The opposite opinion was expressed by Pierre, who distinguished a number of small genera, many on futile characters. Amongst those which stood later criticism is the genus Ganua which was, however, not published by Pierre but by Dubard (1907, 1908a, 201 and 1908b, 407), who adopted Pierre’s Ms names and made use of his extensive annotations.The name Ganua is derived from the word ganu, the native name for latex produced by a tree, “used for falsifying the valuable products of ‘gutta terbu’” (f. Errington de la Croix in schedula; cf p. 389).

N2  - More than twenty years have elapsed since the senior author (H. J. Lam) recognized Haplolobus as a genus separate from Canarium. In the mean time much newly collected material has become available and in view of the intended revision for Flora Malesiana, the time has come to sum up our present knowledge.It must be said first of all that this knowledge, in spite of a considerable progress, is still far from satisfactory. Not only is much of the material sterile, but the genus however small it is, more and more proves to be an extremely difficult one to handle in a practicable way. Whether or not this is due to its phylogenetic youth is of little consequence. The fact stands that we have to deal with a genus in which the subgeneric limits, even if intuitively recognizable to the experienced eye, are so evasive as to make it extremely difficult to show them clearly to the man of practice who has to work with the species and the names attributed to them.

N2  - On March 7, 1953 the Rijksherbarium suffered a severe loss by the sudden death of its honorary co-operator Dr. D. F. van Slooten, the wellknown specialist particularly of Dipterocarpaceae. To honour his memory the following lines may serve as an obituary note.Dirk Fok van Slooten was born in Amersfoort on 17 March 1891. In the local gymnasium his biology teacher was the later Prof. A. Pulle, who was again his master at the University of Utrecht where he was matriculated in 1910. His doctor’s thesis of 1919 was dealing with the Combretaceae and Flacourtiaceae of the Dutch East Indies.

N2  - The editor has received the first and second fascicle of a treatise of the vascular plants of West Virginia. According to the preface this flora, when complete, will present descriptions, illustrations, geographical data and other information, particularly of local interest for the approximately 2000 species found growing without cultivation in that State. The first part contains the Pteridophyta, Gymnospermae, and Monocotyledoneae, the second part the Dicotyledoneae, p.p. (Saururaceae-Leguminosae). Keys are given for genera and species. The rather short descriptions are completed by many for the greater part original line drawings. Nomenclature and sequence are those of the 8th edition of Gray’s Manual, 1950, by M. L. Fernald.

N2  - The present paper is an extension of my revision of the Malaysian species of the genus Dillenia L. (Wormia Rottb. included) inserted in the revision of the Dilleniaceae in the Flora Malesiana ser. I, vol. 4, part 3, pp. 141—174, published in December 1951. A critical revision of the whole genus has never been published before; the unfortunate result of this has been that the delimitation of Dillenia and Wormia, usually as distinct genera, has been based on different characters by various authors. The extension of the revision for the Flora Malesiana so as to include the extra-malaysian species enabled me to study a number of species, the knowledge of which certainly confirmed me in my idea that the characters on which Dillenia and Wormia had been separated before are certainly not the primary characters, to be used in the taxonomic treatment of the genus.All specimens and literature mentioned in this work have been examined by me, unless indicated otherwise; excepted are the specimens of the U.S. National Herbarium., of which I have only examined those collections, of which no duplicates were available from other herbaria. Particulars, not to be taken from the herbarium specimens themselves, such as habit, height, diameter, colour, etc., have been taken from the collectors’ notes and, as far as reliable, from the literature, and are inserted in the descriptions; if there are contradictory data, they are discussed under the Notes.

This work was repeatedly interrupted on account of official duties. Pending the full account of the work in the Journal of the Arnold Arboretum I regret that it seems necessary to safeguard my conclusions as soon as possible.

N2  - After the senior writer, together with W. W. Varossieau, had published a revision of this monogeneric family (Blumea III, 1938—’39 and IV, 1941), some more material has been examined by us and, moreover, some new species have been described. Thanks to the courtesy of Prof. F. Gagnepain of Paris, and the Director of the Musee d’Histoire Naturelle, Phanérogamic, we had the opportunity to examine the type specimens of Gagnepain's new species from Indo-China, All with all we felt that a new key and a brief enumeration of the species with the main literature, their synonyms and distribution, might be useful.SARCOSPERMATACEAE H.

N2  - A revision of the species, comprised in the section Eu-Protium of the genus Protium from the region from Asia to Australia incl., might., in view of the elaborate publications by H. J. Lam (The Burseraceae of the Malay Archipelago and Peninsula etc., Bull. Jard. bot. Buitenzorg, S. 3, 12, 1932, p. 318—324) and J. J. Swart (A Monograph of the genus Protium and some allied genera, Rec. Trav. bot. néerl., 39, 1942, p. 211—146), seem superfluous. However, an examination of the Clemens material from New-Guinea of 1939 and of the type material of the thusfar mysterious Bursera tonkinensis Guill. justified the publication of some notes thereon. To these some remarks concerning observations on other species have been added.I am much indebted to the directors of the following herbaria for the loan of material: the herbarium of the Botanisches Museum, Berlin; the herbarium of the Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Plain, Mass. (A); the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; the herbarium of the Museum d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris; the herbarium of the Botanical Institute, Wroclaw (BRSL); the “Rijksherbarium”, Leiden (L).

N2  - So far as we know, all Burseraccae have been described as shrubs or trees, ranging from small and slender to very lofty.Some recently discovered material, however, pointed at the possibility that scandent representatives, if perhaps not true lianes, are not entirely lacking in the family. The first specimen intimating this habit to have come to our knowledge was collected by J.  M. S. Clemens on Mt. Kinabalu in British North Borneo, with the emphatic addition “surely scandent”. This specimen is almost certainly a Dacryodes in the relationship of rugosa (Bl.) H. J. Lam, var. virgata (Bl.) H. J. Lam. It appeared to deserve specific rank and it has been described by the junior writer underneath as D. scandens. Full particulars are give there.

N2  - Thusfar the genus Dacryodes, as far as the Australasian area is concerned, was only known to occur in Western Malaysia (including the Philippines), with a centre in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. Only one, out of 13, species is extending towards Cochin China in the West and the Philippines and N. Celebes in the East and another is known from the Malay Peninsula, British N. Borneo and the Philippines (cf. the senior writer’s paper in Bull. Jard. Bot. Buitenzorg, sér. III, Vol. XII, 1932, 334—366).Thus, Dacryodes was so far considered one of the many exclusively or preponderantly west-malaysian genera which do not or hardly cross Wallace’s line.

N2  - Dr Van Ooststroom’s revision of the genus Argyreia in this series (Blumea V, 2, 1943, p. 352) did not include the collections from the Philippines and the Malay Peninsula. The species from the Philippines have been treated later on by Van Ooststroom (Blumea VI, 2, 1950, p. 337), whereas further additions were given in Blumea V, 3, 1945, p. 686 and Blumea VII, 1, 1952, p. 170. The representatives from the Malay Peninsula remained uninvestigated so far.The present paper should be considered an addition to Van Ooststroom’s papers. Consequently I have not repeated the lists of literature, descriptions, or remarks, unless important additions or changes were necessary.

N2  - In my paper on Parmeliaceae (in Blumea, vol. 6, 1947) some remarks have been made concerning the taxa below the rank of species (p. 3—4), one of them being the statement that I was to try to hold an intermediate course between those authors accepting multitudes of varieties and forms, and others abandoning them all. In the eyes of both I may have failed.In the present paper I am going to alienate myself still farther from the former group of authors in reducing varieties to forms and doing away with many other forms. Although in a way this contradicts my inclination towards a meticulous classification in my former paper, it should be borne in mind that not all genera in lichenology can be treated alike. I still believe in varieties and forms — considering e.g. Parmelia physodes very good illustration — but on the other hand I am well aware now that in following Hillmann, whom I shall always gratefully remember for his kind help during the early days of my lichenological training, I have been decidedly all too punctilious.

N2  - Licania subg. Angelesia is composed of only three species restricted to Southeast Asia and is currently delimited as one of four subgenera of Licania, a species-rich genus of mostly Neotropical taxa. Molecular phylogenetic studies involving Chrysobalanaceae have revealed that Licania is polyphyletic. Here we propose to re-establish Licania subg. Angelesia to generic rank based on molecular and morphological evidence and the three species currently placed in Licania subg. Angelesia (Licania fusicarpa, L. palawanensis and L. splendens) are here re-instated and transferred to Angelesia, as appropriate. This new generic delimitation renders Licania an exclusively Neotropical genus, and Angelesia an endemic Southeast Asian genus.

Some flowering material was collected and at our request Mr Parham was good enough to send some ripe fruits in liquid for an investigation I was entrusted with.Additional material was studied from the herbaria at Brisbane, Kew, Leiden, Melbourne and Paris. It is my pleasant duty to tender my best thanks to the directors of these institutes for the loan of this valuable material, among which the type.

The intention was to collect 12 sets of each number which I managed to do for about 70 %.Except for the first set which will be incorporated in the Rijksherbarium, the plants will be sold to those institutes in Europe, S. Africa and America which had subscribed in advance. It is expected, however, that a few more sets in excess of the 12 aforementioned will be available. It should be noted that these will prove rather incomplete, numbering less than 30 % of the total amount.

Kloos, who passed away in his home at Dordrecht on June 3rd, 1952. A more detailed obituary may follow here.Abraham Willem Kloos was born at Wormerveer on April 10th, 1880. At West-Knollendam he attended his father’s school, afterwards went to the secondary school at Zaandam, and, in 1903, he took his degree as a civil engineer at Delft. Then, from 1904 till 1905 he worked as a teacher to the Nautical School, Schiermonnikoog, and from 1905 till 1911 he taught at the Secondary School, Goes. In the latter year Kloos was appointed to the Technical School, Dordrecht, where he worked until his retirement in 1945.

N2  - For more than thirty years the well-known Swedish palynologist Dr G. Erdtman has consistently gathered facts about pollen types. Pollen-analysis led him, naturally, and necessarily, to pollen morphology, so as to lay a safe basis for further palaeobotanical work.It will be a surprise to many a reader of the above book that the term, “palynology”, already very familiar among botanists, was only coined in 1944. This term, mostly but apparently erroneously applied in a palaeobotanical sense only, just means “pollen science” and is therefore more or less synonymous to pollen (external) morphology 8.1.

N2  - At the instigation of the Director of the “Rijksherbarium” at Leiden, Prof. Dr H. J. Lam, who was puzzled by the problem of the delimitation of the genus Isonandra towards other genera, especially Palaquium, I assumed the task to compose a monograph of Isonandra. For this study material was kindly put at our disposal by the directors of several institutes, which enabled me to check up the type-specimens of all species, except that of Isonandra emarginata H. J. Lam, which failed to turn up even at Singapore and at Borneo. However, the Isonandra-character of this species is doubtful: it is more like Palaquium.It is my pleasant duty to express my sincere thanks to the directors of the institutes mentioned underneath, for their valuable cooperation. Our thanks also due to Mr T. P. Nedungadi, M. A. of the Embassy of India at The Hague, whose kind intermediary enabled me to consult detailed maps of India and Ceylon.

N2  - Trees with leaves crowded at tip of thick branchlets; stipules subulate or narrowly deltoid, caducous; leaves, obovate or obovate-oblong, tertiary nerves ascending near the midrib, transverse near the margins of the leaf; flowers crowded at tips of branchlets, forming a pseudo-terminal, many-florous inflorescence; calyx with two whorls of two lobes each; corolla exsert, tube solid, pubescent without at apex, petals 8, imbricate; stamens 9—40, inserted in one or two rows in the throat; style subulate, exsert, glabrous; ovary glabrous, 3—8-celled, cells 1-ovuled, ovules attached at the apex of the central axis; sometimes an indistinct annular disc present; fruit large, often edible, crowned by the persistent style; fruit usually 1-seeded; seed ovoid with large to very large scar and apical hilum; testa thick, crustaceous; albumen none or membranous, if present especially around the radicle; cotyledons fleshy; radicle inferior, not exsert — 11 species distributed from the Moluccas to the Samoa and Tonga Islands.The last revision of this genus was given by Lam in 1942. After a small but important publication of White (J. Arn. Arb. 31, 1, 1950, 104) and the investigation of some new collections it seemed appropriate to give a concise revision of this genus in preparation for the “Flora Malesiana”. Some new species are described and of some old ones more details are given. The publications of Lam are abbreviated as follows: 1925 = The Sapotaceae, etc. of the Dutch East Indies, Bull. Jard. Bot. Bzg, sér. 3, 7, 1925, 112. Lam 1927 = Further studies etc., Bull. Jard. Bot. Bzg, sér. 3, 8, 1927, 381. Lam 1932 = Sapotaceae, in Nova Guinea 14, 4, 1932, 554. Lam 1942 = A tentative list of wild Pacific Sap. etc., Blumea 5, I, 1942, 36.

N2  - Trees; leaves with caducous stipules; tertiary nervation descendant, but usually lax and irregular; inflorescences clustered, axillary, manyflorous; calyx with two rows of four lobes each; corolla 8-merous, each lobe with 2 dorsal segments as long as itself; stamens epipetalous, 8, in the same row as the 8 alternipetalous staminodes; ovary usually 8-celled; cells 1-ovuled, ovules anatropous, attached at the base; fruit a berry, 1—2-seeded; seeds with a small, circular, basal scar, in which the hilum and the micropyle are placed close to one another; albumen abundant; cotyledons thin, foliaceous; radicle long, cylindrical, exsert — About 80 species in all tropical countries, except in America.In 1925, Lam (Bull. Jard. Bot. Bzg, sér. 3, 7, 1925, 235—237) described of M. elengi three varieties, var. typica, var. parvifolia and var. brevifolia and a forma longepedunculata in the type-variety. As was pointed out already by him, the differences between the two new varieties are slight, if existing at all. As those between M. elengi and M. parvifolia were obscured by many intermediate stages Lam was forced to consider the latter a variety of the former. Studying the more abundant material at our disposal it becomes clear that M. elengi is an extremely variable species in which it is impossible to distinguish varieties or forms. However, it must be pointed out that in the western parts of the Archipelago the leaves are large (up to 18 cm long), whereas they are decreasing in size towards the east, ending in the small leaves of the former species M. parvifolia (up to 6 cm long).

N2  - There has been considerable confusion over the name Verbesina pseudoacmella and V. acmella published by Linnaeus in the Species Plantarum (1753, p. 901). He applied these names to definitions taken from his earlier work, Flora Zeylanica (1748, p. 144, 145, nos. 308 and 309), with only one unimportant alteration. The title page of the Flora Zeylanica shows that the book is intended as an account of Hermann’s plants, and this is confirmed for the two species concerned by the close agreement between the descriptions published and the specimens in Hermann’s Herbarium preserved in the Department of Botany of the British Museum. These two Linnean species must, therefore, be interpreted by reference to Hermann’s specimens, regardless of the fact that figures cited by Linnaeus in the synonymy of each species (viz. Seba, Thesaur. 1, t. 10, 11; Plukenet, Alm. t. 159, f. 4) are of the plant which generally has been known as Spilanthes acmella.In 1888, Trimen published notes on Hermann’s Herbarium (Journ. Linn. Soc. Lond. (Bot.) vol. 24, p. 129); he identified the specimens representing these two species as follows: No. 308, Verbesina pseudo-acmella, as possibly a young specimen of Wedelia biflora DC.; and No. 309, Verbesina acmella, as Blainvillea latifolia DC. A drawing included in the herbarium he identified as “Spilanthes acmella”. As this drawing was not mentioned by Linnaeus, it must not be considered when interpreting the species. In his revision of the genus Spilanthes, A. H. Moore (Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts  Sci. 42, 1907, p. 521) rejected the name Verbesina pseudoacmella L. as referring to a mixture of genera, but retained “Verbesina acmella L.” as the basis of a species of Spilanthes.

N2  - Though the new names published in Thunberg’s “Florida” have been entered in the Index Kewensis, few botanists have tried to verify the status and synonymy of the new species proposed in this 2-thesis booklet. Thunberg’s names were entered in Juel’s “Plantae Thunbergianae” (1918, 412 pp.).The diagnoses are generally too short and vague to allow a definite opinion. Only Schott, Mueller Arg., and F. E. Wimmer have examined material of resp. the Araceae, Euphorbiaceae, Campanulaceae.

N2  - During the long years I was engaged in writing my “Mikrographie” (1), my main purpose was to give a survey of the wood-anatomy of as many representatives of the javanesc wood flora as I could lay hands on, in connection with Koorders’ and Valeton’s “Bijdragen” (2). My attention being almost exclusively absorbed by the descriptive side of my task, little attention was paid to eventual conclusions regarding family relationships, though some were incidentally pointed out.When this work of long years was completed, the need of a key for the identification of wood samples was felt. This I composed and completed just before the war. It was published in 1940 and written in German (3), as was the main work on which it was based. Immediately an English translation was prepared but though this was ready for the press as early as 1942, I was prevented from publishing it, at first because of the German occupation and later on for want of funds.

N2  - In the “Mikrographie des Holzes der auf Java vorkommenden Baumarten” I described 991 kinds of wood. Several of these belong to large genera, the majority to small. I found remarkably wide variations in the wood-anatomy of several specimens belonging to a single species of a large genus. These intraspecific differences in large genera are generally larger than interspecific differences in small genera.When identifying species by means of wood-anatomical characters, the wide intraspecific variability in large genera obstructs identification whereas in small genera identification is usually relatively easily executed. As a result, it is much easier to compose a key to the species in a small genus than in a large one. In my key to the Javan woods (Anatomische Bestimmungstabelle für die javanischen Hölzer, 1940, 83) it is repeatedly demonstrated; also in Mikrographie passim that taxonomic relationships are often blurred by this peculiar circumstance.

Mangrove woods proved to be different from woods belonging to species growing in other stations even if those species belonged to the same family or even genus. The data may be traced in my “Mikrographie” but it seems more convenient to review them here.

It almost seems as if there is some factor of exclusion affecting that great region, and there is no indication of any corresponding degree of relation between tropical Africa and New Caledonia such as has been detected between the latter and Madagascar.

N2  - Little attention has been paid till now to the algae, transported to the Netherlands coast on drifting objects. About a century ago T. D. Vrijdag Zijnen and G. Bisschop (near Scheveningen, ± 1845), and L. H. Buse (between Wijk aan Zee and Zandvoort, ± 1840—1847) were the first to pay attention to this subject. The material collected, especially that by the first two investigators, is mentioned in the Prodromus Fl. Bat. (1853). The book of Van Goor (1923) contains a chapter on these algae, in which, however, only few new observations occur. The author is much indebted to Dr Josephine Th. Koster for her kind help, as well as to Dr S. J. v. Ooststroom. The material, collected by Vrijdag Zijnen, Bisschop and Buse is almost completely present in the collections of the ‘Rijksherbarium’ and the ‘Koninklijke Ncderlandse Botanische Vereniging’, Leiden. The material, collected during the last few years has for the greater part been brought together by the present author, and furthermore especially by K. Swennen (Den Helder), J. Stock (Amsterdam), A. Mulder (Haarlem) and P. Leenhouts (Scheveningen). This material belongs to the collection of the Rijksherbarium, Leiden, but most of it is, for the time being, put under the charge of the “Comité ter Bestudering van de Nederlandse Mariene Flora en Fauna” (“Committee on the Netherlands’ Marine Flora and Fauna”) and temporarily preserved in “Het Filiaal”, Leiden.

N2  - It is a pleasant duty to announce a work to which all students of the Malaysian Flora, and I am sure, many others, have been looking forward for some time; the first issue of, it is hoped, a very long and continuous series which will ultimately lead to a complete flora of the Malaysian region, including British Malaya, the Philippines and New Guinea which, floristically speaking, forms a natural unit.The work, written in English under the auspices of the Royal Botanic Garden, Buitenzorg (now Bogor), Java, is the result of the painstaking efforts of its Editor-in-Chief, the well-known Buitenzorg botanist, Dr C. G. G. J. van Steenis. Generously supported by his wife in many respects, he has, and under the most difficult circumstances, indefatigably fought to get this extensive project started. Not ony he, but the Indonesian Government as well, are to be congratulated on the result of their efforts. It deserves our sincere and warm appreciation that the Government of this young country has understood its responsibilities and is backing the work with considerable interest, both morally and financially.

N2  - It was shown that the oldest Dutch lichen herbarium known was that of H. Boerhaave dating as far back as the end of the 17th or the beginning of the 18th century. After that there was a long spell of inactivity, until from about 1835 onward the florists again started making herbaria. From the end of the nineteenth century the interest flagged again, and collecting was done by very few people.The first publications which are known to deal with Dutch lichens mentioning the locality do not date back farther than the 17th century, the work by C. Pilleterius (1610) being the oldest one. Those earliest publications comprised but a very small number of lichens, presumably because of few of them the officinal application (the main impetus of getting acquainted with plants) was known yet. In the seventeenth century, the lichens were designated by phrase-names which, with some certainty, may be identified with the Linnean names, but nevertheless remain somewhat obscure. Gradually, in the 18th century, the interest in lichens shifted from the medicinal to the botanical side. The number of lichens known steadily increased, and the binomial nomenclature was more generally applied. The habit of uncritically copying certain successful foreign floras was abandoned, and it grew customary among the florists to publish cheek-lists of own finds, though specific, descriptions were often borrowed from foreign authors. In some cases, however, it still appears uncertain which species were meant, as no material was left. The lichenology in Holland showed its greatest development in the 19th century. Phis was undoubtedly mainly due to the activity of the newly founded Botanical Society (1845), and particularly by the efforts of its undefatigable president R. B .van den Bosch. Except for the experimental investigation by M. Treub (1873), however, the interest in lichens never surpassed the stage of writing enumerations of the local flora. None of the florists felt called upon to study any special group of lichens. In fact, there were no lichenologists proper, and lichenology in Holland was sterile. Whereas in all other countries of Europe the description of new lichen genera and species was in full progress, and other branches connected with lichenology such as anatomy, morphology, ecology, Physiology, and chemistry were being studied, there was an almost complete standstill in the Netherlands which hardly could be made up for by a single outstanding systematical (E. T. Nannenga, 1939) or physiological Paper (A. Quispel, 1943). Of late, however, a revived interest and a determined desire on the part of some sociologists getting more familiar with lichens is apt to brighten up this somewhat gloomy picture.

N2  - The International Association of Wood Anatomists in the early years of its existence has undertaken to standardize the nomenclature used in describing woods. Later the classes of dimensions have been added thereinto.In the same way it should be possible now to standardize one or two identification methods.Universal schemes in the first place will fit for this purpose. In the introduction it is explained which requirements should be fulfilled in such schemes.The advantages and drawbacks of an English and a Dutch identification method are compared mutually. It is suggested, that a procedure according to the Hollerith system will allow of a synthesis of both methods mentioned, thus combining advantages and eliminating their drawbacks. The restriction in the applicability of the Hollerith scheme is determined by the fact, that complicated devices are necessary the costs of which can only be justified, if they are constantly employed at full capacity. Thus the method can only be used in a central office. It will especially yield good results if a close international collaboration is established.A standardized codification and centralized multiplication and distribution of cards are indispensable requirements for realising this purpose. A short general survey is given of the Universal Decimal Classification and it is explained according to which principles wood species have been included in this scheme. The decimal codes of the U.D.C. can be used for indicating botanical and geographical data in the Hollerith identification. In this way, the great advantage is achieved, that a literature card index on wood species can be compiled with the same figure combinations. In doing so these figures get a wider field of application than when independant classifications are made for identification and documentation purposes.

Herbarium Washington, Jan. 1947, some in the Kew Herbarium, Nov. 1946, and some in the Leyden Herbarium, Oct. 1946, enabled me to make some further observations which clarify the status and distribution of the Malaysian species, which I preliminarily treated in the Journ. Arnold Arbor. 27 (1946) 442—452, a little further. 1. Lonicera repens Zipp. ex Miq., Fl. Ind. Bat. 2: 128. 1856; cf. J. Arn. Arb. 27 (1946) 451, was referred by Miquel to L. chinensis, and belongs, according to Ind. Kew and Dr Rehder’s paper to L. japonica Thunb. In the Leyden Herbarium there are 3 authentic sheets; of one the label reads “New Guinea”, of an. other “? Java” and of the third “? Java. ? New Guinea”. All belong doubtless to L. japonica Thunb. and in my opinion this is a clear case of mislabelled specimens which came from Java, probably from specimens cultivated in the Botanic Gardens at Buitenzorg.

Its floral characters are fairly uniform, but the pappus shows a great diversity. The 5 achenes in a head do not mature at the same time. The genus Stevia seems to have its greatest development in Bolivia, where it is represented by 44 species. The next representation is in Peru with 24 and in Argentina with 23 species.Section Eustevia, Robinson.

N2  - It is a generally accepted concept nowadays that dichotomy is the most primitive type of ramification in land plants. Recently Lam (1948) briefly reviewed the literature of this subject in the light of the telome theory. He recalled that the dichotomies of fern leaves are to be regarded as homologous to the dichotomies of stems in more primitive plants and enumerated a number of more or less haphazardly collected cases in higher plants, of which the most probable interpretation is that they are traces of such ancient dichotomies, betraying their original relation to a branch system.In his paper, Lam discriminated between such traces in vegetative and in reproductive parts and he arrived at the provisional conclusion that traces of ancient dichotomies in the vegetative parts should particularly occur in what he termed the ‘phyllosporous’ plants, and that those of the reproductive parts are particularly found in the ‘stachysporous’ groups.

N2  - We always have thoroughly detested the mentality of those scientific periodicals which deemed it proper to introduce politics into their columns. During the war we have repeatedly been offended by the unworthy attitude of the editorial staffs of certain botanical journals of “Greater Germany” who admitted — or possibly even deliberately furthered — perorations stating not only the marvellous achievements of nazi-methods and their amazing usefulness towards the particular field of science covered by the periodical in question, but the faith and the devotion of their persons towards the sacred cause of the nazi-system.We have, as I say, not exactly admired this mentality in a scientific paper and we will not follow the example. However, too much has happened in the five long and hard years of bloody oppression by ruthless and barbarian enemies, both in Holland and in Indonesia, that this crucial moment in our national history could be passed without any comment even by a stolid and, allegedly, unemotional Hollander. For never more distinctly than in the past five years have we been enabled to state — or state again, as the case may be — how utterly different the Germans are from us, how fundamentally their mentality and their ideals differ from ours.

To attain this object a new method is now given possessing various advantages over the methods that have been used so far. 2. The wood structure is subsequently described using decimal indices. Each of five sections of features are divided into four groups, and these again in subgroups, which have been worked out by means of indices. In the treatment of various features literature data are discussed.The classification of wood species aims at obtaining a grouping which, as far as possible, links up with the botanical groupings according to natural systems. 3. On the grounds given in the introduction and the discussion, the classification has been applied to features which can be perceived both with the unaided eye and a hand lens. The desirability and the possibility of classifying microscopic features in a similar way are dealt with briefly. 4. On the classification scheme an identification method is based employing loose cards. In this way, the number of woods included can be extended at will. Drawbacks attaching to the loose-card methods, used so far, have been obviated. 5. It is suggested that the decimal indexing of features should be normalized internationally.The authors should greatly appreciate to receive any remarks and suggestions that might improve and supplement the classification system described.Amsterdam/Delft, August 1944.

N2  - In a previous number of this volume (Blumea V, nr. 1, 1942, p. 66—80), one of the junior writers of the present paper published an account of nomenclatorial changes concerning javanese Verbenaceae. This paper was written as a supplement to a larger work by the senior writer, who has for long years devoted most of his activities to the study of the flora of Java, on which it was his privilege to publish some more or less extensive papers, all of them in the Dutch language 2). These publications may be considered materials for a Flora of Java. In fact, some of them have the character and even the title of such a flora, though on account of several circumstances none of them could be completed.Since the senior writer had retired from his official duties, an attempt was made to fill up this gap. For this purpose numerous scattered annotations were sorted and a start was made with the design of a reviewed and complete Flora of Java, again in Dutch. However, it soon became evident that this work was too extensive a task for a single man of my age and I therefore requested the help of the director of the Rijksherbarium at Leiden. Through his kind mediation the collaboration was procured of some junior assistants. In the first phase of the work financial support to this end was kindly granted, first by the “Maatschappij ter Bevordering van het Natuurkundig Onderzoek der Nederlandsche Koloniën” and afterwards also by the “Korthalsfonds”, managed by the Royal Netherlands’ Academy of Sciences at Amsterdam and by “Greshoff’s Rumphiusfonds”. Prof. Dr A. A. Pulle, Utrecht, kindly took an interest in this work and lent his intermediary in procuring the greater part of the necessary funds. In a later stage, however, also the Government could be convinced of the importance of this work and of a rapid rate of its progress and first one, later on two assistants were added to the Staff of the Rijksherbarium with the special instruction to assist me in my work. Recently a third assistant was appointed at the Botanical Museum and Herbarium of the Utrecht University. I take pleasure to avail myself of this opportunity to tender my best thanks to Dr Pulle and to Dr Lam for their kind collaboration, as well as to the Societies and Foundations, whose generous help in the earlier phases of the work appeared to be vital for starting it.

N2  - Prom a number of Ginkgo trees kernels were examined. The investigation of the variability of the material was greatly favoured by the large number of stones, in total about 4700. In addition, one tree, grown in the Botanic Garden at Leyden, supplied the material for an investigation of the variability of the female “flowers”, in total about 1700. 1. The number of female “flowers” or rather macrosporangiophores on the brachyblasts (short shoots) proved to be most variable, showing a correlation with the age of the shoot (Table I, fig. 1). 2. A subdivision of the macrosporangiophores into a series of types proved to be possible (Table II, fig. 2-3). 3. A certain relation between the shape of the macrosporangiophore and the shape of the leafy organs from whose axil it arises, was stated. Here again the age of the brachyblasts plays a part. It should be emphasized that the term “abnormality” is misleading. A great number of so-called abnormalities in the macrosporangiophores of Ginkgo prove to form part of a normal series of gradating variations (Table III, fig. 4). 4. There proved to be a relation between the shape of the seed and the shape of the kernels (fig. 5). Oblong seeds give long, pointed stones, while pear-shaped seeds contain club-shaped kernels. Furthermore very small seeds with normally shaped, but very small stones were found. Finally seeds are found in which the pollen-chamber is situated laterally instead of apically. In these seeds the stone is abnormal in shape, its sclerotesta mostly being incompletely lignified. 5. A further point of investigation was the length of the seed stalk (Table IV, fig. 6). This shows a considerable variation, the Leyden material possessing very short seeds stalks, while the Maastricht material had intermediate, that from Slikkerveer long stalks. 6. Finally the variation of the shape of the kernel was investigated. First of all a subdivision into stones with 1, 2, 3 or 4 ribs was made (Table V). The Leyden tree produced relatively many stones of the first group, but four-ribbed kernels are very rare, two- and three-ribbed ones being in the majority. The ratio two-ribbed stones: three-ribbed stones proved to be ± 3 (Table VI). It is probable that the material of Affourtit and La Rivière has been subject to some sort of selection, on account of which their results are not fully trustworthy. 7. There proved to be a strong variation in the angles between the ribs in two- and three-ribbed seed stones (Tables VII and VIII). In the two-ribbed kernels a tendency towards angles of 180° was stated (fig. 7), the most frequent shape being that of the kernel of a prune. 8. The graphic expression of the variability of three-ribbed stones presented some difficulties. To their solution Bakhuis Roozeboom’s triangle-method was chosen (figs 8-11). The most important result is the extreme rarity of regular seedstones with three angles of about 120° (Table IX). 9. It is certainly very remarkable that so ancient a plant as Ginkgo biloba shows such a variability in so many respects.

N2  - The degree of overlap between the Malesian and Nepalese floras was analyzed by comparison of the distributions of twenty plant families revised for Flora Malesiana. Despite their geographic separation in some plant families there is significant overlap between the two areas at both the generic and specific levels. In seven of these families at least 40 % of Nepalese species were also found in Malesia. In some families with temperate distributions up to 29 % of Malesian species and all Malesian genera are also found in Nepal. It is suggested that a coordinated approach to the production of accounts of such families would improve the rate of production of accounts and would greatly facilitate knowledge transfer and help to build scientific networks and expertise in Nepal.

N2  - The following notes are mainly based upon a small but interesting collection of plants, made in 1937—1939 by Mr C. Monod de Froideville, Civil Service Officer in the Netherlands Indies, during his extensive trips in the southern and central parts of the island of Celebes. His hobby was the study of Leguminosae and about half of his collection consists of representatives of that natural order. For several reasons, however, they have been left out of the present paper, for one thing since Mr Monod is intending to deal with them later on himself, a task, which circumstances unfortunately prevent him from accomplishing at present; and secondly since they promise geographically less important results than most other families, many of them being anthropochorous.However, beside Leguminosae, Mr Monod collected a good many other plants and though some of his material was necessarily scanty on account of the fact that the proper purpose of his trips lay outside purely botanical observations, it contains enough remarkable specimens, especially from the practically unknown interior of Central Celebes (Mt. Mamboeliling), to justify a record of them. Mr Monod has proved to be a keen observer and a thorough amateur botanist and geologist. Several of the specimens had been provisorily checked by Dr C. G. G. J. van Steenis, Buitenzorg, which was a great help in their final identification. Regarding this, it was my good fortune to win the help of several specialists in identifying specimens belonging to families falling within the scope of their special study. Thus I am indebted to the following investigators for their kind collaboration: Miss Dr G. J. H. Amshoff (Utrecht): Urticaceae. Dr R. C. Bakhuizen van den Brink (Leiden) : Melastomataceae. Dr C. E. B. Bremekamp (Bilthoven) : Acanthaceae, Rubiaceae. Dr J. Th. Henrard (Leiden) : Graminead. Dr F. P. Jonker (Utrecht) : Burmanniaceae. Miss Dr J. Th. Koster (Leiden) : Compositae. Dr S.

N2  - In one of his papers on Malaysian Orchids R. Schleehter (1911) expresses his surprise that the flora of Celebes, though promising so much from a phytogeographical point of view, is very little known in comparison with that of the Philippines and Java and even with that of Borneo. In 1926 E. D. Merrill repeated this assumption with little less emphasis, and it is, indeed, still holding good even nowadays. I am not able to tell the reason why Celebes has been so much neglected in this respect, though it has been given ample attention by zoogeographers.Yet, botanical exploration has been carried out ever since the French scientific world cruises of the “Astrolabe” (1828) and the “Astrolabe” and the “Zelee” (1839). The more important collections have been enumerated in the “Appendix” to the present paper and among these the most outstanding ones are those made by the Neth. – Indian Forestry Service and by such individual collectors as Forsten (1840, N), Zollinger (1847, SW and Salajar), Teysmann and De Vriese (1860, N), Teysmann (1877, SW and Salajar), Warburg (1888, SW), Koorders (1894—’95, N), P. and F. Sarasin (1893—’96 and 1902—’03, all parts), Elbert (1909, SE), Schleehter (1910, N), Van Vuuren (1912—’14, SW, C, SE), Docters van Leeuwen (1913, Salajar, etc.), Kaudern (1917—’20, SE, C, E, N), Bunnemeyer (1921, SW), Lam (1926, Talaud), Kjellberg (1929—’30, SW, SE), Eyma (1938, C, E) and Monod de Froideville (1937—’39, SW, C, SE).

N2  - Eighteen species of plants, most of which were chosen at random, were sown beside a hedge of Artemisia Absinthium; they were severely injured and in one ease ( Levisticum officinale) even killed by the chemical excretions of the latter within a distance of ± 100 cm; seedlings of Artemisia Absinthium, on the contrary, were not harmed by the plants in the hedge. The experiments were made during two successive summers and in different surroundings; the results were consistent and confirmed those of Bode, notwithstanding the fact that climatic conditions were extremely unfavourable for the excretion of absinthiin and that even during fine weather it appeared to be feeble owing to the sea climate of Leiden. Spells of cold and of heavy rains sometimes kept the excretion so low that temporarily the absinth plants seemed to exert no action at all.Seedlings which had survived the proximity of the absinth in their first year developed normally during the next season. It was demonstrated that the proximity of Atriplex hortensis had no influence on the same test plants which were injured by Artemisia Absinthium and that they were only physically oppressed by Artemisia vulgaris, viz. by its spreading, branches. This makes it probable that it is indeed the absinthiin, excreted by Artemisia Absinthium, which causes this species to be harmful to the surrounding plants.Fresh leaves of Artemisia Absinthium, dug in the soil, reduced the percentage of germination and sometimes also hindered the development of the seedlings of a number of species. Foliage of Artemisia vulgaris had sometimes a similar action, but seldom to the same degree. In the case of A. Absinthium two harmful effects are apparently combined: a too great amount of organic manure and the formation of absinthiin.It will be worth while to examine the ecological importance of Artemisia Absinthium in its natural habitat.

N2  - Tropical forests in Borneo (Brunei Darussalam, Kalimantan, Sabah and Sarawak) are considered as one of the twelve mega biodiversity centres in the world. However, until now, there is no up-to-date or complete documentation on the flora of the island. The Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak Project, jointly undertaken by the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM), the Forestry Department of Sabah and Forestry Department of Sarawak since 1991, is aimed at providing detailed and up-to-date botanical and ecological information on the tree resources of Sabah and Sarawak. Since its implementation, the project has established a close collaboration with and received generous help from botanists from local and international institutions/herbaria around the world. Up to 2007, a total of 1 745 species in 72 families and 267 genera have been revised and published in six volumes of the Tree Flora. These include the discovery and publication of 188 new species in 37 genera and 25 families. In addition, the project also published two Botanical Gazetteers, i.e. Sabah (1995) and Sarawak (2006) Gazetteers.Besides this, the project had carried out a number of activities such as botanical expeditions and various kinds of related workshops to achieve the objectives of the project.

N2  - Among the plants collected in the West-Indies by I. Boldingh during the years 1909 and 1910 there was a grass determined as Paspalum hemisphericum Poir., a name changed into glabrum. These determinations are incorrect because Paspalum hemisphericum Poiret is the same as the wellknown Paspalum paniculatum L. and also quite different from Poiret’s Paspalum glabrum, which, according to Mrs. A. Chase’s investigations, is the Paspalum laxum of Lamarck.Among Bolding’s plants there is a good specimen from the island of Bonaire, which, studied with Chase’s work on the North-American species of Paspalum, could not be identified. In Chase’s work also the species of Central-America and the West-Indian Islands are taken up, moreover the latter are also treated in Hitchcock’s posthumous work on the grasses of that region.

N2  - A collection of samples containing algae from the salines of Bonaire was brought home by Mr P. Wagenaar Hummelinck from his trips to the Netherlands West Indian Islands in 1930 and in 1936—1937. Though these trips were chiefly undertaken in order to gather zoological material (1, 2) 1), the collector paid attention to botanical objects as well, results of which are to be found in eight earlier papers (3—10).Several data concerning Bonaire can be learned from Mr Wagenaar Hummelinck’s publications. The island, having an area of about 265 km2, is chiefly composed of quaternary limestone (coralrocks), which forms a large plateau in the North East and the South. The Northwestern part of the island is much higher and more indented. Klein Bonaire, having an area of only 7 km2 and situated ¾ km West of Bonaire, consists of a low limestone plateau only.

As might have been expected this paper contains a number of incorrectnesses, which may largely be ascribed to an insufficient knowledge of this intricate and difficult family.

N2  - The first question in this field of science is: can we say, that there is actually any relation between taxonomy and chemistry of plants? Nearly a century ago the worker in chemistry Rochleder (10) attempted to show the possibility of this relation and called that branch of science phytochemistry.To begin with, something must be said about the products in question, Glucose, sucrose, several aminoacids and other acids are, of course, left out of account. Only those chemical products, which are more or less specific and characterise larger or smaller groups of plants are considered here.

N2  - An attempt has been made to subdivide a very polymorphous plant species by means of a quantitative statistical method. This method has been based upon the following working hypothesis: 1° as some morphological characters of the material, concerning e. g. the shape of the leaves, the length of the pedicels etc., show an extremely great variation, each of these characters in every specimen at hand may be stated to be in one of three (one intermediate and two extreme) conditions; 2° if a character happens to be in an intermediate condition in a relatively great number of specimens the difference between the extreme conditions of that character may be considered insignificant from a taxonomical point of view; 3° the fewer characters of two or more specimens are differing significantly (in the way mentioned), the more reason there is to consider those specimens to belong together; and, on the contrary, the more numerous the significant differences are, the more reason there is to distribute the specimens to two (or more) different groups. On the basis of this working hypothesis the material at hand, consisting of 143 specimens (all considered to belong to the Sapotaceous Planchonella sandwicensis, which was discussed in a paper by Lam), could be subdivided into two different groups. Five characters were chosen, each allowing to state one intermediate and two opposite extreme conditions. Of these the shape of the leaf proved to be a most important criterion for a subdivision. After this had been stated, a purely quantitative check was made which largely endorsed the result.

N2  - On preparing the manuscript of the Verbenaceae for Dr C. A. Backer’s ”Flora van Java” it appeared to me that — in comparison with the monographic treatments of this family by Lam (5) and by Lam  Bakhuizen van den Brink (6) — several changes in the nomenclature and in the interpretation or delimitation of certain species are urgent. Although, considered in the light of more recent work on this family as it occurs in adjacent regions (2, 3, 8), a new critical revision of the Malaysian Verbenaceae seems desirable, we have to refrain from such a task, which would require a greater deal of investigation than the present author is able to afford at the time. Hence these notes are merely intended to account for the discrepancies between the treatment of the javanese species as they will appear in the afore-mentioned flora and as they are given in the recent monographs (5, 6). Still, they may prove to be a first contribution towards another revision covering the whole of Malaysia.

N2  - Two approaches to revise large genera are discussed. The first approach can be done by a single person, who revises the genus area after area. The other approach is by a team that revises per infrageneric taxon (preferably a single person per infrageneric group). The two approaches have their positive and negative sides, but both give good results. One problem with both approaches is to keep an overview of a possible infrageneric classification. The latter problem can be tackled by performing phylogenetic analyses based on molecular markers (providing core phylogeny) in combination with morphological, palynological, and anatomical data (providing apomorphies for infrageneric taxa).

N2  - Summarizing, it appears that Eucommia has the greatest number of characters in common with the Urticales. This is shown by the similarity of the inflorescences as well as by the unisexual flowers and the dioecy. In both groups the pistil consists of 2 connate carpels and the ovary is usually 1-celled by abortion, while the stigmata are generally papillate. Further general points of relation with the Urticales are the originally spiral phyllotaxis, which becomes later on pseudo-distichous, simple vessel perforations, libriform with bordered pits, unicellular hairs and the occurrence of calciumcarbonate and silica as well as of latex elements.Yet, it seems difficult to indicate any particular family in the Urticales to which Eucommia should be most related. While the fruit recalls Ulmus and the latex elements Urtica and Cannabis, the spirally thickened vessel walls remind us of some Morus species. In addition, Eucommia is isolated by the facts that in the Urticales the perianth is never entirely wanting, that there is only one ovule in the cell of the ovary, that stipules are very frequent, that calciumoxalate is characteristic (it is wanting in Eucommia) and that the superficial suberization is subepidermal in the Urticales and epidermal in Eucommia.After the Urticales the Euphorbiaceae-Hippomaneae seem to be the nearest of kin, on account of a number of anatomical and morphological characters. However, the Euphorbiaceae usually possess a 3-celled ovary, a 2-celled one occasionally occurs in the Hippomaneae. Next follow the Hamamelidaceae which have, however, two fertile carpels but of which Distylium and Altingia show a reduction in the perianth and the latter moreover a similar leaf shape.

N2  - In 1938, Verdam published an account of the then-known Charophyta of the Netherlands in the English language (cf. this journal, vol. 3), and one year later (1939) another in our own language in “Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief”. In both papers reference was made to only five Netherlands’ publications on the same subject, the oldest of which is dating from 1846. In studying i.a. the history of the Malaysian Charophyta (Zaneveld, 1940) I found that much more was published on the Charophyta of our Low Countries. As will be seen below, it became evident that the first printed record of a Netherlands’ Charophyte dates as far back as 1636. It seems worth while to publish these notes on the history of the identification of our Charophyta as, moreover, a number of additional facts have become known.The data of the present review have been taken from the following sources (chronologically arranged): 1. herbals ; 2. catalogues of Botanic Gardens; 3. local floras; 4. general floras and taxonomic textbooks; 5. monographs.

N2  - In my first paper on Malaysian Convolvulaceae in Blumea III, 1938, p. 62—94, I pointed out (p. 83) that Neuropeltis racemosa Wall, has often been confounded both in literature and in herbaria with another species from the Malay Peninsula, N. Maingayi Peter. Moreover, on p. 85, I expressed my doubt whether specimens from Indo China, mentioned in literature as N. racemosa Wall, (by Gagnepain  Courchet in Lecomte, Flore Generale de l’Indo-Chine IV, 1915, p. 290, fig. 31) actually belong to that species. A more detailed study of materials from Indo China has now brought to light, that the plants from that country are different from those occurring in the Malay Peninsula and that they represent a new, though closely related, species.Specimens from the west coast of British India (Kanara, Malabar) also appeared to be different from N. racemosa, under which name they are mentioned by Beddome, Clarke, Cooke and Gamble.

N2  - During the preparation of an account of the grasses for the flora of Dutch Guiana many difficulties were found in the identification of species of the genus Axonopus. Our knowledge as to the most recent treatment is entirely based upon Doell’s work for the Flora Brasiliensis. It is, however, evident that Doell did not see many types and his concept of many species proves to be incorrect. The modern genus Axonopus is not accepted by Doell but treated by him as a section Emprosthion of the large genus Paspalum. The difficulties arose already when he treated Fluegge’s Paspalum furcatum which is a continental North American species. Raddi’s Paspalum obtusifolium from Brazil, although given as a synonym, is a quite distinct species. As another synonym is mentioned by Doell in Fl. Bras., Vol. II, pars II, p. 103: Panicum surinamense Hochstetter in Hostm. et Kappler, Plant. Surinam, n. 1283 with the addition: “spiculis ad margines, imprimis basi, magis pilosis”. The correct citation of Panicum surinamense Hochst. is, however, given by Steudel in his Synopsis, where the species is published. The type of Steudel was certainly not seen by Doell, but the valid publication of the year 1854 was mentioned by Doell under Paspalum scoparium Fluegge with the same number 1283 and the addition “partis nomine”. I observe here that the synonyms under Paspalum scoparium Fluegge in Doell’s treatment are for the greater part wrongly placed. It may be that Doell saw different plants of Hostmann and Kappler’s number 1283, but the type of Steudel corresponds to only one definite species, correctly described by him.From the description it is evident that Steudel’s plant is neither Paspalum furcatum nor Paspalum scoparium. To demonstrate this we have but to compare the description from the year 1854 which runs as follows: Panicum surinamense Hochst. (Hrbr. Dr. Hostmann nr. 1283) Erectum; culmo firmo valido elato (abscisso 3-pedali); vaginis longissimis basi cum nodis dense molliterque sursum ad vaginas tantum pilosis; foliis linearibus compressis (1’ longis in statu explanato 4—5’’’ latis) glabris carina scabriusculis; racemis elongatis (6—9’’) longis strictis fasciculatis (6—8); spiculis solitariis subsessilibus alternis subimbricatis lanceolatis glabris; gluma inferiore vix ulla (nisi apex explanatus pedicelli brevissimi), superiore 3-nervia flosculum aequante.

N2  - Evidemment la flore algologique du Golfe de Naples a été étudiée, d’assez près, tant du point de vue floristique que du point de vue écologique. Surtout FALKENBERG (1879), BERTHOLD (1882) et FUNK (1927) se sont occupés des investigations de cette nature. Il reste cependant un certain nombre de genres, qui demandent une étude plus approfondie. Un de ces genres est sans aucun doute Bryopsis pour laquelle il est difficile de limiter les espèces à cause de leur grande variabilité. Voici comment HAMEL (1930) se prononce sur ce genre: «D’ailleurs, les Bryopsis méditerranéens sont loin d’être connus; le peu que nous en savons est dû aux observations de J. Agardh; toute leur étude serait à reprendre sur le vivant.» FELDMANN (1937) y ajoute: «La classification des Bryopsis est encore bien confuse. La grande variabilité de ces algues et le peu de secours que peuvent fournir à l’étude les échantillons d’herbier rendent leur détermination très malaisée.» La Station zoologique à Naples, grâce à la table de travail néerlandaise, a fourni une belle occasion d’observer les Bryopsis vivants et dans leur habitats. L’étude de l’influence écologique des habitats a été rendue possible grâce à l’aide du pêcheur de la Station, rameur habile et guide parfait. Vu la variabilité des espèces il importe de collectionner une grande quantité d’individus pour étudier la limitation des espèces et pour reconnaître des formes comme unités taxonomiques. En outre, pour se faire une idée exacte des formes existantes il était nécessaire de visiter autant d’habitats que possible, sans négliger les habitats voisins. Les conditions écologiques ont été étudiées autant que possible sur les lieux mêmes. Finalement les épiphytes des Bryopsis ont été déterminés, les Diatomées exceptées. Les observations suivantes ont été faites dans le Golfe intérieur de Naples du 17 avril au 1er juin 1939 pendant des journées assez calmes et à marée basse. Malheureusement le mauvais temps à la fin du séjour a empêché l’étude du Golfe extérieur.

N2  - When revising the Visca of the Malay Archipelago and Indo-China, I met with some nomenclatorial difficulties, for which a more thorough study of the British-Indian Visca seemed necessary. The distinction of the species in HOOKER’S Flora soon appeared not to be depended upon. At the time of HOOKER’S revising the British-Indian Loranthaceae, only a scanty quantity of herbarium was available, and, the distinction between several species being extremely difficult, it is no wonder that HOOKER’S treatment of Viscum is no more up to date now. As appears from notes on herbarium sheets, GAMBLE later made a rather thorough study of the British-Indian Visca, which was only partly included in his Madras Flora, but he did not include the species of adjacent countries in his study. We now have a much larger quantity of herbarium materials at our disposal; several species described from outside British-India appeared to occur inside its frontiers, and new species had to be described from British India and China. Therefore a critical revision of all the Asiatic species seemed not to be superfluous. Moreover, the close relationship of the Australian Visca with Asiatic species made it desirable to include also the former in this revision. A revision of all the Asiatic, Malaysian, and Australian Visca would therefore have been the result, if not political circumstances had rendered it impossible to obtain the materials of several important Herbaria in the Tropics. I therefore preferred to close my study on the genus Viscum provisorily, and to publish it in the present form, in expectation of better times.The Herbaria upon which the present revision is based, mainly are those of Kew Gardens (K), and the Dehra Dun Forest Experiment Station (DD), the Viscum materials of which were kindly sent to me for examination. Many data, however, could be added from other Herbaria, such as those of Buitenzorg (B), Berlin-Dahlem (BD), the British Museum of Natural History (BM), Berkeley (UC), Brisbane (Bris), Edinburg (E), Geneva (G), Göteborg (Göt), Groningen (Gro), Honolulu (H), Leiden (L), Manila (M), Paris (P), Shillong (Sh), Singapore (S), and Vienna (V).

N2  - Korthalsella Dacrydii (RIDLEY) DANSER, the only species of its genus that is parasitic on Conifers, was, up to the present, only known from two mountains, viz., Mt. Tahan in the Malay Peninsula, and Mt. Gede in Java. For the latter mountain it was, for the first time, not discovered in the living state, but, by Dr VAN STEENIS, on herbarium specimens of Podocarpus imbricata, collected by KOORDERS and VAN DER HOEVEN in 1890. Later it was collected several times on Mt. Gede in the living state.While examining the materials of Podocarpus and Dacrydium of the Leiden, Buitenzorg, and Groningen Herbaria, I was so fortunate as to discover, in the same way as Dr VAN STEENIS did, several new localities of Korthalsella Dacrydii, and these not only in Java, but also in Sumatra, Borneo, and Timor. The localities now known are the following.

N2  - More than two years ago I published, in collaboration with W. W. VAROSSIEAU, a Revision of the Sarcospermataceae (Blumea 3, no. 1, 1938, 183—200), to which a small map was added, showing the areas of the 6 species known. Four of these have more or less continuous areas on the Continent of Asia, one is only known from a small area on Sumatra’s East Coast and one, taxonomically speaking the most isolated species, has a remarkably discontinuous area, the parts of which are widely spread over Malaysia. As was already mentioned in an additional note (Blumea 3, no. 2, 1939, 262), this species, Sarcosperma paniculatum, has also been collected in South-Celebes. Recently I came upon a specimen from New Guinea, collected by CLEMENS: 2. S. paniculata (KING) STAFF  KING. New Guinea: N.E. New Guinea, Morobe Dist., Sattelberg, 3300’ alt.: CLEMENS 1292, flow. on 20. 12. 1935. The small localities in which this species has been found are now known to be scattered over: the Malay Peninsula (Perak), Sumatra (East Coast opposite Perak), Borneo (Mt. Kinabalu), Mindanao (Mt. Apo), South-Celebes, Flores, Ternate, N.E. New Guinea (Sattelberg). The New Guinea specimen shows medium-sized inflorescences. I take this opportunity to quote some more specimens, examined by me in the collections of the British Museum, Natural History, during a short visit in May 1938: 3. S. arboreum HOOK. f. INDIA, Assam, Garo Hills, Tura, 4000’ alt.: C. B. CLARKE 43080 B, flow. 011 14.2.1886; Khasia, Nongpriang, 1000’ alt.: ID. 15022, buds on 21.11.1871. 6. S. Griffithii HOOK. f.

N2  - Lichens are fungi with a specialized nutritional mode involving algae, or cyanobacteria, or both.Classification is based on the fungal partner, and around 13 500 species are known. The association is ancient, and the first ascomycete fungi with fruit bodies may have been lichenized. Adaptations to tropical habitats include extensive utilization of trentepohlioid algae, the production of large multi-celled spores capable of forming numerous germ tubes, and water-repellant hydophobins coating internal cell walls. Many tropical groups lack modern monographs and numerous new species are discovered in detailed studies. Lichens merit more attention in the tropics as bioindicators of habitat disturbance.

N2  - When delimiting the area to be dealt with in this paper, it appeared, on the one hand, desirable to include some adjacent regions, such as the Malay Peninsula, North Borneo, Eastern New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands; on the other hand the war made it impossible to obtain herbarium materials from several Herbaria in Europe and the Tropics, and to elaborate the genus Podocarpus for the whole of Malaysia. Especially the Philippine Islands could not be taken into consideration, but the few materials I had the opportunity of examining have been included. I believe this treatment of the genus Podocarpus is rather complete for the Netherlands Indies proper.The specimens which I could examine in Groningen were lent by the Directors of the following Herbaria: (B) = the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Buitenzorg. (BD) = the Herbarium of the Botanical Museum, Berlin-Dahlem. (G) = the Herbarium of the University, Groningen. (L) = the National Herbarium (Rijksherbarium), Leiden. (Pa) = the Herbarium of the Sugar Experiment Station, Pasoeroean. (S) = the Herbarium of the Botanic Garden, Singapore. (U) = the Herbarium of the University, Utrecht.

The results of this work can by far not be considered to be complete, as the great lot of specimens collected in Java belonging to the genera under consideration are preserved in the “Herbarium van’s Lands Plantentuin te Buitenzorg”. Owing to the war these specimens were not available as yet. However, it may be useful to publish the novelties hitherto discovered.

N2  - In a former article 1) many new combinations and critical observations were published on various grasses all over the world. New investigations in critical genera together with the study of the existing literature made it necessary to accept various other arrangements in this important family. The old system of Bentham, once the basis for a total review, is now more and more modified and many tribes are purified and more exactly limited. The most recent system we have at the moment, is Hubbard’s treatment of this family in the work of Hutchinson: The families of flowering plants. Vol. II. Monocotyledons. The grasses are divided there into 26 tribes. We have here the great advantage that aberrant genera, which are not easy to place into one of the formerly accepted tribes, are given as representatives of distinct new tribes. The curious tropical genus Streptochaeta f.i. constitutes the tribe of the Streptochaeteae. It is quite acceptable that tribes may consist of but one genus, especially when such a genus is a totally deviating one and cannot be inserted into one of the already existing ones. Such tribes are f.i. the Nardeae with the only northern genus Nardus, and the Mediterranean tribe of the Lygeeae with the only genus Lygeum, one of the Esparto grasses. It is therefore no wonder that Hubbard creates a new tribe, the Anomochloeae, for one of the most curious tropical grasses of the world. This tribe is represented by only one species, the Anomochloa marantoidea Brongn., with a very curious habit and no evident affinities with any other grass. The same can be said of the aberrant genus Pariana, the only member of the tribe of the Parianeae. The most valuable advance is the creation by Hubbard of the tribe of the Thysanolaeneae with as the only member our well-known tropical and subtropical East-Asiatic genus Thysanolaena.Although this new subdivision of the family of the grasses gives us a great satisfaction, it does not mean that the system is complete and certainly many changes are to be given before we will have a totally correct and acceptable classification of the grasses.

DE WILDEMAN. These papers intend to give a mere enumeration of all Charophyta published up to 1896, and therefore mainly contain the species recorded by the famous Charaphytologists ALEX. BRAUN and OTTO NORDSTEDT in 1849, 1882, 1888 and 1889.In the twentieth century only three papers were published on the Charophyta of this area, viz. that by DE WILDEMAN (1900), that by GUTWINSKY (1902), and that by FILARSZKY (1934). The first-named author worked up the specimens occurring in Java, the second one adds two species to this list, whereas the latter studied materials collected in 1928 and 1929 by the German Limnological Sunda Expedition.

LüTJEHARMS, who stayed there from the end of May to the beginning of July collecting materials for the Herbaria at Buitenzorg and Leiden. During this excursion he also collected some zoocecidia, which were sent to me for classification by the Director of the Rijksherbarium, Leiden.The collection consists of 16 galls on various plants; many of them were already known as occurring in other parts of the Malay Archipelago; others are new, these are marked with an asterisk. A collection of 16 galls is actually to small to give insight into the wealth of galls of this tropical island; so far, however, nothing was known about the galls of the island, and since it is unlikely that the place will before long again be examined as to its galls, I deemed it worthwile to describe this small collection.

N2  - For the incorporation of various grasses in the herbaria of our institutes, we are constantly looking for the correct names to accept, according to the priority. The study of the existing names, as they are given in the Index Kewensis, is therefore indispensable. Working in various genera of the grasses we find, however, that many names are not tenable, because they were accepted without studying the whole literature of the subject. It appeared that, various names are omitted in the Index Kewensis, and indications given in various papers are sometimes neglected.Thus, the well-known and characteristic Aristida rhiniochloa HOCHST., already described in the year 1855 and treated by me in the Critical Revision (p. 510) and in my Monograph, is not yet given in the Index, although many of my new species are mentioned.

N2  - The gradual loss in traditional knowledge on wild edible fungi is a common phenomenon the world over, including Malaysia. A documentation of known edible fungi in Malaysia was executed, with the objective of salvaging traditional knowledge on the identification and edibility of these mushrooms, particularly from her village communities.Among those that have been successfully documented in this study were Cookeina and Galiella of the class Ascomycetes and Termitomyces, Schizophyllum, Hygrocybe, Lentinus, Calvatia, Calostoma and Auricularia, from the Basidiomycetes which make up a total of 13 or 14 species belonging to 9 genera. It is hoped that this documentation will contribute towards an updated scientific identification, including their genetic sequences in the near future.

Uitgave van (Fern flora for Java. Conspectus of the ferns and fern allies occurring in Java, their distribution, ecology and use. Issued by) ’s Lands Plantentuin, Buitenzorg, June 1939. I—XLVII, 1—370, 1 Plate, 1 map and 81 text figures. — ƒ 7.50.The users both at home and abroad of Dr. BACKER’s florae have always regretted that, however carefully these books have been prepared, most of them were imperfect in one way or another. They were either restricted to certain vegetations (weedflorae for tea and sugar-cane) or did not cover all groups of vascular plants; the ”Flora van Batavia“ (1907), the ”Schoolflora voor Java“ (1911) contain only the Dicotyledoneae-Dialypetalae, the ”Handboek voor de flora van Java“ (1928) contains scattered families of the Ferns and Fern Allies, Gymnosperms and many Monocotyledons. This phenomenon is probably due to the fact that BACKER is a most accurate and painstaking worker, who is inclined to refrain from publication unless he is reasonably sure to be correct; and we all know how difficult it is to reach a mental state of this description. However, BACKER has for some years been engaged in preparing with untiring and admirable energy, a new and complete ”Schoolflora voor Java“, the manuscript of which is rapidly growing to maturity. When the Pteridophytes were completed as far as the regions up to 3300’ were concerned, Dr. POSTHUMUS suggested a collaboration in order to make a complete flora of vascular cryptogams. This collaboration of our keenest connoisseur of the Java flora and our best pteridologist resulted in the book, which we have the pleasure to announce and recommend here. Together with the new. ”Schoolflora“ to which we may be looking forward soon, it will form the first reliable flora of the vascular plants of Java. Although the Dutch language is probably less unapproachable than the Russian one, with which Soviet botanists try to convince the world that everybody should know Russian (or that it is not necessary that other peoples should know Russian botany?), it is, I think, to be regretted that our mother tongue has been chosen for a book which many foreign botanists, notably in British Malaya and British Borneo, may desire to use. This is the more so, as the book does not only contain keys to the determination and descriptions of the 15 families, 104 genera and 515 species, but also interesting chapters on the distribution (with map), the ecology, the sociology and the use of the plants described. Also the introductory paragraphs (pp. XIII—XXX) contain many valuable and interesting notes on the morphology; the wording of these chapters is probably not easy for those who are only little familiar with our language, as BACKER has a certain predilection for a literary style.

N2  - The actual dates of publication of the greater part of BLUME’s Flora Javae (lit. 1) appear to be unknown among taxonomists. The title-page of the first volume is dated 1828, and we find the same year at the base of the preface. The volume containing the Orchideae (lit. 2) is dated 1858, but further dates are absent on the work. A cover for a fascicle containing the ”Planches inedites“ in the Groningen University Library is dated 1829, and there are indications that no such cover ever bore a later date. Therefore, perhaps, one often finds 1828, or 1828?, or 1829 as the year of publication of the whole first series. My investigations concerning the actual dates of publication have not yet given me all the information I wished to have, but the main points seem to be now known, and to be worth publication.In tracing literature on this subject I was considerably helped by Messrs. Dr S. BLOEMBERGEN, then in Groningen, WILLIAM T. STEARN, London, and Dr C. G. G. J. VAN STEENIS, Buitenzorg. I wish to express my best thanks to these gentlemen for the kind assistance which they gave to me.

N2  - On several occasions the author received specimens for determination under the name of Loranthaceae, which in reality appeared to be Phacellarias, usually parasitic on Loranthaceae. When trying to name these Phacellarias, he preceived how difficult it was to survey the literature of the genus. Though only eight species have been described, and the authors usually have indicated the main differences between their new species and the most closely allied previous ones, the most essential characteristics of the species, viz., the structures of the inflorescences, were never indicated, and a critical review of all the species has never been given. Therefore it appeared an attractive task to undertake such a revision, if only it were possible to examine all the type specimens. Through the kindness of the Directors and Keepers of the Kew and Edinburgh Botanic Gardens (K, E) and of the Paris Natural History Museum (P), the author was actually allowed to do this. Moreover he had the opportunity to study specimens of the Herbarium of the British Museum of Natural History in London (BM) and the Buitenzorg Botanic Gardens (B), whereas he discovered one specimen in Mr. A. F. G. KERR’s private herbarium. The author expresses his sincere thanks to all the gentlemen who made this revision possible.

N2  - In Blumea, Vol. II, 1937, pp. 239 to 277, appeared an article bearing the above title. It is a description of an excursion to the Salajar Islands, situated south of Celebes; lists of the plants found in the islands are appended. Prof. Dr C. E. B. BREMEKAMP wrote to me that in the Leiden Herbarium a small collection of plants, collected by me in the Salajar Islands, and long ago lent to the late Dr TH. VALETON, have been found. This collection contained, apart from the Rubiaceae, the special subject of Dr VALETON, some representatives of other plant families. Prof. BREMEKAMP sent me a list of names of these plants, for which I tender him my cordial thanks. Besides he communicated to me that a few plants are mentioned under wrong names in the original publication.They are: nr. 86 of Djampea is not Ophiorrhiza neglecta BL., but O. parviflora REINW. Besides the number mentioned, 1573, two other specimens of this plant were collected in the same island, nr. 1618 and nr. 1633, both at an altitude of 200 m.

N2  - The flora of the island of Java belongs, especially as to the family of the grasses, to the best explored ones. It was JUNGHUHN, who collected them extensively and his material was the basis of a fine enumeration by our countryman BUSE, in the year 1854. In modern times the grass flora of the island was thoroughly studied by Dr C. A. BACKER, who prepared not only very rich collections, but being familiar with the system of the Gramineae, gave in his ”Flora van Java“ a detailed study of this family with excellent descriptions and many very important data.Unfortunately his species-concept and his nomenclature is not always up to date and it is to be hoped that a new modern Flora of Java can be prepared on the basis of the very important and rich material now at hand.

N2  - In 1919 Dr C. A. BACKER collected a plant in the Kangean Archipelago which had the appearance of a Cymaria so that the collector provisionally called it ”Cymaria triphylla BACKER“ (MS.). The same species was also collected by KARTA on the Island of Bawean in 1928. Some other sheets already extant in the Herbarium at Buitenzorg for a long time among the indeterminate specimens were recognized as identical with this ”Cymaria“ (TEYSMANN nr. 1750, Madoera and nr. 1768, Bawean). In 1937 Dr BACKER, when working up Javanese plants, had a closer examination of this plant and concluded that it could not be inserted in Cymaria, and even not in the Labiatae, but that it had rather to be put into the Verbenaceae. However, he found himself unable to identify the species with the monograph of the Malaysian Verbenaceae (H. J. LAM, The Verbenaceae of the Malayan Archipelago, etc., Groningen 1919), nor in the revision of that family (H. J. LAM  R. C. BAKHUIZEN VAN DEN BRINK, Bull. du Jard. bot. de Buitenz., III, 3, 1921). He therefore kindly put the specimens into our hands for closer examination. Moreover, a part of the alcohol material preserved at Buitenzorg was kindly put at our disposal. The material appeared to represent a hitherto undescribed species of Vitex. We are indebted to Dr BACKER and to Dr D. F. VAN SLOOTEN, Keeper of the Buitenzorg Herbarium, for their kind assistance and their allowance to publish our results in this Journal.Vitex cymarioides H. J. LAM et A. D. J.

Genus VII, Erycibe, belonging to the Erycibeae shall be treated afterwards in a special monograph.With regard to the geographic arrangement of the specimens mentioned, some alterations had to be introduced due to the new limitation of the residencies in the island of Java. The names and limits of these residencies are now brought into line with the data of the ”Atlas van Tropisch Nederland“ ²).

N2  - Our knowledge of the Charophyta of Madagascar is mainly based on the rich and well-prepared collection made by Mr TH. B. BLOW, who visited the eastern central part of the island in the early months of 1924 ¹). The 384 dried specimens and a considerable number of portions of the plants preserved in formalin were determined by the well-known authority on the Charophyta, the late JAMES GROVES, who published the results of his work in the Journal of the Linnean Society (Botany), vol. XLVIII, 1928. This paper contains the descriptions of 5 new species and 3 new varieties of Nitella.Before this basic paper on the Charophyta of Madagascar was published, only very few publications appeared. As far as I know the first Madagascarian species to be recognized was ”Chara ceylonica WILLD.“, described by BOJER in the ”Hortus Mauritianus“ (1837, p. 427). The specimen was not seen by BRAUN, but he placed it in his large species C. gymnopus as subspecies C. Commersonii (1868, p. 872). BRAUN also states in the same work (l.c., p. 785) that he saw another specimen from Madagascar collected by GOUDOT, but did not mention it elsewhere in ”Die Characeen Afrika’s“, nor has he cited the two specimens in his ”Fragmente zu einer Monographic der Characeen“ (1882). Though the latter work forms the starting point for the study of the Charophyta of almost every country all over the world, the name Madagascar is not to be found in it.

N2  - This is the first contribution to a series of papers dealing with the Convolvulaceae of Malaysia (Malay Peninsula and Archipelago, Philippines and New Guinea). As far as possible the contributions will be published in accordance with the systematical arrangement of the genera. For a survey on this arrangement I refer to HAULIER'S fundamental work on this matter published in 1893 in the 16th volume of ENOLER'S Botanische Jahrbücher, entitled: ”Versuch einer natürlichen Gliederung der Convolvulaceen auf morphologischer und anatomischer Grundlage“. After all genera will have been published, a determination key will be added, based on the genera of the area under consideration, in which I hope to take especially account of the characters of the Malaysian species. Meanwhile the key published by HAULIER in the above mentioned paper can be provisionally used.On account of the structure of the pollen grains the Convolvulaceae as a whole can be subdivided, as has been proposed by HAULIER, into two groups, viz. the Psiloconiae with smooth pollen grains and the Echinoconiae with spinose ones. The former of these groups contains seven tribes, viz. 1. Cuscuteae, 2. Wilsonieae (not in Malaysia), 3. Dichondreae, 4. Dicranostyleae, 5. Poraneae, 6. Erycibeae and 7. Convolvuleae. Of the six genera worked out here, Cuscuta belongs to the Cuscuteae, Dichondra to the Dichondreae, Evolvulus, Bonamia and Neuropeltis to the Dicranostyleae and Porana to the Poraneae. For the limitation and description of the tribes see HALLIER l.c. and in ENGLER’S Botanische Jahrbücher, Vol. XVIII, 1894, p. 92, under Prevostea.

N2  - During the year 1936 the first of us made a trip to the island of Enggano (W. coast of Sumatra, Residency of Benkoelen) for the special purpose of collecting Cryptogams. During this trip also a number of Phanerogams could he gathered. The collections made are preserved at the Rijksherbarium at Leiden, duplicates are to be found in the Herbarium at Buitenzorg. The Phanerogams were preliminary identified by Dr. D. F. VAN SLOOTEN Leguminosae, Flacourtiaceae, Combretaceae, Gramineae) and by Dr. C. G. G. J. VAN STEENIS). Afterwards some additional determinations were made by several specialists (BREMEKAMP, HENRARD, JONKER, Miss KOSTER, LAM, J.J. SMITH, UITTIEN) and by the authors. It resulted that a few species proved to be hitherto undescribed. Two of them will be published below, together with two others met with in the collections of the Rijksherbarium during our investigations. Some others will be published elsewhere in this periodical.

Eleven pollen types were recognized, of which seven were previously reported and four are newly described, i.e., the Phyllanthus erythrotrichus type, the P. glochidioides type, the P. securinegoides type and the Pilate type. The pollen morphology of the Philippine Phyllanthus species included in this study provides insight into the taxonomy as well as the phylogeny of these species.

N2  - Taxonomy is static, its symbols are therefore two-dimensional, representing 1. differences or resemblances and 2. diversity (eventually are also area). Phylogeny is dynamic and its symbols are three-dimensional, representing 1. Time, 2. differences or resemblances and 3. diversity (eventually also migration). The term ”genorheithrum“ is proposed for a ”stream of potentialities“ as a phylogenetic unit in the Time. Taxonomic units are cross-sections through genorheithra, the boundaries of which are discontinuities of various kinds. A new discontinuity originates, as a rule, from a great number of potentialities (not from a single [pair of] parents). This implies the probability of polytopy as a common phenomenon, and also the supposition of a minimum of genetic property, below which a discontinuity is not viable. Natural extinction may be largely due to the loss of potentialities. — Corresponding reasonings may be applied to Biogeography, which may be static (floristics and faunistics) or dynamic (migrations). Taxonomic units are represented here by areas, the rate of extension of which may be a function of the number of potentialities. The forces, influencing the motion of any point of an area boundary are briefly summarized in a table, demonstrating tho embarrassing complexity of WILLIS’ statistical methods. In addition, the ”law of BEYERINCK“ is formulated anew on a broader basis. Disappearing of areas may be due to two causes: extinction of the units (loss of potentialities), or dissolution into new units (areas). The minimum of potentialities mentioned finds a geographic analogon in the law of the minimum area, established by PALMGREN.

N2  - The Burseraceae comprise 3 tribes which show an increasing differentiation from West to East and have, accordingly, their points of gravity in America ( Protieae), Africa (Bursereae) and Asia to Australia-Polynesia (Canarieae) respectively. An eastward migration of the order is probable. The easternmost tribe comprises 5 genera, viz. Scutinanthe, Canarium, Santiria, Dacryodes and Haplolobus. These are tested regarding their fundamental characters, in order to calculate their ”phase indices“. In these calculations 1 (of the series 1, 1½, 2, 2½, 3) means the most primitive, 3 the most advanced condition of a feature. From the figures thus obtained and from geographical data, it is concluded that Haplolobus (area: Borneo to New Guinea inclusive; map 1) is the youngest genus of the five, whilst the four others must have originated in East Asia more or less simultaneously from the ”Procanarieae“ which where at that time still closely related to the ancestors of Garuga (Protieae). It is further evidenced both by the characters and by area disjunction that Haplolobus must have originated bi- or polytopically from Santiria in Eastern Malaysia. Santiria shows a recent species explosion in the Sunda Land, Haplolobus in New Guinea (map 2). In ”Wallacea“ the last-named genera are apparently either in regression (Santiria) or scantily developing (Haplolobus).The paper proceeds with considerations on migration tracks in Malaysia and adjacent regions (map 3), checked by a short survey of the geological history since the early Tertiary. From the last-named survey it is concluded that three different areas are in the way of genorheithra, migrating either eastward or westward in Malaysia, viz. 1. the old and large continental Sunda Land which enabled rapid migrations and large ”species explosions“; 2. ”Wallacea“ which with its continuous insular character has always been a serious impediment to migrations and which consequently is to be considered as a sieve for potentialities; and 3. the Sahul Land which is also continental, but younger and smaller than the Sunda Land. These conditions (among others) are responsible for the fact that so much more Asiatic types have reached Australia and Polynesia than Australian types reached Asia. The paper closes with a tentative reconstruction of the tertiary and quaternary phylogeny of the Canarieae in the region under discussion (fig. 1).

N2  - Years ago I intensively studied the grasses of the tribe of the Maydeae. The results of my investigations were published in an article ”A contribution to the knowledge of the Indian Maydeae“, issued in the ”Mededeelingen van ’s Rijks Herbarium“ no. 67 (1931). In this paper the grasses of this tribe from the Old World were treated and especially the various genera were characterized according to their caryopses. The curious form and the place of the hilum of the caryopsis were accepted as characters of high importance to distinguish and to establish the various genera, and it was especially the genus Polytoca, which was more sharply defined by the place of the hilum, the lower margins of the grain enclosing a cavity at the bottom of which is found the hilum. In the genus Chionachne such a cavity is not present and the hilum is found at the back of the grain. I accepted 4 species of the genus Chionachne. One of them, viz. Ch. Koenigii (SPRENGEL) THWAITES, is rather widely distributed from British India and Ceylon to Tonkin and from Celebes to Queensland.Ch. biaurita HACKEL is endemic in the Philippines and Ch. semiteres (BENTH.) HENR. was only observed in the Deccan Peninsula and Burma. The fourth species was mentioned by me from Queensland as being Chionachne Sclerachne BAILEY. The type of BAILEY was not represented in the Kew Herbarium and I saw only a fragment from a plant collected by F. v. MUELLER, which I accepted as being BAILEY’s species. DOMIN mentioned from Queensland only Polytoca cyathopoda (F. v. M.) BAILEY and not having seen DOMIN’s plant I had only to accept that the identification was correct. Recently Mr. HUBBARD from the Kew Herbarium could examine DOMIN’s plant and found that it belonged to the genus Chionachne.

N2  - ROXBURGH described in his Flora in the year 1820 a very curious annual grass and placed it in the genus Eleusine as E. verticillata ROXB.. This grass has spikelets which agree in many characters with those of the genus Eleusine, especially as to the rugose grain with a caducous pericarp, but differing from Eleusine in the up to 20-flowered spikelets and in the lemmas with a three-cuspidate summit. The many-flowered spikelets give the plant more the habit of an Eragrostis and under this genus a specimen was mentioned by WALLICH in his Catalogue. There are in the characters of the spikelets many other differences with the genus Eleusine and with Eragrostis. KUNTH and STEUDEL, indeed placed the plant under Leptochloa and there are still other opinions about this plant.An advancement in this matter was the opinion of LINDLEY, who published in the year 1836 a new genus Acrachne WIGHT et ARN., in the second edition of his ”Natural System of Botany“, p. 381, based upon ROXBURGH’s Eleusine verticillata, The name Acrachne was already given by WIGHT et ARNOTT as Acrachne eleusinoides, a nomen in WIGHT, Cat. no. 1760. This name was placed by STEUDEL in the year 1854 under E. verticillata ROXB., a name also accepted by NEES. The name Acrachne, although based upon a species which was validly published, was, however, not described by LINDLEY and the combination A. verticillata was not made by LINDLEY. At that time the genus Acrachne was therefore not valid.

N2  - Among the grasses, preserved at the Rijksherbarium, one of the most valuable collections is certainly that of the well-known agrostologist and collector, B. BALANSA. It contains not only the types of the grasses, described by himself, but also very beautiful material, received by him from his contemporaries. All his European and Oriental grasses, those collected by him in New Caledonia, Tonkin and Java, besides a rich material from his travels in Paraguay and Argentina, are represented in this collection together with a beautiful set of ARECHAVALETA’s grasses form Uruguay. The material is in extraordinarily good condition and was very completely collected by him. I could already describe many novelties from this collection. One of these is particularly interesting on account of questions of geographical distribution.Various botanists have called attention to the fact that there is a rather striking concurrence in the floras of Argentina and some of the southern States of North America and it was STANDLEY who pointed this out, giving a list of analogous species from both countries. It is true that in some cases grasses of the southern States of North America occur in Argentina too. I have already had the opportunity to emphasize this, but generally speaking the coincidence of grasses of both parts of the earth mentioned here, is not so very large if we study the plants more intensively. What I mean is this: in many cases and at first sight, or studying the principal features, a resemblance is very striking, especially also as to the habit and the more prominent characters. But on comparing such plants from North America with the corresponding plants from Argentina, it appears in most of the cases that the two species are not identical. Argentina species of the so very difficult genus of Setaria certainly closely resemble some species from Mexico or the southern Unites States, but in my opinion, they do not belong to the same species. It was especially the genus Aristida which, after an exhaustive study, gave me a better idea of these so-called ”succedaneous“ species. As, however, such Argentina species of Aristida differed in a great many minor points from the North American representatives of this group, it was impossible to consider them as really identical and I was so convinced of their specific distinction that I did not hesitate to accept them as new species. It is not difficult to find in other genera of grasses similar convergencies which, in reality, do not exist. Resemblance is only relating to the general habit and the external or easily visible characters, but a great many minor, but very constant and not less striking characters are to be found, through which we are justified to consider them as different species.

N2  - The genus Sarcosperma was excluded from the Sapotaceae by the first-named writer in 1925, the group being considered as of family rank. In 1926 the same author published a concise and fragmentary revision of the monotypic order, in which two new Malaysian species were described. The continental species, however, were merely quoted from literature. To this a key was added.As since then more material has been collected, it seemed desirable to give a new revision of this small but interesting order. For this purpose materials have, at our request, kindly been sent on loan to the Rijksherbarium (L) ¹) from the following institutions: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew — K. Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum, Berlin — B. Musee d’Histoire Naturelle, Phanérogamie, Paris — P. Botanical Garden, New York — NY. U.S. National Museum, Division of Plants, Washington — W.

N2  - Referring to the identification of BRASS 5219 from Papua as a representative of the Verbenaceous Faradaya chrysoclada K. SCHUM. by E. BEER and H. J. LAM (Blumea 2, 1936, 225), Dr C. G. G. J. VAN STEENIS, the monographer of the Malaysian Bignoniaceae drew our attention to the possibility that this identification might be incorrect. It was suggested that the specimen and also all specimens hitherto known as Faradaya chrysoclada might be Bignoniaceous and might belong to Deplanchea tetraphylla (R. BR.) V. STEENIS, as all other Faradayas known are lianas, whereas F. chrysoclada was reported to possess the tree habit, as the Deplancheas.We therefore asked on loan the materials of both species from the Herbarea at Berlin (B) and Kew (K), that from Berlin including the type specimen of Faradaya chrysoclada. Our thanks are due to the directors of the Herbaria of Berlin and Kew for kindly lending us the material desired.

N2  - Phytochemical characters of the plants that have been treated as Disporum luzoniense (Merrill  Merritt 1910) or Disporopsis fuscopicta (Jessop 1979) in the Philippines were compared with those of Disporum kawakamii and Disporopsis fuscopicta in Taiwan. The present phytochemical study revealed that Disporum kawakamii had luteolin, apigenin and chrysoeriol as free state, while these flavonoids were not detected in the Philippine plant and Disporopsis fuscopicta from Taiwan. Moreover, flavone O-glycosides were isolated from Disporum kawakamii, while flavone C-glycoside was isolated from the Philippine plant and Disporopsis fuscopicta from Taiwan. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the Philippine plant is chemotaxonomically related to Disporopsis and this agrees with the taxonomic treatment of Jessop (1979).

N2  - The Salajar Islands strew the Flores Sea between Celebes and Flores. The group consists of no less than 73 smaller and larger islands. The principal islands are: Salajar or Tanadoang, Djampea, Kalao, Kalaotoa, and Bonerate. A number of smaller islands form together the group of the so-called Tiger Islands, and to the south of them arc the very small, low Pasitaloe Islands. The Salajar group is situated between Long. 119°50’ E. and 121°30’ E. and between Lat. 5°36’ S. and 7°25’ S. See the map on p. 240.In May 1913, I was enabled to visit this territory, thanks to a financial allowance of the „Maatschappij ter bevordering van het Natuurkundig Onderzoek der Nederlandsche Kolonien” (Society for the Promotion of the Scientific Investigation of the Netherlands Colonies), for short: „Treub Society”, and also of the „Provinciaal Utrechtsch Genootschap voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen” (Utrecht Provincial Society for Arts and Sciences). The publication of the present paper was enabled by financial support of the „Leidsch Universiteitsfonds” (Leiden University Fund). I beg to tender my best thanks for all this valuable support here.

N2  - Im 3. Heft des Jahrganges 1936 der Oesterreichischen Botanischen Zeitschrift veröffentlichte ich einen Aufsatz über „Klimacharakter und Pflanzendecke” (14), in dem ich einen formelmässigen Ausdruck für die Ozeanität des Klimas aufzustellen versuchte. Ich nannte diesen Wert „0zeanitätsindex” und bestimmte ihn aus der Formel n.½(ƒa-ƒi) (t + 20). √ta-ti wobei n die Niederschlagssumme des Jahres in cm, ƒa das Maximum und ƒi das Minimum der relativen Luchtfeuchtigkeit, t die Jahresmitteltemperatur in Celsiusgraden und ta das Mittel des wärmsten, ti das Temperaturmittel des kältesten Monats bedeuten. Bei der kartographischen Darstellung der Ozeanität mit Hilfe dieses Wertes zeigte sich eine weitgehende Uebereinstimmung mit den grossen klimabedingten Formationen bzw. Unterformationen, die ich auch am Schlüsse der Arbeit tabellarisch zusammenfasste (14, Seite 211/212).Auf Grund dieser Skizze wandte sich im Herbst 1936 Herr Prof. Dr. H. J. LAM, Direktor des Rijksherbariums in Leiden, an mich mit der Anfrage, ob ich auf Grund ausführlicherer Daten, als mir bisher solche zur Verfügung standen, für Niederländisch-Indien die Ozeanitätsverteilung genauer bestimmen wolle; auf meine bejahende Antwort hin übermittelte mir Herr Direktor Dr. H. J. LAM im Wege des Botanischen Institutes zu Wien die meteorologischen Daten (1,9,21), die ich dann noch aus der Bibliothek der Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik in Wien ergänzen konnte (2, 3, 11, 12). Dabei ergab sich auch die Möglichkeit, auf Australien Rücksicht zu nehmen, so dass ich dieses samt Neuseeland neuerlich in die Untersuchung miteinbezog; dazu wurde ich auch durch die Uebersendung einer ganz neuen Studie über die Vegetationsverhältnisse Australiens (19) bewogen, die mir Herr WILLIAM HARTLEY, Assistent am Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Division of Plant Industry, Canberra, übermittelte. Bevor ich an die Besprechung des Themas schreite, möchte ich auch hierorts allen jenen Stellen danken, die mich unterstützt haben, vor allem Herrn Direktor Dr. H. J. LAM (Leiden), Herrn Direktor Dr. F. KNOLL und Prof. Dr. B. SCHUSSNIG (Botanisches Institut Wien), Herrn W. HARTLEY (Canberra), Dr. F. STEINHAUSER (Zentralanstalt f.

N2  - In conclusion, we propose the following nomenclatural alterations. For a good classification, the genus Vulpia is to be accepted as a member of the Festuceae. Various names of Vulpia are fixed according to our present rules of nomenclature, viz. V. bromoides (L.) GRAY, V. membranacea (L.) LINK, V. geniculata (L.) LINK, V. stipoides (L.) DUM. and V. Myurus (L.) GMELIN. For Vulpia ciliata the earliest valid epithet is taken and so this widely distributed species must bear the name of V. aetnensis TINEO, while its glabrous variety is named imberbis (Vis.) HENR.. Vulpia delicatula (LAG.) DUM. var. hirsuta HENR. and Vulpia geniculata (L.) LINK var. dasyantha HENR. are described as new varieties. Among the South American species the new combinations Vulpia eriolepis (DESV.) HENR., Vulpia australis (NEES) HENR. and Vulpia muralis (KUNTH) HENR. are proposed, moreover the endemic Vulpia Teneriffae (ROTH) HENR. is mentioned. The North American species are treated in connection with the parallel variations of the European Vulpias and the following new combinations are given, viz. Vulpia octoflora (PIPER) RYDBERG, var. hirtella (PIPER) HENR., V. sciurea (NUTT.) HENR., V. arida (ELMER) HENR., V. confusa (PIPER) HENR., V. Eastwoodae (PIPER) HENR., V. Grayi (ABRAMS) HENR. and V.

N2  - Many plants are as a whole or in some characteristic features flabelliform. So it is easy to understand that botanists often used the word piпio or piпidiov as a component of plant names. It is rather astonishing, however, that this word, R(h)ipidion or R(h)ipidium occurs no less than five times as a generic name (including one nomen nudum). In the list of homonyms by Miss M. L. GREEN C.S. (Kew Bull. misc. Inf., 1935, p. 341—544) the word is not mentioned, though it is of importance for mycologists. It may seem curious that also OTTO KUNTZE, who was very keen on such cases, probably overlooked it. Only in the list of nomina conservanda (auct. R. MAIRE; Int. Rules Nomencl., Ed. III, 1935, p. 124) one of the cases was considered¹).Rhipidium CORNU, Bull. Soc. bot. Fr., 18, 1871, p. 58; Ann. Sci. nat. Bot., V, 15, 1872, p. 15. (Saprolegniaceae).

N2  - Any community of plants is characterized in four main ways — by a definite floristic composition, by definite life-forms, by a definite structure and by a definite habitat or environment.Of these four characters, floristic composition is the most important in defining a plant community in any particular locality. It is a commonplace fact that many parts of the world may show communities of higher plants identical in life-form, structure and habitat but differing widely in their floristic composition. By utilising the three last named characters of a plant community we can group our unit biocoenoses into larger groups.

N2  - Unter allen Flechten unterscheidet sieh die nur aus Norwegen bekannte Gattung Moriola dadurch, dass ihr Lager aus Goniocysten besteht, das sind kugel- oder länglichrunde oder unregelmässig gestaltete braune Behälter mit netzartiger Oberfläche, von denen braune, zylindrische oder schwach torulöse Hyphen entspringen und bis zur nächsten, manchmal weit entfernten Goniocyste hinkriechen. Auf diesem Wege, auch wenn sie zu mehreren nebeneinander herlaufen, vereinigen sie sich nie zu einer strauch-, oder blatt-, nicht einmal zu einer krustenformigen Lagermasse. Diese besteht ausschliesslich aus zerstreuten Goniocysten und den sie verbindenden Hyphen, die bei Moriola pseudomyces (Fig. 1—4) meist über morschem Holz, bei Moriola sanguifica über fremdem Algenlager ausgebreitet sind. Die braune Panzerkruste der Goniocysten entsteht dadurch, dass die dünnen zylindrischen Hyphenzellen unter Beibehaltung ihrer Dicke (2 µ), stark in die Breite wachsen und die Gestalt von Kugelsektoren annehmen. Sie werden meistens nicht viel über 2 µ dick, können aber bis 4 µ dick werden, wenn sich die Aussenwand höckerartig verdickt. Näheres hierüber in meiner Osloer Arbeit¹) und in den Berichten der Deutschen Botanischen Gesellschaft 2).Die Früchte einer von Herrn P. GROENHART an mich übersandten Flechte (Fig. 5—7) sind von ihm in 3000 m Höhe auf Java gesammelt worden und entwickeln ihre sporenreichen Perithezien auf einem etwa 1 cm mächtigen, lockeren Lagermasse von fast rein schwarzer Färbung. Diese rührt von Holzkohle her, die in grösseren oder ganz kleinen Bruchstücken, selten in Form angekohlter Zweige zwischen und unter den Goniocysten liegen. Die in den Goniocysten der tieferen Schichten enthaltenen Gonidien sind alle abgestorben und sehen jetzt braun aus. Nur in den Goniocysten der obersten Schicht sind die Gonidien noch jugendfrisch, sehen hellgrün aus und heben sieh deutlich von der dunkelbraunen, 4 µ dicken Kruste ab: eine einfache d.h. einkammerige Goniocyste mit 21.8 µ. Durchmesser, so dass auf den Innenraum fast 14 µ Durchmesser kamen; in ihr hatten drei Gonidien Platz. Bei einer anderen, zusammengesetzten Goniocyste hatte sich an diametral gegenüberliegenden Punkten der Goniocyste je eine Gonidie angesetzt und war von der braunen Kruste auch noch umwachsen worden, so dass die beiden kleinen Endkammern je eine Gonidie enthielten, die Mittelkammer deren drei. Es kommen aber auch noch grössere zusammengesetzte Goniocysten vor, deren Mittelkammer 5 und mehr Gonidien enthält.

N2  - Archboldia, nov. gen. — Frutices; folia opposita; inflorescentiae terminales, paniculato-corymbosae, e cymis compositae; calyx plus minusve patens, infundibuliformis, 5-lobatus; corolla exserta, ventricoso-cylindrica, utrinque glabra, aetinomorpha, breviter 5-lobata; stamina 4 alternipetalia, introrsa, dorsifixa haud exserta, monodynamia, corollae paulo sub fauce inserta, breviter filamentosa; ovarium 4-sulcatum, bicarpellatum, imperfecte 4-loculatum, ovula 4 anatropa placentis basi-parietalibus inflexis affixa; stylus haud exsertus, stigmate subulato; cetera desunt.Though the material is very scanty and not very well preserved, we may suppose with some probability that this is the representative of a new genus. It cannot be combined with any Verbenaceous genus thusfar known from Malaysia, New Guinea, Australia or Polynesia, being particularly distinguished by its peculiarly glabrous, inflate and actinomorphous corolla and its mododynamous and very short stamens. These features remind somewhat of certain Ericaceae, hence the specific name, chosen for the only species known at the time.

N2  - A comparative anatomical study on the leaves of nine out of 29 species of the genus Daphniphyllum was performed to seek support for the present infrageneric classification. Daphniphyllum is composed of two sections, Lunata (with one subsection Lunata) and Daphniphyllum (with two subsections, Daphniphyllum and Staminodia).The glabrous leaves with brachyparacytic stomata appear in all species in this study; hemiparacytic, laterocytic or anomocytic stomata occur in some taxa. Two (out of three) species of section Lunata show irregular epidermal cells with undulate anticlinal walls on both surfaces and hemiparacytic stomata. Of section Daphniphyllum seven (out of 26) species were sampled; they have curved, straight or undulate anticlinal cell walls and laterocytic or anomocytic stomata. The anatomical features found in this study are useful for identification on the specific level, but there is no support for the current infrasectional classification of section Daphniphyllum; further study on section Daphniphyllum is necessary.

N2  - Although this journal is more particularly destined to contain the results of taxonomical and geographical studies, it may sometimes provide accomodation for subjects of a different, though kindred nature. The more so, when an item is concerned, which is, in some way or another, closely allied to the editing institution.The apparently long-forgotten XVth Century MS., rediscovered in the library of the Rijksherbarium, is therefore a worthy subject for a series of papers under the general title proposed above. It has been carefully transponed into modern type, as may appear from the quotations given. Both the entire rewritten MS. and the original may be consulted in the Rijksherbarium and I avail myself of this opportunity to request the interest and, if possible, the cooperation of anyone, who may know something to solve the problem of its origin.

N2  - Im Laufe des Jahres 1935 wurde von uns in der Bibliothek des Reiehsherbariums in Leiden eine alte botanische Handschrift gefunden, welche wir ihrer grösstenteils sehr guten Wasserfarbenzeichnungen wegen, hier einer näheren Besprechung unterziehen wollen.Das Manuskript, das wahrscheinlich ursprünglich mit einer Einbanddecke versehen war, wurde lose in einem nicht hinzugehörigen Pergamentband aus dem 18. Jahrhundert angetroffen. Es besteht aus 87 Blättern, numeriert von 36 bis zu 123 einschliesslich; fol. 98 fehlt. Die Höhe der Blätter beträgt 29.2, die Breite 21.2 cm. Das erste Blatt, fol. 36 (r), enthält die Bemerkung: Msstum Botan. Saec. XV, und ist weiter mit einem aufgeklebten Zettel versehen, welcher vermutlich die Unterzeichnung Schrank trägt, und in dem dieser mitteilt, dass es hier eine Handschrift betreffe, die aus dem Nachlass eines bestimmten GLACIUS herrühre. Weiter haben wir betreffs der Herkunft des Manuskripts und der Weise wie das Reichsherbarium es erworben hat, leider nichts ermitteln können.

N2  - Thanks to the kind cooperation of Dr. ROBERT PILGER, Director of the Botanical Gardens and Museums at Berlin-Dahlem, I have recently had the privilege of studying and photographing a unique specimen belonging to that institution, which bears the words „Schizostachyum Blumii nobis”, in the hand of NEES, the author of the species. Although there are no data on the sheet to indicate its source, or the date of the determination, this presumably represents NEES’S type³) of this species (which is the type species of the genus). At any rate, the available evidence 4) points to that conclusion, and the specimen agrees in all respects with NEES’ description of the genus and of the type species (NEES, 1829, pp. 534—5). Since the original characterizations are so brief and, since those parts referring to the spikelets are so difficult to interpret, I present here a full description 5) of the rather fragmentary type specimen.

N2  - Being occupied with studies on the Convolvulaceae of Netherlands India I met with a remarkable specimen in the Buitenzorg Herbarium, collected by Dr. O. POSTHUMUS during the expedition in Djambi (Sumatra) in the year 1925. At first sight this plant seemed to be a Merremia. A closer examination, however, soon showed some important differences with that genus, especially in respect to the corolla, which has a long, narrow and rather fleshy tube and a limb with 5 short, reflexed (or patent?) lobes. Each lobe is deeply bifid, so that the limb appears 10-lobed. The middle part of the lobes is fleshy just as the tube; it corresponds with a midpetaline field of the corolla of most genera of Convolvulaceae, the lateral parts of the lobes (lobules) are much thinner, membranaceous and nerved. They represent the interpetaline fields of the Convolvulaceous corolla. In general there is a resemblance with the essential corolla construction of many species of Erycibe, where the lobes are also bifid and possess a thick middle part and two membranaceous lobules. The lobules in the new genus are not fully equal in size, those on the right of each lobe, as seen from the inside of the corolla being always slightly larger. The corolla is fully glabrous or bears some papillae at the base of the filaments. The pistil has a two-celled ovary, each cell with 2 ovules and bears a long, filiform style with two globular, papillose stigmas, exactly as in Merremia. I suppose this plant to be closely related to that genus, but as the corolla with its fleshy tube and remarkable lobes is so different from all other species, it is impossible to incorporate it in Merremia without important alteration of the generic limits. I, therefore, propose to establish a new genus, under the name of Decalobanthus (derived from dexa, ten, λoβoς, lobe and άνζος, flower).

N2  - Prom the time of CORREA DE SERRA (1805), MIRBEL. (1813), DE JUSSIEU (1815), ROEMER (1846), BAILLON (1855), and OLIVER (1861), a great stress is laid upon the number of stamens, locules, and ovules to the primary classification of the Rutaceae-Aurantioideae, but the importance of the presence of an inflorescence and its reduction of the number of flowers, the pinnate leaf and its reduction of the number of leaflets, venation of the leaf, its conspicuousness and the construction, the origin and development of the wing upon the rachis and the petiole, the number and the nature of thorns upon the branches, the fundamental number of the floral organs and its increase or decrease, the formation of pulp vesicles, the hardening of the rind of fruits, and other points affecting the universal affinity of plants as a whole, have been quite neglected in the past, the consideration of which would have helped the orderly development of the taxonomy of the subfamily. It is clear that the increased number of the floral organs and the development of the pulp vesicles are undoubtedly very important systematic features of the subfamily, but such are those out of many significant characteristics which take part in the classification of the whole group. A character like the increase or decrease of the number of locules, for instance, can occur even within one genus, as in the well-known case of Citrus and Fortunella. The ovules may be single, or binary, either superposed or collateral, or otherwise numerous in uni-, or biseriate arrangement: the gradation of this character is also continuous, as in the case of Merope Triphasia, and Wenzelia, all having similar floral characteristics but the last only has biseriate ovules. Unquestionably, the biseriate character is derived from collateral arrangement which is commoner in rather advanced groups. The increase of the number of filaments more than ten, occurs also in tribes not closely related, as Aegle (also Feroniella, and Balsamocitrus Section Afraegle), Oxanthera, and Citrus (also Poncirus and Fortunella), but the true pleiotaxy of stamens occurs only in Aegle and in the Section Citrophorum of the genus Citrus. The pulp-vesicle formation is also seen in various tribes widely divergent from each other, such as Aegleae-Swingleinae (Swinglea), Lavangeae (Pleiospermium), Atalantieae (Atakmtia and Severinia), Microcitreae (Microcitrus, Eremocitrus, Monanthocitrus and Pleurocitrus), Aurantieae-Citropsinae (Citropsis), and Aurantieae-Citrinae (Poncirus, Citrus and Fortunella).It is very clear that the starting point of the subfamily is represented by Micromelum and Glycosmis, both having pinnate leaves with alternate leaflets and unwinged rachis, many-flowered inflorescences, an ovary with less than 5 locules and one or two superposed ovules in each locule. Having dry fruits and contortuplicate cotyledons, Micromelum forms the most primitive tribe Micromeleae, somewhat analogous to the Rutoideae-Cusparieae of tropical America. The genera Glycosmis, Murraya and Clausena, altogether forming the tribe Clauseneae, have fleshy fruit, plano-convex cotyledons and unarmed branches with pinnate leaves, resembling the Micromelum in general appearance of the plant. It is worthy of note that the great reduction of the number of leaflets is seen in such species, as Micromelum diversifolium MIQ., Clausena Guillauminii TANAKA, and Murraya stenocarpa TANAKA (= Chalcas stenocarpa TANAKA) , and the alate rachis is found in Clausena Wallichii OLIV., C. Guillauminii TANAKA and Murraya alata DRAKE. The reduction of the number of locules in Murraya is also to be noted. No thorn-bearing plants occur in these tribes, except in the doubtful species, Clausena impunctata HIERN, which has curved paired axillary spines, almost entirely opposite leaflets, and a distinctly winged rachis. The gradation of this tribe into the next tribe Aegleae, having hard-shelled fruits, is seen in the Malayan genus Merrillia, which has large flowers, reminding of Murraya (Subgen. Euchalcas TANAKA), and a winged rachis like M. alata, mentioned above.

II, Vol. 52, Jan.-March-May 1935, 112 pp. (repagination [Pages in the original: 25—67, 171—203, 363—398] with 46 photographs, 36 of which in the reprint only, and a phytogeographical map. The reprint preceded by a short preface, a (too) short index and a dedication to FRANZ JUNGHUHN „as a memory to his arrival in Java, one hundred years ago”.It is a great pleasure to me indeed to announce here, more particularly on behalf of those readers who are not familiar with the Dutch language, this excellent work on the phytogeography of Malaysia, published in the Journal of the Royal Netherlands Geographical Society and therefore, moreover, likely less accessible to many botanists abroad. The author has, though only about 6 years engaged in botanical work in the tropics, gathered a remarkably thorough knowledge of the rich flora of this region, no doubt one of the most interesting ones, from a biogeographic standpoint, on earth. As the phytogeography of these parts has mostly, since JUNGHUHN’S „Java” (1854), been only dealt with in scattered papers, VAN STEENIS has in the publication under reference, as well as in some others that preceded it ¹), done a pioneer work in his attempt to give a comprehensive and more or less complete survey of the current problems. Our gratitude and admiration is not in the least diminished by the fact that this work shows certain traces of cursoriness and disequilibriousness, as well as a certain want of continuity and well-ponderedness. These features are mostly inherent to all pioneer work and the author himself states in the preface, that this work is meant as a provisional publication; this is in accordance with the title, which, by the way, could have been more adequately chosen, e. g.: Materials to Malaysian Phytogeography („Maleische” is, in my opinion, in Dutch a less felicitous word). Indeed, this paper contains a great many informations and stimulating ideas, and moreover, an almost complete bibliography, also of many papers in Dutch. It may be supposed indeed that there is, at present, hardly any other botanist available who is more capable than VAN STEENIS to continue this work and to prepare, some time, a complete „Phytogeography of Malaysia”, to which we are looking forward with great interest.

N2  - This extensive collection, famous among algologists both of the Old and the New World, forms part of the collections of the National Herbarium (Rijksherbarium) Leiden since 1934. About fifty years ago it was started by Mrs. Dr. A. A. WEBER-VAN BOSSE (1852—hodie), an enthusiastic pupil of HUGO DE VRIES.The colonies of Nostoc, living in the ditches round about the Dutch village of Doom, evoked her admiration, which was the primary cause of an intense study in the freshwater as well as in the marine Algae. In the harbour of Den Helder North Sea Algae were collected; by collecting Algae on trips to the French Atlantic Coasts and several times to Norway (1883—1885) and further on a South African journey (1894—1895) the herbarium grew, as it did by the Malaysian specimens collected in Java, Celebes, etc. (1888—1889). During this Malaysian tour Mrs. WEBER worked in Tjibodas, where she described the new genus Phytophysa. In Sumatra (West Coast, Lake of Manindjau) she discovered in collaboration with her husband, MAX WEBER, a new case of symbiosis between Algae and Sponges.

N2  - This research was conducted to inventory and assess the flora of Mt Hamiguitan. Field reconnaissance and transect walk showed four vegetation types, namely: dipterocarp, montane, typical mossy and mossy-pygmy forests. Inventory of plants showed a total of 878 species, 342 genera and 136 families. Of these, 698 were angiosperms, 25 gymnosperms, 41 ferns and 14 fern allies. Assessment of conservation status revealed 163 endemic, 34 threatened, 33 rare and 204 economically important species. Noteworthy findings include 8 species as new record in Mindanao and one species as new record in the Philippines. Density of threatened species is highest in the dipterocarp forest and decreases at higher elevation. Species richness was highest in the montane forest and lowest in typical mossy forest. Endemism increases from the dipterocarp to the montane forest but is lower in the mossy forest. The results are compared with data from other areas.

N2  - Dr. C. A. BACKER, Verklarend Woordcnboek van wetenschappelijke plantennamen (Explanatory dictionary of scientific plantnames) — Noordhoff-Kolff, Groningen-Batavia, 1936 — XII + 664 — Price: flh. 19.50.Many botanists and also sylvi-, liorti- and agriculturists and almost all taxonomists are, in the course of their daily task, meeting plant-names, the exact meaning, signification or derivation of which is not immediately clear to them. Being an intelligent and studious man, he often feels the desire to know more of a name than just its orthography and so he makes a grab at one of those books written to spread more knowledge about the matter. If it is the name of a genus or of a subgenus, WITTSTEIN’S „IIandwörterbuch” is the book he needs, although it yields no help for genera younger than 1852 (date of preface). If it is a specific name or a latin or latinized botanical term, BISCHOFF is his man, either by his „Handbuch der botanischen Terminologie” of 1833—1844 or by his smaller „Wörterbuch der beschreibenden Botanik”, of 1857 (2nd Ed.). In case these books cannot meet his wishes, on account of their age or merely out of deficiency, our present-day investigator will try to find the name in one of the more recent lists: BAILEY’S „Companion for the Queensland student of plant life” of 1893; SALOMON-SCHELLE, Worterbuch der botanischen Kunstsprache, 1904; KANNGIESSER, Etymologie der Phanerogamen-Nomenclatur, 1908 (mainly generic names); Voss, Botanisches Hilfs- und Wörterbuch (6th ed. 1922), etc.

N2  - This publication is a continuation of „Plantenkaartjes voor Nederland”, published by Dr. J. W. C. GOETHART and Dr. W. J. JONG MANS in the years 1902—1908. For both publications the same methods, differing in two respects from those usually adopted elsewhere, have been employed.As in the first place it is utterly impossible to show on a very small-scale map, the exact spot where a certain species of plant is to be found, this mock-accuracy has been avoided. Only that part of the topographical map is indicated, which contains the finding-place. With this end in view, each of the 64 sheets of the survey-map of the Netherlands is covered by a net of 48 rectangles, each side being approximately one hour’s walk long (exactly 4180 X 5000 metres). These rectangles are called „hour-squares”, each being subdivided into 16 „quarter-hoursquares” of 1045 X 1250 metres. The „hour-square”, in which any special finding-place of a plant occurs, is clearly shown on a photo-lithographically reduced map with the „hour-square” division. As the scale of the reduced map is left large enough, even the „quarter-hour-square” in question can be clearly distinguished within its „hour-square”.

N2  - It is generally known that botanical nomenclature, though sprung from mediaeval scientific Latin, and agreeing, in its orthography for the greater part, in its grammar as much as possible, with classical Latin, shows countless forms which not only from a classical-grammatical, but also from a mediaeval-grammatical point of view, must be looked upon as errors. These errors are for the greater part due to an inadequate knowledge of Latin and Greek grammar, or to indifference or lack of good taste on the part of botanists. And since a botanist cannot be expected to abstain from giving new names to plants until in the opinion of philologists he is sufficiently acquainted with Latin, Greek and other languages which he may have to use, it is unavoidable that the number of philological mistakes in botanical nomenclature should be steadily increasing. It may be disputed whether the mistakes should be corrected, or whether, granting the desirability, such a thing is impossible. The present author was at one time convinced that correction ought to take place systematically, but after some attempts to contribute to it he realised that it was impossible to carry it through in a consistent manner without detriment to botany, and that a non-consistent or a consistentpartial correction would also cause difficulties without giving satisfaction. In any case great indulgence is desirable towards the countless mistakes that have been made in good faith.This, however, does not alter the fact that it is in all respects desirable to avoid such mistakes in future to the best of our knowledge.

N2  - When BUSE gave an enumeration of the grasses collected by JUNGHUHN in Java and Sumatra, he mentioned under Paspalum a species, described by RETZIUS in the year 1781 as Paspalum hirsutum. BUSE identified a grass from Sumatra as being the species of RETZIUS, on account of the description, having certainly not studied the authentic specimen, which was at that time not easy to consult. It may be that even the work of RETZIUS was not at his disposal, it is probable that he studied only the description, given afterwards in LAMARCK’S Encyclopédie. RETZIUS described his species from China, where it was collected by BLADH. Although the description of RETZIUS agrees fairly well with BUSE’S plant, we are in modern times not so satisfied with such an identification, because it is a priori not sure at all that the Chinese species is identic with a grass from the high plateau of Sumatra, the more because since the description by RETZIUS and the identification by BUSE, such a Paspalum was never found in the wide area between China and Sumatra. I therefore carefully studied the type of RETZIUS at the herbarium of Lund (Sweden), which was kindly forwarded for study from the director at Lund and I compared it with BUSE’S type, preserved at the Rijksherbarium. The latter is in a very good condition. Already at first sight the two types agree very much especially in the vegetative parts, the number of racemes, their length and general form In the genus Paspalum, a very large one, much weight is given by agrostologists to the form and outline of the spikelets and I will therefore give my opinion on the type of RETZIUS first. The plant consists of an upper part of the culm with 3 very hirsute leaves and 2 distant racemes. The spikelets have hairy pedicels, the short hairs are sparingly mixed with long ones. The form of the spikelets is obovate-oblong; they are obtuse at the summit and rounded. The first glume (mostly rudimentary in the genus) is wanting the second one, which is very convex, is slightly shorter than the spikelet, minutely punctulate and provided with 5 very strong nerves, a midnerve and two marginal ones, the latter anastomosing upwards and running into the midnerve at the top, which is thickened where the nerves meet. The sterile lemma or third glume is flat and as long as the spikelet; it has 3 strong nerves, a midnerve and 2 submarginal ones, anastomosing at the summit; the true margins are membranaceous and distinctly hairy at the middle, the hairs more or less flexuous or curved. Besides these 3 nerves there are 2 more nerves at a rather broad distance from the midnerve; these two nerves are faint and distinct only at the base of the glume and evanescent upwards, being undulate and giving that part of the glume a scrobiculate, transversely wrinkled appearance. The fruit (fertile lemma) is dark brown and exposed by the shortness of the covering glume. From all these characters it is evident that RETZIUS’S plant belongs to a group of species in the genus Paspalum called by Mrs. AGNES CHASE the „plicatula”. Representative species of this group are the well-known New World Paspalum plicatulum Michx. and the variable Old World species Paspalum scrobiculatum L.. The characters of the true Paspalum hirsutum are given on my plate, which is an exact copy of the type specimen, the spikelets being magnified 10 times. Returning to BUSE’S plant from Sumatra, I indicate here the different characters of the spikelets. Their form and outline is different, they are not only a little longer but more elliptic, not rounded at the summit but distinctly obtusely apiculate; the convex glume is 3-nerved only, the marginal nerves not doubled, the glume is longer than the fertile lemma, obtecting it entirely and protruding above it; the flat sterile lemma is more narrowed upwards too with 3 very distinct nerves and 2 interjecting faint ones, the surface is wrinkled as in the American Paspalum plicatulum and the body of the glume is perfectly glabrous. Comparing types and the figures given by me, we see thus that there are distinct differences between the spikelets of the two types and it is therefore evident that we have here two different species. These differences between the two species as to the morphological characters are supported by the very different geographical distribution, the plant described by BUSE being hitherto only known from the prairies of the plateau of Padang lawas in Sumatra. Since BUSE described his species and the characters of the spikelets are given here in extenso, it is not necessary to describe BUSE’S plant once more. It is named here after the collector Dr HORNER as a species, endemic on Sumatra, the Paspalum Horneri HENR. = Paspalum hirsutum BUSE, non RETZIUS.A puzzling plant was described by BUSE in the year 1856 in DE VRIESE’S Plantae Indiae Batavae Orientalis as Streptachne indica. BUSE was an accurate observer and described this plant exactly but he unfortunately overlooked an important character. Having studied his type, a plant collected on Java by REINWARDT, I found that the spikelets have an articulation below the glume and thus easily fall of in toto. In the large tribe of the Agrostideae to which BUSE’S plant belongs, this Streptachne is thus not a member of the subtribe Stipeae as BUSE supposed, this subtribe having always an articulation above the glumes which are persistent at maturity. It was thus at once evident that BUSE’S plant was not a Steptachme at all, but more allied with such genera as Polypogon and Chaeturus. It belongs to the genus Garnotia which is already known from Java. BUSE’S species is placed by me under Garnotia stricta BROGN.

Das Ziel der Untersuchung war den Bau des Blütenstandes und der Blüten von Arceuthobium Dacrydii RIDLEY zu ermitteln und festzustellen, ob diese Pflanze wirklich ein Arceuthobium ist oder, wie eine oberflächliche Untersuchung des Blütenstandes es vermuten liess, eine Korthalsella; und falls letzteres sich wirklich als richtig herausstellen sollte, weiter festzustellen, wie der Bau des Andrözeums dieser Art ist, welches für Arten dieser Gattung von VAN TIEGHEM, HAYATA und LECOMTE in verschiedener Weise beschrieben wird. § 2. Material und Methode. Das Material zu dieser Untersuchung stammte von Pflanzen, welche 1931 von Zweigen von Podocarpus imbricata BLUME im Walde des Naturreservates Tjibodas auf dem Gunung Gedé in Westjava gesammelt wurden, und zwar teilweise von F. W. WENT oder C. G. G. J. VAN STEENIS s.n. (vgl. Bull. Jard. Bot. Buitenz., ser. 3, 11, p. 456) und teilweise von W. M. DOCTERS VAN LEEUWEN (NO. 14166). Die letzteren wurden freundlichst vom Sammler aus seinen Privatsammlungen zur Verfügung gestellt. Die spezifische Identität mit dem ursprünglichen Arceuthobium Dacrydii wurde durch erneute Vergleichung mit dessen Typus, der sich im Besitze des Botanischen Gartens zu Singapore befindet und nochmals gütigst von der Direktion dieses Institutes für unsern Zweck zugesandt wurde, festgestellt.

N2  - The Ericaceous genus Rigiolepis was founded by Sir JOSEPH D. HOOKER (Ic. plant, third ser. II (1876), 54, pl. 1160) on a single species from Borneo, viz. R. borneensis HOOK.F. HOOKER was not quite sure about some of the characteristics, and failed to compare it with Vaccinium to which genus, indeed, several authors have reduced it.In 1914 I have discussed the Rigiolepis question (in Ic. Bog. IV, 68) in the note under Vaccinium uniflorum J. J. S. and was inclined to believe that Rigiolepis should be maintained as a distinct genus, although my material was not sufficient to solve the question definitely. Since I have studied many other species of this affinity and I do not hesitate to accept the genus.

It is a well-known fact, that the Malay Peninsula and the Philippines have a flora, which is related to that of the Malay Archipelago, sensu stricto, belonging to the same region indeed. The Compositae of these parts have, however, been recently dealt with by RIDLEY (Fl. Mal. Pen. II, 1923, 177) and by MERRILL (Enum. Phil. Flow. Pl. III, 1923, 591) respectively, whereas those from New Guinea, which is floristically less related to the Malay Archipelago, have been worked out by MATTFELD (Engl. Bot. Jahrb. LXII, 1929, 386).The material, used for this paper, chiefly belongs to the National Herbarium (Rijksherbarium), Leiden (L), the Herbarium of the Botanical Gardens, Buitenzorg (B) and the University Herbarium, Utrecht (U); for the rest it is to be found in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (K) and the Herbarium of the British Museum, London (Br. M.); some specimens of the Herbarium of the Linnean Society of London and of the Herbarium of the „Conservatoire botanique de la ville de Genève” (G) have also been studied, whereas the type specimen of Vernonia arborea was discovered in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. I feel greatly indebted to the Directors of these herbaria for their kindness in putting these materials at my disposal.

N2  - Vierentwintig jaren zijn verloopen sinds de instelling, die toen „’s Rijks Herbarium” heette, begon met de uitgave van een reeks publicaties onder den titel van „Mededeelingen van ’s Rijks Herbarium Leiden”. Juist 70 nummers zijn verschenen tusschen 1910 en 1933, met inbegrip van het laatstgenoemde jaar, de meeste daarvan onder het directoraat van Dr J. W. C. Goethart. Het is hier zeker de plaats Dr Goethart dank te brengen voor alles wat hij in die jaren voor deze uitgave van het Rijksherbarium heeft gedaan.Nadat ondergeteekende op 2 October 1933 het directoraat van het Rijksherbarium uit de handen van den waarnemenden directeur, Dr W. A. Goddijn, had overgenomen, kon een begin worden gemaakt met de uitvoering van enkele plannen, die in verband met zijn ervaring, in de tropen opgedaan, eenig perspectief voor de toekomst schenen te beloven. Zoo lag het, op grond van de zooeven genoemde ervaring voor de hand, dat de werkwijze van het Rijksherbarium zich meer in de richting van de Nederlandsch-Indische flora zou gaan bewegen, dan in de laatste decenniën mogelijk was geweest. Verwezenlijking van deze gedachte is mogelijk door samenwerking met het Herbarium en Museum van Systematische Botanie van ’s Lands Plantentuin te Buitenzorg, waarmede ik reeds voor mijn vertrek uit Indië in dien geest overeenstemming mocht bereiken.

GOETHART, to whom many thanks are due for his arduous work and his many cares in favour of these publications.After the undersigned, oil October 2nd, 1933, had taken over the directorate of the Rijksherbarium from the acting director, Dr W. A. GODDIJN, he could start realizing some projects which, in relation to his tropical experience, seemed more or less promising. First of all it was obvious that the Rijksherbarium should, to a greater degree than had been possible during the last decennia, contribute to the investigation of the flora of the Netherlands Indies. Effectuating this idea seems possible by a closer collaboration with the Herbarium of the Botanical Gardens of Buitenzorg, Java, with whose officers it was my privilege to come to an agreement before I left the colony. Another point to be considered was the establishment of a closer contact with the State University at Leiden, the herbarium of which has been united with the Rijksherbarium since 1832. This contact has been rather loose in various periods of the existence of the Rijksherbarium and in developing it, the details will have to be carefully studied and sounded, lest the archive value of the collection should be decreased. Without taking any risk as to this point, which cannot be fully compensated by the advantages, it is thought that a closer contact is both possible and desirable, as it may further two important interests: in the first place it is intended to exploit and to peruse both more intensively and more extensively the treasures of this Herbarium, and secondly an attempt will be made to increase the number of students in the field of investigation that is allotted to the institution.

N2  - Anlässlich der Centenarsfeier des „Rijksherbarium” zu Leiden im Jahre 1930 schrieb Prof. Dr L. DIELS in Berlin-Dahlem einen Beitrag, betitelt „Herbarien und Sammler”, für die „Herdenkingsuitgave” der „Mededeelingen van ’s Rijks Herbarium” (No. 62—69, Leiden, 1931). In diesem Beitrag wurde Wert und Bestimmung von Herbarien und die Aufgabe des Sammlers gekennzeichnet. Durch das Sammeln ganzer Pflanzen und genauer Etikettierung können, so führte DIELS aus, die Sammler viel beitragen zur Vermehrung der botanischen Kenntnis, u. a. von den Verbreitungsgebieten der Pflanzen und der Pflanzenökologie. DIELS kommt zu dem Schluss: „Selbst in den alten Kulturländern liegen dankbare Aufgaben in dieser Richtung vor. Doch am grössten ist die Verantwortung der Anstalten, die ihre Arbeit in erster Linie auf die tropischen Floren wenden. Denn das Gesamtbild, das wir uns von der Pflanzenwelt machen, gewinnt seinen Umfang, seine Mannigfaltigkeit und viele besondere Farben aus den Floren der Tropen. Mit der fortschreitenden Vernichtung der ursprünglichen Zustände in den, wärmeren Ländern droht dieses Bild zu verarmen und eintöniger zu werden, ehe wir noch wirklich seinen Reichtum begriffen haben”.Java, das heutigentags grösstenteils Kulturland geworden ist, bestätigt die Wahrheit des zitierten Satzes überdeutlich. So sind, um ein spezielles Beispiel herauszugreifen, die Urwälder der Niederung, welche früher grosse Flächen bedeckten, bis auf kleine Resten Opfer der Kultivierung geworden, lange bevor man die ursprüngliche Vegetation in ihren Elementen gut kennen gelernt hatte. Möge die Entdeckung von Relikten heute auch interessant sein, vom pflanzengeographischen Standpunkt aus muss man sehr bedauern, dass die systematische Erforschung der Vegetation nicht vor der Vernichtung des Urzustandes zu gewisser Vollendung gebracht werden konnte.

N2  - For the ecologist systematic units are actors in a play. Whatever their christian- and family-names may be — it is their role, whether master or servant, whether villain or hero — which determines the character of the performance. This performance has, moreover, the property of being both continuous and simultaneous: all scenes are given at once. Such a continuous and simultaneous performance is called a biocoenosis.In a great many ways, a biocoenosis reminds us of an organism. For the coördination between organs or tissues, or even cells is also continuous and simultaneous. A biocoenosis is a higher vital unit, and may be approached by the same methods which we use for the study of organisms (V. D. KLAAUW (24)). In the systematic approach we establish the name, sex and age of the actors, in the anatomical approach the “pattern” of the constitutional units is established (“the dramatical situation”), while the physiological approach is concerned with the metabolism of the entity (“the plot”). As counterpart of these methods, however, we have to consider the study of the environment. The environment, which LOTKA has called “the stage of the life drama” (28).

N2  - After Mr. S. BLOEMBERGEN had planned a revision of the Cornaceae, sensu amplissimo, of the Netherlands Indies (inclusive those of the Malay Peninsula and the non-Dutch parts of Borneo and New Guinea) and had received, for that purpose, herbarium materials from different institutes, it appeared desirable to him to confine his revision to the Alangiaceae. I therefore took the Cornaceae, sensu stricto, for my account. It was very convenient to me that Mr. BLOEMBERGEN had already composed a nearly complete list of literature wanted.The herbaria of which materials have been worked up in this revision, arE the following.

N2  - A phylogenetic system resulting from comparative morphological studies claims to be the expression of evolution. The character of any phylogenetic classification based on morphological studies exclusively is a speculative one. The fragmental facts procured by fossil relicts from earlier geological periods are also morphological and allow only the conclusion that evolution took place, but in which way changes evolved has not been stated by immediate observation.Nobody escapes from the idea that all living beings existing yet, have originated from those in the past. It is undeniable that the vegetation which covered the earth in former periods has been changed. This historical process seen as a continuity possible by the power of reproduction of the organisms is called evolution. The idea of evolution which as a consequence of Darwinian views penetrated into taxomony is cause of the fact that species, families, ordines, phyla were considered to be more than categoric divisions; they should represent relationships or lines of descent. Taxomony got a fundamental frame: phylogeny!

N2  - Some years ago I had the opportunity to study more extensively a very interesting group of grasses, belonging to what is now accepted as a distinct genus, the genus Digitaria, formerly belonging as a subgenus to the genus Panicum. As to living plants of this group I was familiar with two european species, also found in the Netherlands. They are treated in the Synopsis of Ascherson nd Gräbner and once more in the second edition of this work. Under Panicum they bear the names P. lineare KROCKER and P. sanguinale L. The first species belongs to HACKEL’S „Ternata”, the name is invalid on account of the Panicum lineare of LINNAEUS, a species described from India, we know that KROCKER’s plant does not occur in India and it is therefore necessary to look for the correct name of the species. A more detailed study of the synonyms and their priority proves that the valid name is that of SCHREBER, published by SCHWEIGGER as Panicum Ischaemum. ASCHERSON gave as the date of publication for this name, the year 1811, if this was indeed correct, our species had to bear the name of Digitaria humifusa PERSOON, published in the year 1805, the citation of the year 1811 by ASCHERSON is however wrong as SCHREBER’S name was published in the year 1804. This is evident from SCHRADER’S work, where is published the same species as Syntherisma glabrum, this was done in the year 1806 and as a synonym is given the Panicum Ischaemum SCHREBER, given in SCHWEIGGER’s Flora. It was MUHLENBERG, who, in the year 1817 took up SCHREBER’S name under Digitaria, he published the species as Digitaria Ischaemum with SCHREBER as author. The name of our species, which also occurs in America, is thus Digitaria Ischaemum (SCHREB.) SCHREB. ap. MUHLENBERG. It is curious that such a common species escaped to the attention of LINNAEUS. The species is easy to recognize and not very variable. Among the few varieties the most characteristic one is the var. prostrata (ASCH. et GR.) HENR. nov. comb., with long runners rooting at the nodes; the variety hirta (JUNGE) HENR. is not so important, the lower sheaths are not always quite glabrous and a more or less distinct pubescence is not rarely observed.Our second species described as Panicum sanguinale becomes under Digitaria, the D. sanguinalis (L.) SCOPOLI. Botanists who have studied the type in the herbarium of LINNAEUS, indicate that this type represents the european plant treated under this name in our manuals. If we study only the literature of this species, we find that it is common all over the world, there is scarcely any flora where the species is not mentioned, with exception of the cold regions. All the tropical floras give the species as an indian plant and we find it thus in HOOKER’S Flora of British India and in the works of the recent Dutch botanists. Many years ago when I saw for the first time the so-called Panicum sanguinale, I found already that the Javanese plants did not agree with our european P. sanguinale and being familiar with the latter in the living state, I was not willing to accept the indian specimens as belonging to our D. sanguinalis. Since that time I could study a very extensive material of D. sanguinalis from localities all over the world and my opinion on the tropical plants was not changed. That we have two distinct species before us was already pointed out by the american botanist NASH, who accepted the plant from the southern regions of N. America as a distinct species under the name of Syntherisma marginata NASH, based upon LINK’S Digitaria marginata from the year 1821. Having studied LINK’S type in the Berlin Herbarium, I recognized it as being indeed the indian D. sanguinalis. LINK gave the locality as Brazil. It is further noteworthy that the very accurate Dutch botanist BUSE did not mention the Digitaria sanguinalis in his enumeration of JUNGHUHN’S indian grasses. Since NASH accepted the two species as different, modern american agrostologists neglected them in their works and accepted only a Digitaria sanguinalis. In the beautiful book of W. A. SILVEUS on the Texas grasses, only the Digitaria sanguinalis is taken up, although the typical D. marginata occurs there. The plate on p. 489 in SILVEUS’s book and also his drawings represent the D. marginata, it may be that the true D. sanguinalis, although represented in N. America too, is not found in Texas.

N2  - It has so often been emphasized that the flora of large tropical islands like New Guinea is still very imperfect, that the impression has been established that the data available should be in a state unapt to produce a conspectus or to procure valuable conclusions. Though it is certainly true that there are still immense plots of land entirely unknown from a botanical (or any other) point of view, and that we know but a part (but most probably more than one half) of the Papuan species of Pteridophytes and Spermatophytes, I am inclined to think that it is more than anything else the scattered nature of those data, that prevented us from realizing their intrinsic value. The time has come, I think, to pauze and to realize what has been done in the past years; to arrange the many uncoördinated data in such an order that, on one hand a comprehensive view may be obtained of what has come to our knowledge and on the other hand the gaps may become apparent. In this way it may be expected beforehand, that our present knowledge, however scanty it may be, may enable us to form some provisional conclusions of not too slight an importance and of not too mean reliability. Especially as far as floristics are concerned it is obvious that, for instance, consideration of one half of a flora will lead to practically the same conclusions as the whole flora would.In this investigation that is meant to be amplified by more detailed studies later on, I have, first of all, compiled an enumeration of the more important collectors and also of books and papers (cf. Annexes at the end of the present publication) which, together with the literature cited in some of them, may be considered as a basis to any student of the New Guinea flora, who desires to undertake a special investigation in this matter. As far as the facts are concerned my aims have been of a double nature; to get an impression of the principal associations of the island, and to arrange some floristic data in such a way, that they may become comparable to those of the surrounding islands and continents.

N2  - Bei der Einteilung der Organismen, welche in dieser Arbeit mir von botanischem Gesichtspunkt betrachtet wird, ist die Frage nach „wesentlichen” Merkmalen oder Einteilungsgründen von grosser Wichtigkeit. Es ist die Frage nach der Substanz (Essenz) und den akzidentellen Merkmalen. Der Substanzbegriff entstammt der Aristotelischen Logik und Metaphysik. Aeltere Botaniker, die sich die prinzipiellen Grundlagen ihres Systems klarzustellen versuchen, sind z.B. Cesalpin und Ray. Cesalpin kommt in seiner Auffassung der Substanz Aristoteles sehr nah. Ray, obwohl öfters noch Aristotelisch beeinflusst, hat eine typisch empiristische Auffassung der Substanz, wodurch er sich den Ansichten LOCKEs anschliesst. Auch in den modernen Theorien treten substantielle Formen auf. Driesch stellt seine Entelechie gleich Substanz, aber diese ist in der Systematik jetzt noch nicht anwendbar. Vavilov hat in seinem Begriff „Radikal” eine substantielle Form, die der Aristotelischen sehr nahe steht, indem sie durch Abstraktion dargestellt worden ist. Diese Form ist sehr brauchbar, sagt aber nur wenig aus. Von genetischer und physiologischer Seite versucht man Funktionsbegriffe einzuführen, welche jetzt aber in der Biologie nur eine sehr beschränkte Anwendung finden können. Ungeachtet ihrer Bedeutung, mit für die Systematik, kann man in letzterer Wissenschaft die festen, beharrlichen substantiellen Formen nicht entbehren, weil ohne diese jetzt noch keine Systematik möglich ist.

N2  - It is often a very difficult task for the many amateurs and cultivators of Orchids, and I may add hardly in a less degree to students of the flora of the Netherlands Indies, to classify properly the Orchids they come across. The reason for this lies not only in the fact that the generic characters in this large order are often not easily distinguished, but also in the fact that nearly every genus counts a certain number of more or less anomalous species, so that the limits between the genera are not always easy to determine. Besides, many descriptions are, even in principal points, incomplete, either because the authors had no sufficiently good material at their disposal, or because they did not take the trouble to draw up good descriptions. For these reasons species are unavoidably often placed into a wrong genus, to which fact a great deal of the prevailing confusion is to be ascribed.Although in the course of years many questions have been solved, it cannot be denied that new problems did arise. Only very accurate and complete descriptions, the best, of course, elucidated by figures after fresh or alcohol material, can put us in a position to decrease these difficulties.

Out of 54 taxa, 48 are endemic to Peninsular Malaysia.No fewer than 30 taxa are known from fewer than five localities; 24 taxa are Critically Endangered (CR), 3 are Endangered (EN) while 4 are Vulnerable (VU). One taxon is Extinct (EX), the 22 remaining are Near Threatened (NT), Least Concern (LC) and Data Deficient (DD). We discuss how the assessment was carried out and the implications for the long-term conservation of Begonia. The most significant conservation measure proposed here is the gazettement of limestone hills as totally protected areas.

Mit nur sehr wenigen Ausnahmen konnte ich fast alle Originale untersuchen. Ich habe auch den grössten Teil der Belege für die anderen Literaturangaben rediviert. Im folgenden werden nur Fundorte genannt, von denen ich Material untersuchen konnte.Die vorliegende Arbeit schliesst sich eng an meine Bearbeitung der Holostipae in „Nova Guinea” XVIII: 1—8 (1934) an. Früher, 1930, de Frullan. VIII (Nederl. Kruidk. Arch. 1930, p. 155—175), habe ich eine Revision der ozeanischen Frullanien gegeben. Damals wies ich schon auf die relativ kleine Anzahl der endemischen Arten Ozeaniens hin. Für die Holostipae kann man dasselbe feststellen. Die meisten ozeanischen Frullanien und Lejeuneen sind mit indomalayischen oder pantropischen Arten identisch oder nahe verwandt. Mehrere der in Ozeanien verbreiteten Jubuleen erreichen wohl die Marianen, Samoa, Tahiti, etc., fehlen aber auf Hawaii. Die meisten Inselgruppen besitzen einige endemische Arten, welche meistens deutliche Beziehungen zu indomalayischen Arten zeigen. Die auffallendsten und isoliertesten Endeme finden wir auf Neu-Kaledonien. Deutliche Beziehungen zwischen den Jubuleen von Australien und Neu-Kaledonien sind nicht festzustellen. Ausser typisch indomalayischen Sippen begegnen wir in Ozeanien einigen, wenn auch nicht vielen, rein neotropischen Gattungen, welche teilweise nur bis Hawaii, teilweise aber bis Australien, Neu-Seeland und bis Neu-Guinea vordringen.

Of the 23 species and infraspecific taxa involved, 5 are based on holotype collections, 3 were properly lectotypified by previous authors, and 15 are properly lectotypified here. L contains 5 holotypes, no holotype fragments, 13 lectotypes, and no lectotype fragments while TRH contains no holotypes, 5 holotype fragments, 5 lectotypes, and 6 lectotype fragments. Lithothamnion siamense is correctly lectotypified with material from the Gulf of Thailand and not from Siboga material, and a new lectotype with conceptacles is proposed to supersede the existing sterile lectotype of Archaeolithothamnion timorense. Isolectotypes and paratypes at L and TRH have been identified and marked, and information on the basionym, nature, extent, and location of type material, type locality and collection data, and references to published illustrations of type material have been provided for all species and infraspecific taxa. Brief comments on five rejected forma names are included.

One knows what can be expected; as far as I can see nothing has been changed as compared with the 18th Supplement. Worth mentioning is that whereas the 18th Supplement came out about one and a half year after the closing date – at that time already exceptional – with the present one this has been brought back to less than one year: the official date of publication is 15 November 1991. Important news can be found in the Foreword: “The printed annual Kew Index has been discontinued, but there are plans for a CD-ROM version of the complete Index Kewensis ... This electronic version is due to appear in 1992.” Whether additions will come out annually or every five years is not made clear.

Amyema comprises 92 species, and is distributed from the southeast Asian mainland (Malaya, Thailand) throughout the Malesian region to the southwest Pacific (Samoa) and Australia. Major centres of species richness are in the Philippines, New Guinea, and Australia. The genus is part of a floristic element of Gondwanan derivation, which has diversified in the northern part of the Australian plate, and reached the Malesian region from the east following the establishment of Charles’s Line.A comprehensive approach to species circumscription for the entire genus necessitates numerous nomenclatural changes to earlier regional treatments. Eight species are described as new, viz., A. arthrocaulis, A. eburna, A. enneantha, A. irrubescens, A. pyriformis, A. rhytidoderma, A. scheffleroides, and A. vernicosa. One subspecies, A. miraculosa subsp. latifolia, is described as new.

Idioblasts are always present in the spongy parenchyma in all species and in most cases also in the palisade parenchyma. Usually both oil cells and mucilage cells occur; in some species either oil or mucilage idioblasts are present. Their number ranges from few to abundant Both idioblast types possess a suberized wall layer. Mucilage cells are significantly larger than oil cells. The distribution patterns of oil and/or mucilage cells often do not coincide with the current classification into sections. Leaf features such as lamina thickness, the presence of sclereids in the mesophyll, crystals in the adaxial epidermis, hairs, an adaxial hypodermis, a thickened cuticle and the presence of a papillate abaxial epidermis and sunken stomata are compared with the distribution of oil and mucilage cells. Following an analysis of the systematic value of oil and mucilage cells it is concluded that combinations and frequencies of oil and mucilage cells are often useful in species identification, and sometimes indicate relationships between species. In general, the significance of oil and mucilage cells as phylogenetic markers is extremely limited as shown in tentative cladistic analyses of leaf anatomical characters.

N2  - The genus Lepidopetalum Blume (Sapindaceae) contains 6 species, of which one, L. fructoglabrum, is newly described. Four species are found on New Guinea of which one also occurs in Australia, one on the Nicobar Islands and Sumatra and one on the Philippines. Specimens from Java, Sulawesi, the Moluccas, and the Lesser Sunda Islands could not be identified due to the lack of mature fruits.The genus is characterized by typical domatia (hair tufts), petals (small, triangular with much larger, usually united scales), and fruits (flat, usually 2-locular, sarcotesta present). Important specific characters are the pilosity of the upper part of the pedicel, the shape of the disc, the type of hairs inside the fruit, and the type of sarcotesta.A putative phytogeny of the genus is selected together with an areagram for the distributions of the species and their ancestral species.

N2  - This is the second book by this author dealing with the Pinaceae. In 1984 he treated the genus Pinus, now he treats the remaining genera of the family. An overview of the genera and their species is given, as well as keys to the subfamilies and genera, and to the species. Various aspects of the taxa are described, including nomenclature, infraspecific delimitation, vegetative and generative morphology, ecology, and distribution pattern. The book is well illustrated with black-and-white drawings of each species, showing their habitus and a number of morphological details. The distributions are indicated on very small-sized world maps; in case of restricted distributions usually, but unfortunately not always, accompanied by a more detailed map. A separate chapter is devoted to the leaf anatomy of a selection of species representing the genera.The author presents his own ideas about the delimitation of taxa and their taxonomic position, including some new combinations. In the general introduction to the family, he discusses briefly the taxonomic subdivision into subfamilies. He presents a data matrix of the genera and a dendrogram on which he bases his classification in subfamilies. In my opinion the method he used is inconsistent. He does not explain which computer program has been used and how the dendrogram was made. Apparently the author used a phenetic analysis, but he aims at monophyletic groups (p. 3). A more consistent approach towards the classification within the Pinaceae is still needed. Nevertheless, this book presents a great deal of information on this family, and a useful and rather complete compilation of the state of affairs regarding their taxonomy.

N2  - The fifth and final volume of A.C. Smith’s ‘Flora Vitiensis Nova’ was issued in June 1991, thirteen years after the appearance of the first volume and nearly 120 years after Berthold Seemann’s ‘Flora Vitiensis’. The present volume contains the long awaited treatment of the Orchidaceae (by P.J. Kores) along with the following Dicot families (in alphabetical order): Acanthaceae, Asteraceae (with G.D. Carr), Bignoniaceae, Boraginaceae, Buddlejaceae, Campanulaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cuscutaceae, Gesneriaceae, Goodeniaceae, Lamiaceae (with S.P. Darwin), Menyanthaceae, Plantaginaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Solanaceae, and Verbenaceae (with S.P. Darwin). The volume furthermore contains addenda and corrigenda to the previous four volumes and an index to the whole series.The completion of this Flora is of major significance to students of Pacific Botany, who have earlier been greatly served by the ‘Manual of the flowering plants of Hawaii’ by Wagner et al. (1990) An overview of the completed Flora Vitiensis is now due. The flora follows Takhtajan’s system. Treatment of genera and species within each family follows the sequence in which they appear in the keys. The genus descriptions are ample but species descriptions are concise. Much attention is given to the typification, taxonomic problems, distribution (often also outside Fiji) and uses. No notes are added on ecology. Illustrations consist of photographs (mostly of herbarium specimens), some in colour (of living plants). Only some of the Orchidaceae are also illustrated by line drawings.

N2  - In the absence of a complete floristic inventory, conservation priorities within South East Asia must often be based on incomplete knowledge or a rough approximation of diversity such as habitat cover. To help overcome this, a database containing distribution data for all 3 523 known flowering plant genera across 53 geo-political regions covering all of Indo-China, Malesia and the Pacific has been compiled from regional floras and herbarium specimens at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Our database is currently 85 % complete and has been used in this preliminary analysis to show the broad patterns of plant diversity and floristic relationships in the South East Asian region. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the floristic richness, at genus level across the region, the relationships between the different areas and to highlight the areas within the region that are of most pressing conservation concern.

N2  - To date, a total of 288 species from 96 genera were identified from the limestone areas in Perlis and Padawan-Bau, Sarawak, of which many of these are restricted to limestone habitat and either endemic to Perlis or to Sarawak. Knowledge and data obtained from the field observation over the past 8 years leads us to report that at least 15 species endemic to limestone has become rare in the wild in Perlis, Bau and Padawan Sarawak. This was mainly attributed by: i) lack of emphasis by the government on understanding and protecting biodiversity in this kind of habitat; ii) lack of scientists willing to do research in dangerous and disaster prone limestone habitat; and iii) lack of knowledge and awareness among local communities on the importance of conserving and utilizing their natural resources in a sustainable manner.

N2  - The tree diversity of sub-montane and lower montane primary forests is studied in plot-based inventories on two sites in Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi. Out of 166 species in total, 50 % are new records for Sulawesi (19 %) or the Central Sulawesi province (31 %). Species richness decreases with altitude. In the submontane forest, the highest Family Importance Values (FIV) are reached by the Lauraceae, Fagaceae, Sapotaceae, Moraceae and Euphorbiaceae. In the lower montane forest, the Fagaceae are of major importance (FIV 71.9), followed at some distance by the Myrtaceae, Elaeocarpaceae and Lauraceae. For each site, a group of important families is identified that is of minor importance or absent on the other site. The comparison of basal area (BA), number of species and FIV with published plot-based studies in sub-montane and lower montane primary forests in Malesia (Borneo, Sulawesi, Papua New Guinea) reveals: 1) with 35.4 and 37.1 m² ha-1, the BA is comparable to that measured in Borneo and Papua New Guinea, but does not support previous findings of extremely high BA in Sulawesi forests; 2) species richness is comparable to that in Borneo and other Sulawesi forests, but lower than in Papua New Guinea; 3) decrease in diversity with altitude is in accordance with findings in Borneo; 4) in sub-montane forests, the Lauraceae are generally important; the Sulawesi studies are closely related to those from Papua New Guinea; 5) the lower montane forests have the Fagaceae and Myrtaceae as most important families in common.

N2  - This paper describes a new technique for inventory of permanent plots in tropical forests and presents the results of its application in a 1 ha permanent plot in a lowland dipterocarp forest at Kuala Belalong, Ulu Temburong National Park, Brunei Darussalam. The technique is based on mapping of positions of tree individuals in three-dimensional space with a high accuracy. Measuring set consists of a distance measuring device (laser rangefinder) and a electronic compass supplying data to a field computer with specialized software (Field-Map®). This method is faster and more exact than methods based on Cartesian grids established in the field. As an example, inventories from 2000 and 2007 of the plot mentioned are compared concerning presence, taxonomical identity and diameter at breast height (dbh) of all tree individuals with dbh ≥ 5 cm. The structural and diversity properties of the forest show similar patterns to the other two permanent plots in Kuala Belalong. In 2007, 1 318 trees were found, out of which 116 were new individuals (i.e. exceeded the 5 cm dbh limit since 2000), 13 were dead individuals. 120 trees died since 2000 (9.2 % of the trees recorded in 2000). Total basal area was 39.18 m2 (0.2 m2 were dead individuals).Growth dynamics has distinct spatial patterns: about half of the plot shows fast dbh increment in 2000–2007 and appearance of numerous new trees; the other half displays stagnation. This is probably due to topographic conditions and partly to the gap dynamics (several dominant trees have fallen there since 2000). Concerning the taxonomic composition, 47 families were recorded, the dominant ones in terms of basal area being Dipterocarpaceae, Myrtaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Sapotaceae and Burseraceae (sorted in decreasing order). The Dipterocarp family accounts for about 40 % of the total dbh. The most frequent ones were trees of Euphorbiaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Myrtaceae, Burseraceae and Anacardiaceae. However, this census concerns mainly trees with dbh ≥ 10 cm, while the rest (dbh 5 –10 cm) remained partly undetermined until 2007.

N2  - A quantitative study of floristic composition and vegetation structure was conducted at Bangka Island, Indonesia. Six different vegetation types were chosen, riparian forest, abandoned farmland, and natural regeneration of tin-mined lands of different ages: 0 and barren, 7, 11 and 38 years’ old tin-mined land. The seedling composition of the oldest tin-mined land was less than 2 % similar to that of a riparian forest. Natural regeneration on 7-year old tin-mined land began with herb species belonging to Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Melastomaceae; followed by herb species belonging to Asteraceae and Poaceae on 11-year old; then by Poaceae and shrub species of Myrtaceae on 38-year old tin-mined land. Older tin-mined land tended to have less sand, higher nutrients and cation-exchange capacity. The phosphate solubilizing bacteria showed a gradual increase along with the more newly abandoned tin-mined land but decreased in barren tin-mined land, while the number of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores showed the opposite.

Species numbers in both families seem highest in Australia and Papua New Guinea, but some potentially rich regions are much undercollected. The numbers of local endemics are also highest in these areas, at least in the Pyrenulaceae, and remarkably high for lichens. Even more surprising is the near absence of species confined to two adjacent regions.

N2  - Geology provides the basis for understanding distributions of faunas and floras in Southeast Asia but only via a complex interplay of plate movements, palaeogeography, ocean circulation and climate. Southeast Asia grew incrementally by the addition of continental fragments, mainly rifted from Australia, and added to the margins of Sundaland as a result of subduction. Sundaland was an almost permanent land area from the beginning of the Mesozoic. The addition of the continental fragments of Southwest Borneo and later East Java–West Sulawesi formed a much larger emergent land area by the Late Cretaceous that extended from Indochina to West Sulawesi.Subduction resumed at the Sundaland margin in the Eocene and this led to widespread rifting within Sundaland, and formed one of the most important barriers at its edge, the Makassar Straits. Australia began to collide with Southeast Asia about 25 million years ago, effectively closing the former deep ocean separating the two continents, and forming the region now known as Wallacea. Collision, volcanism, and subduction-related processes have led to rise of mountains but also formed new oceans within this complex region. Plate tectonic movements and collisions were intimately linked to changing topography, bathymetry and land/sea distributions which have in turn influenced oceanic circulation and climate. As the deep-water barrier between Australia and Southeast Asia was eliminated and mountains rose, deep marine basins also formed. Eustatic changes in sea level further contributed to a complex palaeogeography. The present gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans is the only low latitude oceanic passage between the world’s oceans, and is an important influence on local and probably global climate.The gateway is likely to have been just as significant in the past. Understanding the geology, then palaeogeography, and then their oceanic and climatic consequences are vital steps on the way to interpreting present distributions of plants and animals.

N2  - For numerous scientific purposes collection records need to be georeferenced. Although the geographic coordinates of many of the collection localities are available in gazetteers, especially collections from tropical areas of the world are still not georeferenced. In an attempt to georeference these localities for Indonesian Borneo we used digitized old maps which were georegistered with SRTM digital elevation data, and Landsat 7- and JERS-1 SAR radar satellite images. This enabled us to georeference 2 577 additional collections from Indonesian Borneo, belonging to 1 744 taxa, which were collected at 134 previously not georeferenced localities. This applied methodology enables researchers to georeference their historical collections for biodiversity, biogeographical, and global climate change impact studies.

N2  - Distribution patterns or the recognition of phytogeographical areas is usually based on the presence and absence of species. The taxa on which the analyses are based remain virtually anonymous. Here we want to determine which Malesian plant families (within the sample) are responsible for species richness and composition patterns. The other aim is to determine whether the different islands groups in Southeast Asia can be grouped into separate phytogeographical areas. A Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO) showed the presence of three phytogeographical areas within Malesia: The Sunda Shelf (Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo) in the west, the Sahul Shelf (New Guinea) in the east, and all remaining central areas forming Wallacea. The latter can be divided into two parts (Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands versus the Philippines, Sulawesi and the Moluccas). Only twenty plant families (out of 164 sampled) account for most of the biodiversity on the island groups, both in total and endemic species numbers. These twenty families show a limited number of species richness patterns that are significantly associated with one or several of the detected phytogeographical areas. Only a few plant families were equally common throughout the whole Malesian region. Conservation efforts in Malesia should take this spatial distribution pattern into account in order to maximise preservation of both species diversity and complementarity.

In 1935 and 1936, Hilde Schröter and Hubert Winkler proposed the following four subgenera: subg. Elatostema, subg. Elatostematoides, subg. Pellionia and subg. Weddellia, while maintaining Procris as a distinct genus. More recently, Wang (1980a) rejected Schröter and Winkler’s subgeneric classification of Elatostema and proposed a sectional and serial infrageneric classification of recognising as sections Androsyce, Elatostema, Laevisperma, Pellionioides and Weddellia (as ‘Weddelia’). He maintained both Pellionia and Procris as distinct genera. All previous researchers of Elatostema and related taxa primarily based their classifications on the morphology of leaves, stipules, inflorescence and receptacle. Our analysis, based on similar morphological characters, does not support the previous infrageneric classifications. Procris forms a monophyletic clade, nested within a clade consisting of several species of Elatostema subg. Pellionia and one of subg. Elatostematoides. Elatostema auriculatifolium (subgeneric classification unclear) is also included within this clade. This clade is sister to the E. latifolium–E. tsoongii pair of species (also subg. Pellionia), subg. Elatostema (the remaining species of this subgenus), species of subg. Weddellia and E. rostratum (subg. Elatostematoides).Elatostema subg. Weddellia is paraphyletic within subg. Elatostema. The recognition of Elatostematoides, Pellionia and Procris as distinct genera is not supported.

N2  - Alseodaphne, Dehaasia and Nothaphoebe are, morphologically, three closely related genera belonging to the Persea subgroup of the Lauraceae. A total of 214 binomials of the three genera have been published by various authors (International Plant Names Index, March 2007), of which 44 have been attributed to species occurring in Borneo. In revising the Lauraceae for the Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak Project, we recognize 40 distinct species (i.e., Alseodaphne 11; Dehaasia 16; and Nothaphoebe 13) for Sabah and Sarawak. These include 34 previously known and 6 undescribed species. Despite many attempts by various authors (Rohwer 1993, 2000, Van der Werff  Richter 1996, Van der Werff 2001) to clarify the generic delimitation between these three genera, to date there remains to be no satisfactory solution. In the absence of a well-accepted generic delimitation and classification within the Lauraceae as a whole, and for the purpose of preparing revision of the Lauraceae for the Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak, we have opted for recognising Alseodaphne, Dehaasia and Nothaphoebe as distinct genera. The distinguishing morphological characters of these three genera, based on specimens from Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak, in particular) are presented.

Herpetospermum operculatum was previously confused with Herpetospermum (= Biswarea) tonglense, but differs primarily in having smooth yellow-striped fruit with operculum at stylar end, ascendent seed arrangement in fruit and prominent probracts and bracts. At least a part of the collections of Herpetospermum tonglense in Myanmar and China represent misidentification of this species.

Qualitative and quantitative spore and macro-morphological characters were evaluated using principal component analyses to distinguish the new taxon. Our results suggest that the perispore with leasura, lamina width, rhizome diameter, blade dissection and number of pinnae are important characters to distinguish S. × manizalense. This is the ﬁrst record of a hybrid between a simple and pinnate-leaved species in Serpocaulon, which is considered to be Critically Endangered (CR).

Cladopus javanicus and C. nymanii are endemic to Java and Malesia, respectively, and C. queenslandicus occurs in eastern Papua New Guinea and north-eastern Australia. Terniopsis malayana, formerly called Malaccotristicha malayana, is distributed in Peninsular Malaysia to Peninsular Thailand. Asian Podostemoideae including Cladopus are a product of secondary diversification following a single migration, while Tristichoideae with Terniopsis show primary diversification in Asia.

Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis were conducted on the dataset in order to establish a robust phylogenetic relationship between taxa. The results of analysis indicate incongruence with morphological classification. All genera of Davalliaceae in the study area are paraphyletic except Araiostegia which is represented by only a single species. In addition it partially agrees with recent phylogeny base on rbcL data.

N2  - Aglaia elaeagnoidea is the most widespread and one of the more morphologically diverse complex species in the largest genus of the mahogany family (Meliaceae, Sapindales). We performed maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses (nuclear ITS rDNA) to estimate genetic relations among samples of Aglaia elaeagnoidea, and their phylogenetic position within Aglaia (more than 120 species in Indomalesia, Australasia, and the Pacific islands). Based on 90 accessions of Melioideae (ingroup) and four taxa of Cedreloideae (outgroup), this study 1) provides a first assessment of the genetic diversity of Aglaia elaeagnoidea; 2) investigates the geographic structure of the data in selected eastern and western regions of its distribution; and 3) suggests that Australia has been colonized only recently by A. elaeagnoidea and other species within the genus (Miocene/Pliocene boundary to Pliocene). Based on DNA data, morphology and additional evidence derived from biogenetic trends (secondary metabolites), the name Aglaia roxburghiana could be reinstated for specimens from the western end (India, Sri Lanka), but we have no data yet to indicate definitely where A. roxburghiana ends and A. elaeagnoidea begins either morphologically or geographically. Viewed in a more general context, Aglaieae are an ideal model group for obtaining more insights into the origin and evolution of Indomalesian and Australian biotas.

N2  - Traditionally most species of Grammitidaceae have been placed in three genera, Ctenopteris, Grammitis and Xiphopteris, defined by frond dissection. Grammitis has simple fronds, usually with one row of sori on each side of the midrib. Xiphopteris has lobed to pinnate fronds, and one row of sori on each side of the midrib or rachis. Ctenopteris has fronds deeply lobed to tripinnate, with more than one row of sori on each side of the midrib or rachis. There are problems with the usage of these three names: Grammitis is now defined to include only those species with a dark sclerotic frond border, the type species of Xiphopteris has been transferred to Cochlidium, and the type species of Ctenopteris belongs to Prosaptia. In both the Old World and the New World, new genera have been or will be published to accommodate species from these three genera. The new genera relevant to Malesia are discussed.

N2  - Hoya with perhaps 300 species is one of the most diverse angiosperm genera in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia and New Guinea. Knowledge of the number of species and their relationships is still very unsatisfactory.Floral characters have been used to subdivide the genus into sections, although none of these groups were based on phylogenetic relationships. Recently, molecular phylogenetic studies have shed new light on the intrageneric relationships of the genus by identifying three main monophyletic clades, in addition to a core Hoya group that includes most of the species examined. One clade includes New Guinean/Australian species, while the other two, the Acanthostemma and the Eriostemma clades, mainly correspond to existing sections. I here discuss the phylogenetic findings in the light of the traditional morphological classifications, as a first step towards a new classification of Hoya based on phylogenetic relationships.

N2  - Species of Euphrasia are distributed in both hemispheres with a series of connecting localities on the mountain peaks of Taiwan and the Malesian region including Luzon, Borneo, Sulawesi, Seram and New Guinea.Two hypotheses are proposed to explain this distribution pattern. The Northern Hemisphere might have been the centre of origin or the Southern Hemisphere. This study aims to reconstruct the core phylogeny of Euphrasia in the connecting areas and tries to identify the migratory direction of Euphrasia in Taiwan and Malesia. The phylogeny of Euphrasia, including sections Euphrasia, Malesianae and Pauciflorae, is reconstructed with the chloroplast molecular markers rps2 gene, trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer. The results suggest that the migratory direction between Taiwan and the Philippines is possibly from the north to the south. However, the migratory direction within section Malesianae and the centre of origin of Euphrasia remain unanswered from our data. More data is needed to clarify this issue.

N2  - The term Milne Bay Archipelago is used to include Goodenough, Fergusson and Normanby Islands – collectively the d’Entrecasteau Islands, the islands of the Louisiade Archipelago, Missima, Rossel and Sudest Islands and the two northern islands, the Trobriands and Woodlark. All are very complex with many small islands, often unnamed. Due to their geographic isolation the islands have many endemic species. So far 139 have been described. Of particular interest is the genus Rosselia, collected only twice from Rossel Island. This monotypic genus was placed, with many questions, in the Burseraceae and its current position is uncertain. Another neoendemic genus in Milne Bay is Lamiodendendron. It is a coastal tree scattered on several islands and also coastally on the mainland of the Milne Bay Province. A single collection has been made from the Northern Province. The islands are very poorly known and with continuing collections more endemic species can be expected.

N2  - The genus Oxalis in southern Africa contains more than 200 species, with the vast bulk of species in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR). Recent ﬁeldwork has suggested that many await discovery. Here we investigate the identity of two apparently undescribed Oxalis species from Northern Cape, South Africa, using morphological comparisons with closely related taxa. We provide a preliminary phylogenetic placement using DNA sequence-based analyses of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region. Both putative new species are distinguished from all known Oxalis species based on macro-morphological traits. Molecular data placed both within a clade consisting of the weedy O. pes-caprae and its close relatives. Oxalis hirsutibulba sp. nov. is characterised by densely hairy bulb tunics, a trait absent from all known members of the O. pes-caprae clade. Oxalis fenestrata sp. nov. is unique in producing apple green succulent stems and leaflets usually with translucent white markings at their incisions. We also provide the ﬁrst phylogenetic placement of the GCFR narrow endemic O. lasiorrhiza in the O. pes-caprae clade. In conjunction with several other recent discoveries, these two new species and the phylogenetic placement of O. lasiorrhiza show that the O. pes-caprae clade is much more speciose than previously estimated.

Out of the 39 recorded species of sect. Diploclinium, 32 have been found back in the wild. Three new species have been discovered, as well as four possible subspecies of Begonia nigritarum (Kamel) Steud. Most species occur in a single locality and the numbers of individuals are small. With rampant logging and unchecked quarrying, many species are threatened by habitat disturbance or destruction.

N2  - The highest mountains in South-East Asia are in the Sudirman range of Indonesian New Guinea; the highest is Mt Jaya which rises to 4 884 m and is still partly glaciated. The geological history of the region has left it rich in mineral deposits and the alpine area is currently being mined for copper. In 1997 a project was initiated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in conjunction with the mining companies Rio Tinto and PT-Freeport Indonesia, to study the region’s flora. An introduction to the region, including geology, glaciation and past exploration will be given, as well as the history and objectives of the Kew project. During the project, Kew made several collaborative expeditions to the area, as well as a database of all historical collections from Mt Jaya. Collection patterns for different habitats have been analysed and show that the alpine areas have been adequately collected, but montane areas are still under-collected. A summary of the recently published floristic treatment of the c. 750 species found above 3 000 m, including many endemics, is presented, and the fern and fern allies are discussed in greater detail.The flora of Mt Jaya, as well as other tropical alpine floras, is under threat from mining activities and climate change, and these will be briefly discussed.

N2  - The moss flora of Mindoro Island was updated based on the 2004–2006 expeditions conducted by the author. The island’s moss flora now consists of 282 species in 128 genera and 39 families, which is higher than Palawan but far less than those of Luzon and Mindanao. Generally, the flora is most abundant in the eastern rainy part of the island, especially along mid-elevations on the east-facing slope of the central mountain range in the transition zone between montane and mossy forests. Moss diversity is also greater in riverine forests than in inland forests at low elevations. Only three moss taxa, Rhaccocarpus alpinus, Dicranoloma daymannianum and Distichophyllum noguchianum, have their Philippine range restricted to the island. Distichophyllum noguchianum is a Philippine endemic. Floristically, the Mindoro moss flora is identified more with Luzon within the Philippine archipelago, while its sharing of other widespread Malesian taxa reinforced its role as an integral component of the Malesian flora. Reports of taxa with Australasian affinity show growing evidence for a Gondwanan influence on the island moss flora, although a tenuous one. Likewise, the presence of moss taxa such as Acroporium johanneswinkleri, Cryptogonium phyllogonioides and Glyptothecium sciuroides in Mindoro, reinforce the important role of Palawan as link in the exchange of biota between Mindoro, Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia during the Pleistocene.Finally, the importance of the island in enriching the Philippine flora and the necessity to protect its remaining forests are discussed.

N2  - The known lichen diversity of Singapore, 296 species, is comparable with temperate lowland areas, but the taxa involved are different, even at high taxonomic levels: the commonest orders are Arthoniales and Graphidales instead of Lecanorales. Epiphytic species dominate, while saxicolous and terrestrial species are rare. Comparison with pre-2000 records and non-urbanized areas suggests a decrease in forest lichens, cyanophilous macrolichens, and the nitrophilous family Physciaceae.

N2  - A Checklist of Guinea-Bissau’s vascular flora is presented, based on the inventory of herbarium material and on recent collections. In addition to the name, we cite for each taxon the basionym and synonyms, the life form and habitat, as well as the chorology, Raunkiaer’s biological type, phenology and vernacular names if known. 1507 specific and infra-specific taxa were recorded, of which 1459 are autochthonous, belonging to 696 genera. This shows a higher diversity than the 1000 species estimated so far. In the autochthonous flora there are 22 species of Pteridophyta from 14 families; 1041 taxa of Dicotyledons from 107 families, and 396 taxa of Monocotyledons belonging to 33 families. Three taxa are probably endemic to the country.

It most closely resembles R. lobata and R. manillana in perigone colour and wart ornamentations and in the wide aperture relative to diaphragm diameter. It is, however, different from both of these and other Philippine Rafflesia species in its flower size and disk that lacks or has rudimentary processes.

N2  - Age and the greenness of leaves have been frequently used as indicators for selecting herbarium specimens for molecular studies. Although plant DNA extraction and amplification have been common lab procedures for the past 20 years, no studies specifically investigated the success of these indicators.Here the predictive value of age and the greenness for extraction and amplification success is assessed, using a large number of herbarium specimens from different plant groups. The investigation of these indicators is important because herbarium material is a precious commodity, and is often the only remaining floral record of now extinct ecosystems. In cases where little leaf material is available, most researchers still attempt to extract DNA. This study shows that age and greenness of leaves are unreliable indicators of extraction and amplification success, although together they can have limited usefulness. Furthermore, we found that the amount of extracted DNA from herbarium specimens decreases with c. 1% per year in age of the specimens. Therefore, researchers sometimes should refrain from using old rare specimens because chances of success are unpredictable and precious herbarium material might be wasted. The uncritical use of indicators such as age or leaf colour is therefore not recommendable. Furthermore, botanists should annotate how specimens were collected and dried because this information is essential for successful DNA extraction. Hopefully, similar studies will be reported in order to identify the best approaches to extract DNA from herbarium specimens.

N2  - A large amount of unidentified material of the Neotropical genus Guatteria (Annonaceae) is lying on herbarium shelves around the world. Here twelve species are described in an attempt to reduce this amount of unidentified material. Next to this, previously unidentified material is now assigned to G. asplundiana, G. microcarpa, G. pastazae, and G. scalarinervia, four previously described but poorly known species, thus providing a clearer circumscription of these species. Furthermore, G. discolor and G. megalophylla appear to have a wider distribution than previously thought. Lastly, G. macrantha, a curious species only known from the type, is excluded from the genus and referred to Uvaria. With the description of twelve new species and the synonymizing of one, the total number of species in Guatteria adds up to over 300, thus rivalling Inga (Fabaceae) and Ocotea (Lauraceae) for the status of largest genus of Neotropical trees.

N2  - Colletoecema magna, a new species from the Ngovayang Massif (southern Cameroon) is described and illustrated. A comparative morphological study illustrates the similar placentation and fruit anatomy of the novelty and Colletoecema dewevrei, the only other species of the genus. Colletoecema magna essentially differs from C. dewevrei by its sessile flowers and fruits, the corolla tube that is densely hairy above the insertion point of the stamens and the anthers that are included. Further characters that separate the novelty are its larger leaves, more condensed inflorescences, and larger fruits. Its position within Colletoecema is corroborated by atpB-rbcL and rbcL chloroplast sequences. The relationships among the basal lineages of the subfamily Rubioideae, to which Colletoecema belongs, are briefly addressed. Based on our present knowledge, a paleotropical or tropical African origin of the Rubioideae is hypothesized.

However, the morphology is rather uniform. The four species recognised by A.C. Smith had to be synonymised, but a new taxon deserved recognition. The name Bubbia is explained.

N2  - This paper surveys the medicinal plants and their traditional use by local people in Ben En National Park, Vietnam. A total of 230 medicinal plant species (belonging to 200 genera and 84 families) is used by local people for treatment of 68 different diseases. These include species that are collected in the wild (65%) as well as species grown in home gardens. Leaves, stems and roots are most commonly used either fresh or dried or by decocting the dried parts in water. Women are mainly responsible for health care, they have better knowledge of medicinal plants than men, and also collect them more than men at almost every age level. The indigenous knowledge of traditional medicinal plants may be rapidly lost because 43% of the young generation do not know or do not want to learn about medicinal plants, and the remainder knows little about them. Moreover, nowadays local people tend to use western medicine. Eighteen medicinal plant species are commercialized and contribute on average 11% to the income of the households. The majority of medicinal species are used by less than half of the households and 68% of the medicinal plant species have use indices lower than 0.25.Only 6 of the medicinal species of Ben En are listed in the Red data list of Vietnam, but locally 18 medicinal species are endangered because of overharvesting.A comparison of traditional uses of medicinal plants in Ben En National Park with traditional uses elsewhere in South-East Asia and the Indo-Pacific region shows that the same species may be used for widely different treatments by different ethnic groups.The conservation, sustainable use and economic potential of medicinal plants is discussed. We argue that their use, cultivation in home gardens, and marketing should be encouraged as an affordable alternative to expensive western medicine.

N2  - For decades, the rare Malesian shrublet hitherto called Turraea breviflora, was the only species of the pantropical family Meliaceae which could not confidently be placed in a genus. Previous morphological re-investigation led to the exclusion of the species from Turraea and suggested possibly close links with Munronia. In this study, parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses ofDNAsequence data from plastid rbcL and nuclear ITS rDNA were used to infer the phylogenetic position of T. breviflora and its affinities to other representatives of the family. Phylogenetic analyses support Mabberley’s (1995a) proposal that the concept of the genus Munronia be expanded to accommodate it. The new combination Munronia breviflora (Ridl.) Mabb.  Muellner is therefore made.

N2  - The genus Stenocephalum (Vernonieae, Asteraceae) includes six South American species that have cylindrical heads, 4–11 florets by capitula, cymose inflorescences and type ‘C’ pollen. Until now, Stenocephalum monticola has been considered as a synonym of S. apiculatum. However, the analysis of the type material and additional specimens indicate that it is a quite different species, which differs in leaf size, pubescence and capitula arrangement. Stenocephalum monticola has leaves of 9–20 mm long, leaf blades villous at the base and capitula agglomerate at the stems tips, while S. apiculatum presents leaves of 30–60 mm long, leaf blades basally glabrous and heads mostly solitary, arranged in a pseudo-spiciform inflorescence. Consequently, in this paper S. monticola is resurrected from the synonymy of S. apiculatum, re-described and illustrated.

N2  - The range of diagnostic morphological features in the whole genus Mallotus is reviewed as background to the taxonomic treatment of section Rottleropsis s.l. Special emphasis is given to the indumentum, habit, stipules, leaves, extrafloral nectaries, domatia, inflorescences, flowers, pollen and fruits. Notes on the geographical distribution, ecology, pollinators, fruit and seed dispersal, and uses of the genus are also presented. The section Axenfeldia is reduced to sect. Rottleropsis on account of the absence of suitable morphological characters to distinguish them. A taxonomic revision of 38 species of sect.Rottleropsis s.l. from Malesia, Thailand and Africa is presented, together with regional and synoptical identification keys, distribution maps and illustrations. Four new species are described: Mallotus connatus, M. longinervis, M. minimifructus and M. mirus. Several non-Malesian species not included in this revision are briefly discussed. This paper concludes a series of taxonomic revisions of the genus Mallotus in Malesia and Thailand.

N2  - A recent molecular phylogenetic study of Mallotus and related genera showed that three small Asiatic genera are clearly part of a strongly supported main Mallotus clade (Mallotus s.s. clade), rendering the genus paraphyletic. In this paper these genera, Neotrewia, Octospermum and Trewia, are merged with Mallotus. The monotypic Neotrewia and Octospermum were originally described within Mallotus and are now transferred back to it. Trewia was never included in Mallotus; it has two distinct species, for which new combinations within Mallotus are made. A full taxonomic treatment with descriptions, distribution maps and drawings is given for the species transferred, and a new generic description for Mallotus is provided. The morphology of the newly transferred species in comparison to Mallotus in general and to related species in particular is discussed.

N2  - Cyathea lamoureuxii is described from recent exploratory surveys in Papua New Guinea. The new fern is unique among eastern Malesian congeners for its undivided pinnae, and is also the only member of its subgenus with manifestly pinnate leaves. The manner in which the novelty combines diagnostic features across infrageneric lines underscores the difficulties in drawing absolute separations at the subgenus and sectional levels.

N2  - Recent molecular studies have revealed that the genus Cucumis in its current circumscription is paraphyletic. To become monophyletic, Cucumis must include five genera of the subtribe Cucumerinae, namely Cucumella, Dicoelospermum, Mukia, Myrmecosicyos, and Oreosyce, already regarded as closely related by earlier workers based on morphology. The 19 species in the five genera are here formally transferred to Cucumis, resulting in 14 new combinations, two changes in status, and three new names (Cucumis indicus, C. kirkbrideana, and C. oreosyce). A description of the genus and a key to its 52 species are given, and the subgenera and sections are recircumscribed to reflect monophyletic groups. Subgenus Humifructus, with a haploid chromosome number of 12, contains only C. humifructus and C. hirsutus, while subgenus Cucumis, with n = 12 or n = 7, contains the remainder of the species. The latter is further divided into the sections Aculeatosi, Cucumella, Cucumis, Metuliferi, and Sagittati.

N2  - Recently, N. baramensis and N. rafflesiana var. subglandulosa were described from Borneo as new taxa closely related to N. rafflesiana. However, comparison of new collections made in Borneo with N. baramensis and N. rafflesiana var. subglandulosa indicated a synonymy. Furthermore, they were identical to N. hemsleyana, an older taxon formerly treated as synonym of N. rafflesiana. Acknowledging the taxonomic differences to N. rafflesiana, the name N. hemsleyana is reinstated following the priority rule. New evidence is presented that strengthens the interpretation to split N. rafflesiana and N. hemsleyana.

N2  - The African genus Heckeldora (Meliaceae) is revised. Contrary to earlier views the widespread and variable H. staudtii is shown to consist of four distinct entities, each worthy of specific status.Heckeldora zenkeri is therefore re-instated and two other species, originally described in the much larger genus Guarea, and formerly also considered conspecific with H. staudtii, are resurrected and formally transferred to Heckeldora. In addition, two new species, H. jongkindii J.J. de Wilde from Liberia and H. trifoliolata J.J. de Wilde from Gabon are recognized and described. Heckeldora mangenotiana is transferred to Guarea and the new combination made. A key to the six Heckeldora species now recognized is provided and maps of their distribution are presented.

N2  - Taxonomic study of morphological variability using multivariate analysis, together with field studies and literature review clarified the status of a number of paired species of Saurauia and Actinidia of Vietnam and resolved their correct nomenclature: Saurauia tristyla is different from S. roxburghii; Saurauia petelotii is not a synonym of S. fasciculata but is a separate species; Actinidia tonkinensis is a synonym of A. latifolia; Actinidia indochinensis is a distinct species, not a variety of A. callosa; Saurauia dillenioides is a synonym of S. armata; and Saurauia griffithii var. annamica is a synonym of S. napaulensis. Four taxa of Actinidia are newly recorded for Vietnam. The results of this study will allow us to better understand the conservation status of species of Actinidiaceae in Vietnam.

N2  - (Annonaceae). The closeness of these three genera was expressed by Fries when he placed them in his (informal) Unonopsis group (Fries, 1959), and the close relationship is supported by more recent phylogenetic research as well. Four species are recognized in Bocageopsis and two species in Onychopetalum.Unonopsis is by far the largest of the three genera with close to 50 species, of which no less than 23 species are here described as new. One species (Unonopsis umbilicata) had to be shelved as insufficiently known for lack of data, and another, obviously new, species from Colombia is too incomplete and is described provisionally as Unonopsis spec. A.Several keys are provided, one for the genera and one each for the species of Bocageopsis and Onychopetalum. For the species of Unonopsis a key to all species and, in addition, a key to the species of Mexico and Central America are provided. The species treatments include full descriptions, geographical and ecological notes, distribution maps, synonymy, taxonomic notes, and vernacular names. A complete list of exsiccatae is appended.Parallel to the taxonomic revision, a leaf anatomical survey was made by E.-J. van Marle, and is included here.

N2  - A small fig tree has been misidentified as Ficus orthoneura for a long time. However, morphologically it is distinct from F. orthoneura and F. hookeriana. Typical are the ellipsoid, puberulous receptacle and caducous basal bracts. Leaf anatomy shows a multiple epidermis with the cells in the inner layer much larger than in the outer layer and thus both layers resemble an epidermis with a separate hypodermis. The abaxial cuticle is strongly sculptured, the palisade layer shows some long subdivided cells, and enlarged lithocysts are only present abaxially.Because of these differences we hereby describe it as a new species, named in honour of Cornelis (Cees) Berg: Ficus cornelisiana.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships of Dioscorea, including sections Botryosicyos, Combilium, Enantiophyllum, Lasiophyton, Opsophyton, Shannicorea and Stenophora, are reconstructed with chloroplast trnL-F, matK, rbcL and atpB-rbcL sequence data, covering a total of 72 accessions including 48 ingroup species and five outgroup species from East and Southeast Asia. The seven Asian sections do reflect the genetic relationships among the species that they include. In summary, D. sect. Combilium and sect. Shannicorea are recognized as closely related sections with moderate support. The results also support Burkills treatment of subsect. Euopsophyton (D. bulbifera) as sect. Opsophyton and subsect. Macrourae (D. sansibarensis) as sect. Macroura. In addition, there is a well-supported sister relationship between D. sect. Lasiophyton and sect. Botryosicyos. The level of morphological characters and molecular divergence within D. sect. Enantiophyllum is low, but the members of this group could still be distinguished from each other.

N2  - Morphological and anatomical studies of leaves of two closely related Cardiospermum species from South America, C. procumbens and C. pterocarpum, were assayed. Both species have amphistomatic leaves, anomocytic stomata, non-glandular and glandular trichomes, secretory cells present in the epidermis and mesophyll, bifacial structure, and the cuticle showing concentric striae around the stomata. Tunnel-type domatia were found in C. procumbens, at laminar base at the junction of the three principal veins on the adaxial surface. These domatia are interpreted as an apomorphic character for the genus and tribe within the Sapindaceae. In C. pterocarpum domatia are exceptionally present.This is the first record of adaxial domatia in Sapindaceae.

All analyses supported a group of genera which can be recognised at the subfamily level: Anacardioideae. Sequence data and combined datasets supported the recognition of a second subfamily: Spondiadioideae Kunth emend. Wannan. Both datasets also suggested that Buchanania lies outside both subfamily groups.

N2  - Two additional species of Lessingianthus (Vernonieae, Asteraceae) from the Brazilian highlands are described and illustrated. One of the new species, Lessingianthus barrosoanus, is characterized by the presence of solitary heads disposed in relatively long, flexuous branches. It has certain resemblance to L. ligulifolius (Mart. ex DC.) H. Rob., which has short, commonly erect branches of the inflorescence, and capitula geminate or disposed in groups. Lessingianthus minimus is closely related to L. reitzianus (Cabrera) H. Rob., but differs in having acuminate phyllaries, glabrous corolla lobes and lanceolate leaves, cuneate at the base.

N2  - Magnolia biondii var. purpurascens var. nov. and Magnolia cylindrica var. purpurascens var. nov. (Magnoliaceae) are described as two new varieties endemic to China. Magnolia biondii var. purpurascens is mainly restricted to forests of Shaanxi and SE Gansu provinces. It differs from the typical variety, M. biondii var. biondii, in the dense indumentum of white hairs on twigs and the cup-shaped purplish red flowers. Magnolia cylindrica var. purpurascens occurs in secondary forests of Jingning and Songyang counties of southern Zhejiang province. It differs from the typical variety, M. cylindrica var. cylindrica, in the cup-shaped flowers of purplish red colour. The two new varieties are distinct in their distributions in both cases but share the chromosome numbers with their typical varieties. Magnolia biondii var. purpurascens is a diploid with 2n = 38, whereas M. cylindrica var. purpurascens is a tetraploid with 2n = 76.

N2  - A recent phylogenetic study based on DNA sequence data detected a well-supported clade of a number of Mallotus species together with the genus Cordemoya. This clade is distinct from the large Mallotus s.s. clade. In this paper, Cordemoya (formerly monotypic with C. integrifolia from the Mascarene Islands) is expanded with sixteen additional species previously assigned to Mallotus. Taxa transferred to Cordemoya are: Mallotus sections Hancea and Oliganthae from Asia and M. baillonianus, M. capuronii, and M. spinulosus from Madagascar. The genus Cordemoya can be distinguished from Mallotus s.s. by the presence of pollen with areolate ornamentation with scabrae (perforate/microreticulate ornamentation with scabrae in the sample of Mallotus s.s. studied up to now) and of capitate glandular hairs with multicellular stalks and sessile peltate-stellate hairs with a central cell (spherical to disc-shaped multicellular glandular hairs in Mallotus). In the new circumscription of Cordemoya two subgenera are recognized: Cordemoya from Madagascar and Mascarenes and Diplochlamys from Asia. The latter is divided into two sections: Diplochlamys (former sect. Hancea), and Oliganthae.A taxonomic revision of part of these taxa is provided (excl. section Diplochlamys); descriptions, distribution maps, habit drawings and a key are included.

N2  - Phylogenetic relationships among 24 genera of Rosaceae subfam. Maloideae and Spiraeoideae are explored by means of a cladistic analysis; 16 morphological and anatomical characters were included in the analysis. Published suprageneric classifications and characters used in these classifications are briefly reviewed. Additionally, some new features are here reported, such as seed shape, presence or absence of endosperm, and number of cell layers in the seed coat and in the endosperm. Parsimony analyses indicate that Eriobotrya and Rhaphiolepis form a well-supported clade that is the sister to the remainder of the subfamily. This result is in agreement with published ITS sequence data. Other clades are not supported, with the exception of the group Amelanchier–Peraphyllum–Malacomeles. Results of several studies point toward North America as centre of origin for Maloideae, considering the distribution of closely related Spiraeoideae such as Vauquelinia and Lindleia. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of Takhtajan’s biogeographic regions was carried out using presence/ absence of genera as characters. Eastern Asia is a centre of diversity from which the number of shared taxa decreases in several directions. This can be associated with the retreat of many taxa belonging to the Early Tertiary tropical-subtropical flora towards the refuges of China, Indochina and Malaysia, after wet-temperate forests were progressively transformed during the Neogene, which seems to be the case of Eriobotrya and Rhaphiolepis. Finally, Osteomeles and Chamaemeles were postulated as long-distance dispersion events while Hesperomeles could have originated in North America and migrated into north-western South America.

N2  - Three new species of Annonaceae from Venezuela are described here: Cremastosperma venezuelanum Pirie, Klarobelia subglobosa Chatrou, and Pseudomalmea wingfieldii Chatrou. All three are represented by few collections (in comparison to those of other Neotropical species of Annonaceae). Klarobelia subglobosa and P. wingfieldii in particular are only known from a few individual specimens collected in areas vulnerable to habitat destruction. IUCN threat categories are assigned to these species.

N2  - A survey of seaweeds was made in Eritrea in December 1995 and January 1996 on some islands of the Dahlak Archipelago and the surroundings of the port town of Massawa. During our study 101 specific and infraspecific taxa were identified, including 26 Chlorophyta, 20 Phaeophyta and 55 Rhodophyta. The survey resulted in 36 new records for Eritrea (11 Chlorophyta, 7 Phaeophyta and 18 Rhodophyta). Of these Eritrean records, 26 are new for the Red Sea (5 Chlorophyta, 4 Phaeophyta and 17 Rhodophyta). Comparison of records of seaweeds from localities in Eritrea to those from other localities in Eritrea as well as from other coasts of the western Indian Ocean have revealed that the regional distribution of seaweeds in the Red Sea is very patchy and that generally the area seems to be undersampled. The comparisons have also underscored the stressful seasonal environmental conditions for macroalgae in the southern Red Sea.

Following study of material from throughout the distribution range all previously recognised Asian taxa were considered synonymous, and therefore only one widespread species D. neilgherrensis Wight is recognised. While most plant parts are merely highly variable in their size, the structure of the lip appendage is not uniform in the Indian specimens.

N2  - The distinction between Anetholea and Syzygium is lessened due to the occurrence of epigeal germination and dry fruitedness in the latter genus also and it is concluded that Anetholea is better placed within Syzygium. Analysis of sequence data from nuclear ribosomal DNA and the chloroplast genome support this conclusion. The sole species of Anetholea, A. anisata, is transferred to Syzygium and the new combination, S. anisatum (Vickery) Craven  Biffin, made. Syzygium wilsonii subsp. cryptophlebium is reinstated at species rank, necessitating the new combination, S. cryptophlebium (F. Muell.) Craven  Biffin. Two new taxa of Syzygium are described from Australia, S. wilsonii subsp. epigaeum Craven  Biffin and S. maraca Craven  Biffin.

Eleven species are known, one of which is newly described here (C. fulvisericea), and one species is reduced to synonymy (C. producta = C. trisepala).The section is centred on Borneo, with two outlying species in Sumatra and one in Peninsular Malaysia.Section Dissimiles is defined by a unique combination of characters, the most distinctive of these are: a zygomorphic calyx (the upper three lobes are fused to form one but the tips remain free, and the lower two lobes are completely separated to the base); anisophyllous leaf pairs, and a small (generally less than 2 cm long), predominantly white, somewhat translucent corolla.

A new species, C. luziae, resembling C. javanicum, is described from the Moluccas, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. In addition, C. salomonis is synonymised with C. papuanum and C. lanceolatum is treated as a variety of C. ramosii. In total 7 Malesian Cleidion species are recognized. Cleidion megistophyllum from the Philippines cannot reliably be confirmed to belong to the genus due to lack of information and specimens and is treated as a doubtful species.

Mallotus chromocarpus is excluded from the section because it has more shared characters with the monospecific genus Octospermum, like the presence of indehiscent fruits, absence of stipules, marginal extrafloral nectaries on the upper side of the leaf blade, broad connectives (shaped umbrella-like), and its occurrence in New Guinea, and is therefore probably closely related to it.

Fibers may form discontinuous or continuous bundles associated with veins or, more rarely, occur as individual cells. Sclereids, often of the astrosclereid type, are present in varying concentrations, or may be absent.Cristarque cells are very common, and occasionally extremely abundant, but are lacking in several genera. The survey includes information on terminal tracheids which are almost invariably present.Attention is drawn to the systematic significance of sclerenchyma where warranted.

N2  - Evidence from both morphological and molecular phylogenetic data support the view that the circumscissile calycine calyptra, the sole defining character of Cleistocalyx, has multiple origins within Syzygium s. l. and is therefore an invalid basis for generic circumscription. Accordingly, the Fijian Cleistocalyx are transferred to Syzygium, and the new combinations Syzygium decussatus, S. eugenioides and S. seemannii, are made. Syzygium myrtoides is reinstated, and Cleistocalyx ellipticus, C. longiflorus, C. kasiensis and C. seemannii var. punctatus are reduced to the synonymy of S. seemannii.The distribution of S. seemannii is extended to Vanuatu.

N2  - A climbing bamboo endemic to North Queensland in Australia, previously named Bambusa moreheadiana, represents a new monotypic endemic genus there, Mullerochloa. Its clambering-scrambling, generally non-twining habit, sympodial rhizomes, inflated proximal ends of culm internodes and culm sheaths with a wrinkled basal zone, are distinctive vegetative characters. Additional important characters of the reproductive system include the iterauctant flowering habit, producing clusters of pseudospikelets, each with 4–9 flowers and a terminal vestigial flower; paleas that conspicuously exceed the lemmas in length; consistently four anthers borne on a filament tube; and a glabrous ovary.A discussion of the circumscription of the Asiatic genus Bambusa, with which a number of other distinct genera, including Mullerochloa, have been confused, is provided.

They share the unusual characteristic of quadrangular, winged stems, formerly only known from Tachia longipes in Suriname. They differ from this species in their larger, winged, keeled, and long-acuminate calyx lobes. Tachia lancisepala, spec. nov., is only known from one collection from the State of Rondônia in Brazil, and has unusually large and broadly funnelshaped corollas and ovate leaves with winged petioles. Tachia siwertii, spec. nov., has been found in three separate areas in southern Amazonas and Pará (Brazil) and is characterized by more elliptic leaves, unwinged petioles, and a narrower corolla than T. lancisepala.

In the introduction a short history of the genus (section) and its defining characters are presented followed by comments about Sleumer’s classification for this section. Numerical techniques using features suggested by Sleumer on ‘indet’ specimens at Leiden counsel a more conservative approach to species delimitation and the resultant revision for this section recognizes thirteen species including three new taxa, viz., V. crinigrum, V. suberosum, and V. linearifolium. Lectotypes for V. borneense W.W. Sm. and V. leptanthum Miq. are also proposed.

N2  - Establishing species distributions is particularly challenging in large tropical genera of inconspicuous plants. One such genus is Oberonia (Orchidaceae) which we are currently revising for Thailand. When encountering material of a putatively new species, great care has been taken to make a wide geographic search for matching extra-Thai taxa. Against this background, we here record 12 species as new for Thailand: O. dissitiflora, O. evrardii, O. gracilis, O. insectifera, O. lotsyana, O. microphylla, O. orbicularis, O. semifimbriata, O. singalangensis, O. stenophylla, O. suborbicularis, O. wenzelii. Seven records are based (at least in part) on older collections, suggesting that many gaps in currently known species distributions can be filled through revision of existing collections alone.Our wide geographic search for taxonomic matches had three important implications: 1) we succeeded in identifying five species that had not previously been recognized for Thailand or neighbouring regions; 2) we realized that circumscription of three species should be widened, with implications for their known distributions; 3) comparison of numerous collections enabled us to report additionally six new records (O. evrardii for Myanmar; O. insectifera for Papua New Guinea; O. semifimbriata for Borneo; O. wenzelii for India, Myanmar and Java). Eventually, we draw attention to new online tools and resources that facilitate improvements of taxonomic and geographic knowledge in large tropical genera.

Detailed comparisons are made with P. diplobetor and P. ciliolatus. Paepalanthus aleurophyllus is distinguished by its densely ciliated leaves with dolabriform to fusiform trichomes in the adaxial leaf surface, conspicuous venation on the abaxial leaf surface, trichomes between the scape ribs, general habit, and other floral features. We provide detailed line drawings and commentaries on distribution, ecology, and conservation.

W.J. de Wilde  Duyfjes, comb. nov., occurs in S India and Sri Lanka. The status of S. heterophylla subsp. napaulensis (Ser.) W.J. de Wilde  Duyfjes, comb.  stat. nov. needs further study as this subspecies is very similar to the more widespread subsp. heterophylla, but it is distinct by sigmoid thecae. Solena amplexicaulis is taxonomically more distinct from the other two species of Solena. In southern India Kedrostis foetidissima much resembles Solena in general habit, especially by the more or less amplexicaul leaves, and therefore it is discussed and keyed out against Solena.

N2  - Ehretia (Ehretiaceae, Boraginales) has been divided into two major clades, characterised by fruits with four endocarpids (Ehretia I, including species of Ehretia formerly belonging to Rotula) and by fruits with two endocarpids (Ehretia II, plus E. microphylla (= Carmona retusa) with an undivided endocarp), respectively. Both molecular (ITS1) and morphological data support the recognition of an additional clade, Ehretia III (E. longiflora species group). Its representatives are characterised by four endocarpids (as in Ehretia I), but differ in the presence of distinct lamellae on the abaxial surface of each endocarpid (as in Bourreria, also belonging to Ehretiaceae). However, molecular data suggest a close relationship with Ehretia II. At least three species belong to Ehretia III: Chinese E. longiflora, eastern Indian E. wallichiana, and Indonesian E. javanica.

Pedersen  Gravend., on the other hand, are unknown, but parsimony analyses of sequences of the plastid accD-psaI intergenic spacer and nuclear ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region and morphological affinities suggest they should both be counted as members of the Philippine flora.

N2  - Pimelodendron comprises five species. Four species were already known (P. amboinicum, P. griffithianum, P. macrocarpum, P. zoanthogyne). One Sumatran species is to separate in the rest of Pimelodendron without naming it (Pimelodendron spec. nov.?). One name is excluded (P. dispersum = Actephila excelsa var. javanica), while P. naumannianum is regarded as a synonym of P. amboinicum.

N2  - This is the second part of a world-wide revision of the genus Boehmeria, the previously-published part having dealt with the New World species. The Old World species are widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics from West Africa to islands in the Pacific Ocean and from Japan and China to Southern Africa, Madagascar and Australia, with the highest species richness in the Himalayas and their extension into China and Indochina. No indigenous species is common to both the Old and New World. The species represent taxonomic units of very different complexity: most species exhibit little infraspecific variation; in several others formal taxonomic infraspecific units can be recognised; however, in two, B. virgata and B. japonica, a highly complex variation is seen, fitting with difficulty into the normal hierarchy of taxonomic classification. With the conclusions reached here, 33 species, including 31 varieties, are recognised and over one hundred previously established names are placed in synonymy.Four new taxa are described: B. pilosiuscula var. suffruticosa, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. minuticymosa, B. virgata subsp. virgata var. velutina and B. virgata subsp. virgata var. maxima. The following new combinations are made: B. densiflora var. boninensis, B. heterophylla var. blumei, B. japonica var. silvestrii, B. japonica var. tenera, B. sieboldiana var. fuzhouensis, B. ternifolia var. kamley, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. canescens, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. densiglomerata, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. longissima, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. macrostachya, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. molliuscula, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. rotundifolia, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. scabrella, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. strigosa, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. sumatrana, B. virgata subsp. macrophylla var. tomentosa and B. virgata subsp. virgata var. austroqueenslandica.

N2  - Annesijoa is an endemic monotypic genus from New Guinea with as single species A. novoguineensis. Elateriospermum is also monotypic (E. tapos) and found in West Malesia. The South American genus Hevea comprises about 10 species. One species (H. brasiliensis) is presently cultivated worldwide in plantations for its rubber and has become one of the major economic products of SE Asia. Two other species, H. guianensis and H. pauciflora are sometimes present in Malesian botanical gardens.

The papillose, multicellular floral trichomes, the tepal’s erose margins, the small, zygomorphic perianth mouth and the dull purplish brown coloration give A. foertheriana a distinctive appearance within the genus. The species is here assessed as being critically endangered.

N2  - Chromosome numbers and other karyological data of four Stemona spp. (Stemonaceae) from Thailand are reported. Three taxa (S. collinsae Craib, S. kerrii Craib and an unidentified species) exhibit 2n = 14 chromosomes, for S. curtisii Hook.f. a range of 2n = 13–16 was established. Based on the counts of c. 30% of the species of Stemona, x = 7 is very likely to be the basic number for the genus. Chromosome size and morphology of the investigated species are compared with literature data and show differences that might be of importance for infrageneric classification. In this connection the taxonomic position of the genus Pentastemona from Sumatra is also discussed.

N2  - A taxonomic account is given of six Piper species of New Guinea: P. bolanicum spec. nov., P. gibbil­imbum, P. recessum spec. nov., P. subbullatum, P. triangulare and P. wabagense. These small shrubby trees are best represented in secondary growth and forest at 1300–2500 m altitude, with P. gibbilimbum reaching c. 3000 m and P. bolanicum (and rarely P. triangulare) c. 3500 m. Piper sub­bullatum, the most widespread of the six in New Guinea, sometimes descends to sea-level there and is also found in the Philippines and from the Bismarck Archipelago to Vanuatu. The New World species P. aduncum and P. subpeltatum, adventive to New Guinea, are treated briefly. Piper recessum spec. nov. has been confused with P. gibbilimbum and P. subbullatum but is a completely glabrous plant. Its inflorescences have fleshy, asymmetrically peltate, strongly overlapping bracts. At anthesis the bracts move apart slightly; in the male the anthers dehisce underneath the bract-heads, while in the female the stigmas become (only just) visible between the sides of the bract-heads. One or more species of thrips may be this plant’s pollinators.

N2  - Despite the various taxonomic revisions of Abrus Adans., species and infraspeciﬁc delimitation are not always clear. In those revisions very little reference is made to micromorphological characters, in particular to those of the compound leaves, in spite of the stability of some of those characters. By using techniques of light and scanning microscopy this study reveals some interesting results concerning to leaflet surface, such as some of the characters of the epidermis cells, stomata, presence of papillae and trichomes. These characters show some range of variation at the species level but not at the subspecies level. We conclude that those structures can provide additional characters useful in Abrus for species and infraspeciﬁc segregation. This study also supports Breteler’s delimitation of the African Abrus species.

N2  - A taxonomic revision is made of the Neotropical genus Pseudoxandra. This genus forms part of the Cremastosperma alliance which consists of Bocageopsis, Cremastosperma, Ephedranthus, Klarobelia, Malmea, Mosannona, Onychopetalum, Oxandra, Pseudephedranthus, Pseudomalmea, Pseudoxandra, Ruizodendron, and Unonopsis, all from the Neotropics. Within Pseudoxandra 22 species are recognized, four of which were described quite recently by the first author (Maas et al., 1986). Fourteen species are described here as new. Two dichotomous keys are provided, one for the genera of the Cremastosperma alliance, and the other for the species of Pseudoxandra. The species treatments include descriptions, geographical and ecological notes, distribution maps, synonymy, taxonomic notes, and vernacular names. A complete index of exsiccatae is included. Parallel to the taxonomic revision, a leaf anatomical survey was made by E.-J. van Marle. One of the intriguing features in Pseudoxandra is the frequent presence of minuscule warts on the leaves in dried specimens, while fresh material does not show any such warts. Osteosclereids found in the mesophyll of most species are probably responsible for this feature. This revision is meant as a precursor for a future Flora Neotropica treatment of the integral Cremastosperma alliance. Revisions of Klarobelia, Malmea s.s., Mosannona and Pseudomalmea, once constituting the genus Malmea s.l., were published earlier by Chatrou (1998). Treatments of other genera are under way, or planned for the near future.

N2  - Changes in generic concepts and delimitation resulted in 80 genera (6 of which are cultivated) of Philippine Rubiaceae. Generic descriptions of all genera are coded in DELTA format (Version 2000) and translated by the directive CONFOR into INTKEY database for interactive identification and information retrieval. The descriptions incorporate mostly compiled data of Philippine Rubiaceae species and observations on over 130 characters. Recently accepted classification (subfamily, tribes, and subtribes) and significant characters defined by Robbrecht (1988, 1993) are appended to the generic descriptions. The database is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/ departments/planta2/wgl/delta_ru/index.html.

N2  - Pollen of 57 species of Syzygium from SE Asia were surveyed by SEM. The grains are all ± triangular in polar view, uniformly small (mean diameter 10.4 μm) with few surface sculpturing features. All species examined exhibit a distinct apocolpium and, usually, apocolpial field. The presence of an apocolpial field cannot be linked to any known taxonomic grouping within the genus. It does not appear possible to distinguish the species of Syzygium on the basis of features of the pollen visible under SEM, though section Jambosa tends to have larger pollen with a proportionally larger apocolpium than species not in that section. Estimates for the number of pollen grains per stamen in species with larger pollen grains (± section Jambosa) are 5× as great as for other species in the genus. TEM preparations showed the pollen surface to bear small supratectal processes and to be covered with pollenkit. The foot layer is well developed and more or less of the same thickness as the tectum. The columellae are of variable width and the endexine c. 0.05 μm thick. Various features of flower size are found to be positively correlated to pollen size. As large pollen grains are linked to large staminal numbers and large stamens (long filaments and large anthers) it is suggested that investigation of the breeding biology of section Jambosa is required.

N2  - Fourteen species of Sauropus are recognised for Malesia, 21 for Thailand. Two species are described as new, S. asymmetricus of Sumatra and S. shawii of Borneo. Many new synonyms, especially for S. androgynus and S. rhamnoides, are provided. The latter two species have a much wider distribution than described before and both are difficult to separate from each other. A phylogeny based on morphological and palynological data proved futile, but showed that Sauropus together with Breynia and Glochidion are embedded in the paraphyletic Phyllanthus. Most species which formerly belonged to Synostemon and are now included in Sauropus are probably, with the exception of S. bacciformis, related to Breynia and Glochidion. Because of the poor phylogenetic results the circumscription of Sauropus is not changed (Synostemon still included), and an infrageneric classification is not provided.

Distribution maps are provided and conservation status is assessed for the new species. Thottea dependens and T. tricornis are redefined and T. parviflora is lectotypified. Thottea is now represented by 16 species in Peninsular Malaysia and two in Singapore. A spherical-ovoid shaped perianth with an aperture at the top is observed for the first time in Thottea.The white and bicoloured perianth are described for the first time in Peninsular Malaysian Thottea. Eight out of the nine novelties fall in the IUCN ‘Threatened’ category, and six of them are considered as ‘Critically Endangered’.

N2  - In order to evaluate pollen morphological descriptions of Alchornea in the literature, which are almost completely based on African and American species, the pollen of eight Southeast Asian species of Alchornea was investigated, using light and scanning electron microscopy. Very little variation appeared to be present in the Asian material. Slightly deviating from the scabrate ornamentation type are A. kelungensis (psilate) and A. rugosa (striate-rugulate). The scabrate type is also found in A. castaneaefolia (Brazil), A. hirtella (Liberia) and A. obovata (Colombia). The operculate Alchornea pollen type, which can be easily recognised using light microscopy, seems to represent a diagnostic character for the tribe Alchornieae (pollen of Bossera unknown). Its characteristic appearance resulted in a relatively extensive fossil record. The earliest records are from the Middle Eocene of Venezuela and Nigeria, while records for Australia and Borneo date from the mid-Tertiary and the Neogene (Miocene–Pliocene), respectively. These records suggest that the tribe Alchornieae has an African– American Gondwanic origin, and reached its pantropic distribution at least in the mid-Tertiary.

N2  - The Sapotaceae are a medium-sized family with, in the tropics, a world-wide distribution. Because of the variability of several characters its taxonomy at genus and species level is rather complicated and hence its nomenclature sometimes confusing. Producing a checklist for such a family is a brave, major undertaking. The principal authors, Govaerts and Frodin, were assisted in the first place by Pennington (system, genera, Neotropics) and furthermore by W. Vink (Leiden, for Malesia) and L. W. Jessup (Indooroopilly, for Australia).As the title indicates the main body of the book (p. 25-337) is a checklist of names. Accepted names are given with author citation, publication place, distribution and synonyms. Genera are provided with some notes. With synonyms only author citation is given together with reference to the accepted name of which it is synonymous. The checklist is preceded by some general chapters and a selected bibliography. It is followed by lists of dubious and excluded taxa. Throughout the book several (unnumbered) pen and ink drawings are inserted.

N2  - This volume on medicinal and poisonous plants treats lesser known species. In the brief introduction to the book it is explained that the choice of taxa to be included is a bit arbitrary and mostly based on the amount of information available. For the species treated in vol. 12(1) more information is available than for those treated in vol. 12 (2). However, the book discusses many taxa with surprisingly detailed information, maybe the truly lesser known species are saved for vol. 12 (3). Many of the taxa treated are not originally found in South-East Asia, but are locally or widely cultivated in the area. For general information on medicinal and poisonous plants the reader is referred to vol. 12 (1).As usual for the PROSEA volumes, also this one is produced along the well-known PROSEA standards.

N2  - Micrococca is a rare genus represented in the Malesian region by only three species. Micrococca mercurialis (L.) Benth. is widespread, but in Malesia it is found only in Peninsular Malaysia. Micrococca malaccensis Airy Shaw and M. johorica Airy Shaw are both endemic to Johore. Micrococca can be distinguished from its close allies, Erythrococca and Claoxylon, by its interrupted racemes (with long internodes), pistillate flowers with elongated (strap-like) disc lobes, and a deeply 3-lobed, thinly crustaceous capsule dehiscing both septicidally and loculicidally. Micrococca mercurialis is a small-leaved shrub, while the other two species are trees with much larger leaves. Micrococca johorica has glands on the leaf bases, narrow leaves, and short inflorescences, whereas M. malaccensis lacks glands on the leaf bases, has wider leaves, and longer inflorescences.

The present double volume is the outcome of many years of work resulting in this impressive book on the Australian Wattles.In the introduction brief discussions on Classification and Phylogeny, Phytogeography, Fossil record, and Uses are presented. From the paragraphs on classification and phylogeny it is clear that a lot more work has to be done to solve remaining problems of relationship between species, groups and subgroups. The key, to all species!, covers no less than 152 pages. All species are illustrated with black and white drawings of important details, 128 with colour photographs as well. Maps to all species are included. The descriptions are in the usual format of the Flora of Australia.

N2  - The sections Azorelloida, Neoandina, and Paramensia of Geranium, all of them from the Andes, are taxonomically revised. Fruits with the ‘seed ejection-type’ dispersal have been found in all species, which allows classifying them within subg. Geranium. The sections Azorelloida and Paramensia consist of one and two species respectively, while section Neoandina comprises 24 taxa. Prior to this revision, the stemless species of Geranium from the Andes have been considered to belong to sect. Andina. Geranium sessiliflorum (type of Geranium sect. Andina), however, should be included in sect. Chilensia. Therefore, recently a new sect. Neoandina has been described to include most of the sect. Andina species (Aedo, 2000). Diagnostic morphological features are analysed and compared within and between the sections. The parsimony analysis suggested an early separation of sect. Paramensia from the rest of the ingroup constituted by the sections Azorelloida and Neoandina. These sections would later on have become separated into two groups: one with paramo species, and the other with more xerophilous, cold-resistant puna species. The biogeographic analyses using Fitch parsimony, dispersal-vicariance optimisation, and Bremer analysis support a paramo origin for the entire group in the North Andes, followed by a colonisation of southernmost regions (puna) and vicariance. A key, species descriptions, a complete list of synonymy, a list of specimens examined, and distribution maps are provided. Most species are illustrated for the first time. Fifteen lectotypes and one neotype are designated.

N2  - This book is the complement of the also recently published practitioner’s manual ‘Techniques in Molecular Systematics and Evolution’ (see Book Notices, p. 346) and focuses on present progress in molecular systematics. It is divided into three major parts. The first section examines the utility of molecular information in systematics through empirical examples ranging from population, species and genus to order level. The reader is subsequently exposed to problems relevant to the understanding of hierarchical relationships around geographical races and species boundaries and shortcomings of analytical methods applied at the level of bird, mammal and insect orders such as limited taxon sampling and rapid radiations. The second section looks at problems occurring when using molecular data. First, current pitfalls associated with multiple sequence alignments are discussed, such as the high degree of subjectivity of manual alignments. Then the process of tree construction is explained by chapters on parallel computing, statistical aspects of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and distance methods. Finally, the role of molecular characters in constructing trees at and around the species level is examined, also in combination with classical morphological and new developmental data to make statements about the origin of evolutionary novelties. The final section is dedicated to recently developed computer-based tools to examine gene family evolution, and includes explanations on how products of various large genome databases can be correlated to evolutionary processes such as functional change. Empirical examples include the evolutionary history of repeated motifs in spider silks that are correlated with their mechanical attributes and horizontal transfer in microbial evolution.The editors themselves already acknowledge the decidedly cladistic approach and the fact that a large number of authors are associated with the American Museum of Natural History. The editors also state that the book is primarily written to serve as a broad and updated information source regarding new approaches in systematics. Most of the chapters are indeed clearly written, easy to read and nicely illustrated. However, to completely meet with this goal, some empirical examples of studies on fungi, algae and plants and increasingly used modern techniques such as supertrees, parametric bootstrapping, Bayesian analyses and molecular dating should have been included, too.

N2  - The application of modern techniques in histochemistry, electron microscopy, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc. in the last decades has changed embryology from a descriptive science to an experimental and applied science. The present book is a result of this development.A score of authors deals with all aspects of embryology from male and female gametogenesis to fruits and seeds. Amongst the topics discussed in this volume are: male and female sporogenesis, fertilisation (in vivo and in vitro), zygotic and somatic embryogenesis, endosperm development, maturation, germination and dormancy of seeds. Some of the more special subjects are apomixis and parthenocarpy.

N2  - Magnolia section Maingola Dandy is distinguished from other members of Magnoliaceae by the combination of a terminal brachyblast, cylindrical fruits, and free stipules. Morphological characters were re-examined for section Maingola and section Alcimandra, which has been considered to be closely related to the former. Although section Alcimandra is separated from section Maingola in having long stamens which hide the gynoecium, it is combined with section Maingola because this feature is frequently found in various other taxa of the family. Moreover, recent molecular phylogenetic studies have also demonstrated the close affinity between sections Maingola and Alcimandra. For the Magnolia macklottii complex, which has been problematic due to the wide range of variation in taxonomically important characters, a principal component analysis was carried out for 28 characters. Two varieties, M. macklottii var. macklottii and var. beccariana, are recognised in the complex. They are distinguished from each other mainly by hairs on fruit and peduncle (glabrous (to glabrescent)/densely hairy). Hairs on the twig, the length of scars of perianth and stamens, and leaf shape, which were previously regarded as important characters, could not separate the two varieties. In this study, seven species with five varieties are recognised in section Maingola.

N2  - This is a well-illustrated text book for students of the Open University, comprising six chapters: 1. Plant evolution and structure; 2. Photosynthesis; 3. Water and transport in plants; 4. Plant mineral nutrition; 5. Plant growth and development; 6. Interactions between seed plants and microbes. I cannot really judge the quality of the latter five chapters, although the last chapter (6) and especially the treatment of the plant-fungus relation seem quite fine to me. I feel more capable of evaluating the first chapter (1) on evolution and structure. And, I must say that I am a bit critical on this one. It is always difficult to find an optimum between completeness on the one hand and a good focus on brief treatments of essential items on the other. However, in this case I see too many omissions. No treatment of evolution can be given without presenting a skeleton phylogeny with presumed apomorphies indicated. A phylogenetic tree as presented in fig. 1.3 does not give clues, not to mention possible criticism on e.g. the implied monophyly of the hepatics, hornworts and bryophytes. The book not only focuses on plants (embryophytes), it is restricted to it. Not dealing with its sistergroup and further outgroups, in my view, severely hampers a proper understanding of the phylogeny and evolution of plants. A last omission to be mentioned is that none of the gymnosperm groups have been treated, which again hampers proper understanding of seeds and seed plants and places the discussion on the success of flowering plants in a kind of vacuum. There are enough examples of recent text books on plants, botany or biology showing that with only a few pages more, a much better view on the evolution of plant diversity can be presented. This, in my view, will be of great benefit for especially those students who are mainly interested in the last five, more physiologically oriented chapters.

The taxa included representatives of the tribes Arabideae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, Lunarieae, Matthioleae, and Sisymbrieae, which all occur in Egypt. Macro- and micromorphological characters, including seed shape, colour, size, the position of the radicle relative to the cotyledons, epidermal cell shape, anticlinal boundaries, outer periclinal cell wall and relief of outer cell walls, are presented. Three types of basic anticlinal cell wall boundaries are recognised and six different shapes of the outer periclinal cell wall are described. A key for the identification of the investigated taxa based on seed characters is provided.

N2  - Section Moniliformes Carr of the orchid genus Coelogyne is revised using morphological and molecular data. Twelve species are recognised, including two new ones (C. chanii and C. renae). and a dubious one (C. crassiloba). A combined analysis of morphological characters, and sequences of the nrDNA ITS region, matK gene, trnT-trnL intergenic spacer, trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer supports the monophyly of the section as here recognised. Persistence of the rhizome scales, shape of the margin of the leaves, inflorescence type, shape of the rachis, its nodes and pedicel scars, indument of the floral bracts, lip size and depth of the sinus of the lateral lobes of the hypochile seem to be phylogenetically informative characters. Shape of the leaf blade, flowering mode, shape of the base and keels of the hypochile, shape of the apex of the lateral lobes and keels of the epichile and shape of the column show many parallelisms.

A comprehensive synopsis of the genus is provided in the general part, where morphological characters and their variations are discussed. This paper will focus in particular on the species occurring in Burma, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia (West Malaysia), and Sumatra. Here, the genus includes 10 species, most of which are endemic to Peninsular Malaysia, with only two species endemic to Thailand (P. siamensis and P. tuberosa), and two other also occurring outside the Malaysian political boundaries (P. rotundifolia and P. hispida). Part II of this paper will treat the species of Borneo and Natuna Island.

N2  - This practitioner’s manual is the complement to the recently published volume ‘Molecular Systematics and Evolution: Theory and Practice’ and focuses on recently developed techniques for data acquisition and analysis in molecular systematics and evolutionary biology. The first section examines analytical methods in chapters dealing with DNA sequence alignment optimisations, techniques for analysing large data sets as implemented in the program TNT, measures of support and data partitions. Approaches that will develop further in the next few years are also covered and the reader is subsequently exposed to chapters on genome databases and comparative phylogenomics.The second section is dedicated to obtaining and archiving specimens for molecular work and laboratory methods. Future developments are again included by chapters on high-throughput DNA sequencing and in situ hybridisation techniques. Due to the detailed protocols on DNA isolations of plants, algae, animals and bacteria from both fresh, silica-dried and ancient museum material, various PCR methods, microsatellite analysis and information on web-located sites, both systematists and evolutionary biologists can find a lot of information in this manual about modern molecular data collection techniques. In addition, molecular biologists might get ideas on how their data can be analysed in an evolutionary context.

N2  - The genus Ptilothamnion Thur. in Le Jolis is represented in South Africa by three, or possibly four species: P. codicolum, P. polysporum, P. goukammae spec. nov., and reportedly P. subsimplex, all recorded after 1983. An earlier record of P. pluma is probably erroneous.The new species differs from known representatives of the genus by producing strictly one involucral filament from the hypogenous cell and additionally one from the subhypogenous cell. Ptilothamnion is a widespread genus, but rarely with more than two species in any given regional flora. A critical comparison of the c. 12 species shows that very few characters are shared by all of them.

N2  - The increased interest in biodiversity assessment studies by plant taxonomists calls for thorough knowledge of ecological theory and experimental design. Many very good textbooks have been published on plant population ecology and my first impression was therefore, is there a need for yet another textbook? After careful reading my answer is ‘yes’. The book is clearly setup with the idea ‘how to set up your experiment’, but it is certainly not a cooking book. After the introduction of theories and case studies from plant ecology the book focusses on the planning of a study. Many examples from the literature are used to provide the reader with more insight in ecological research. This part ends with the statistical design of experiments, written by Elizabeth John. Again many different tests are introduced, but John acknowledges the use of door stopping statistical textbooks when further planning your experiment. Both ANOVA and multivariate techniques are introduced and discussed, but as with many ecological textbooks the latter group of statistical tests is far from complete. This is a pity for biodiversity studies that so heavily rely on such tests. The third part describes the actual implementation of the study and how to measure biotic and abiotic treatments and conditions. The book ends with modelling and spatial analysis. Here Gibson is incomplete, since the part on analysis of transition matrices is clearly outdated and replaced by loop analysis. The fact that Gibson completely ignores this analysis, which was already published in the mid-90s, is a small stain on this comprehensive textbook. ‘Methods in Comparative Plant Population Ecology’ can become a standard book for undergraduate students in ecology doing their first experimental research. The book can assist senior scientists already working in the field as a mnemonic, and it will be of great value to teachers who are developing modules in population ecology. After reading the book, hopefully you will never pseudo-replicate your experiment!

The diagnostic characters for the sections are discussed briefly in the section headings. Mallotus section Hancea is defined more precisely than before, resulting in the exclusion of 4 species from this section (M. brachythyrsus, M. havilandii, M. insularum (new rank) and M. miquelianus). Mallotus beccarii is synonymised with M. brachythyrsus, and M. tenuipes with M. penangensis. This section contains 12 species. In Mallotus section Stylanthus, M. oblongifolius is synonymised with M. peltatus. This section contains 6 species.

N2  - The genera Agrostistachys and Chondrostylis, subtribe Agrostistachydeae, have been revised. Chondrostylis comprises two species, C. bankana appears to be much more widespread than was assumed. Agrostistachys comprises six species, one of which is new ( (A. staminodiatus), while several species (e.g. A. intramarginalis and A. meeboldii) have been reduced to the now quite variable A. borneensis, formerly mainly known as. A. longifolia. A phylogenetic analysis of the subtribe Agrostistachydeae shows that all four genera (also Cyttaranthus and I Pseudagrostistachys) are monophyletic; however, the position of Agrostistachys is very weak and the genus may easily change to a paraphyletic group with the other genera nested in it. Even in spite of the weak support for Agrostistachys all genera are maintained in their present circumscription.

Flora treatments and local revisions for this genus of about 100 species have been produced for Peninsular Malaysia (Kochummen, 1989) and Australia (Hyland, 1989) with ten and thirty-eight species, respectively. A revision of Endiandra in Borneo contributes to the taxonomic understanding of the genus. Eight species, with a possible ninth imperfectly known species, are recognized on the island. Three species, E. immersa, E. elongata, and E. rhizophoretum, are described as new; the five other species are E. clavigera Kosterm., E. ochracea Kosterm., E. kingiana Gamble, E. macrophylla (Blume) Boerl., and E. rubescens (Blume) Miq.; E. rigidior Kosterm. is an imperfectly known species. A key to the eight species, and descriptions, illustrations, discussions, and distribution maps of each species are provided.

N2  - Lauraceae are an important component of wet tropical forests and are well represented in the Flora Malesiana region. Their identification has been hampered by two factors: several of the genera are poorly defined and existing keys require both flowers and fruits, which are, however, rarely present together on a specimen. Here a key based almost entirely on flowering specimens is presented, problems in generic delimitation are discussed and vegetative characters helpful in generic identification are listed.

N2  - The genus Mezzettiopsis Ridl. (Annonaceae) is revised and transferred to Orophea Blume subgenus Sphaerocarpon Keßler. Phylogenetic analysis of subgenus Sphaerocarpon and Mezzettiopsis places Mezzettiopsis within the subgenus. Furthermore, the prevalence of common or overlapping character states and the paucity of unique character states necessitate the transfer. Two species were transferred from Mezzettiopsis. Of these, one species of Orophea is reinstated and one new combination is made. Three species are described as new. In total, nine species are fully described. Sphaerocarpon is a subgenus of small, tropical, lowland trees distributed from Sulawesi westwards to South India. It is characterised by having sepals and outer petals that are sessile or nearly sessile and more or less ovate, with outer petals that are twice the size of the sepals, inner petals that are clawed, roughly diamond-shaped and connivent during development at the edges of the lamina, by miliusoid stamens, by stipitate, globose to oblongate carpidia, and by glabrous to pubescent leaves. A key to the flowering material is presented.

Since Soegeng's work no attempt at a revision has been made and no new species have been described.Coelostegia and Durio are very difficult to distinguish by vegetative characters only. Flower and fruit characters are very important for species recognition. During field work in the Kayan Mentarang National Park, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, the author collected specimens of a Coelostegia-like plant that proved to be a new species.

N2  - The commodity group Exudates (defined as the fluids that ooze out of a wound of a tree) is divided into three groups of substances: Resins, Latex, and Gums. Resins, usually mixes of terpenes, are primarily used in paints and varnishes. Latex, of which the most important is rubber, is used in car tyres, engineering components and consumers goods, including chewing gum. The main components of latex are polyisoprenes and resins. Vegetable gums consist of mixtures of polysaccharides and are often used in cosmetics, soaps, and in food products as stabiliser or emulsifier. For the field botanist exudate is a useful character. However, this use is not mentioned in the PROSEA volume.The introduction, where the properties of the exudates are discussed, is followed by the treatment of genera and species. Major exudate-producing species are treated in full (Chapter 2), minor species only briefly (Chapter 3), while Chapter 4 lists species with other primary uses. References, a glossary, and an index complete the volume.

N2  - This fine book consists of two parts: a general account (pp. 1-64) and a taxonomic account (pp. 65-451). The taxonomic account consists of detailed descriptions of all 466 species in 52 orchid genera that are known to occur in Southern Africa, i.e. the area covering the territories of South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Botswana. A surprisingly high percentage of the species is illustrated with colour photographs of excellent quality. Distribution maps are provided for almost all taxa, while for each taxon a number of selected vouchers are given. This part of the book leaves little to be desired: keys to the species, references, synonymy, illustrations, cladograms, almost all one could wish to find in such a book is there, and this solid comprehensiveness makes Orchids of Southern Africa by far the best source ever produced on orchids from this region.Unlike European botanists working on tropical orchids, the authors of this book live in the area where their subjects occur, which is obviously a great advantage. It is for this reason that I feel justified in slightly qualifying my otherwise uniform praise. I am a little disappointed to find the notes on the ecology of the species in many cases quite superficial. The photographs often show the species growing in their habitats, and it is readily apparent that they usually occupy highly specific niches. Yet, not infrequently all that we learn of the ecology of a particular species is that it grows in damp grassland. Surely much more is known to the authors and their collaborators than what we find here.

N2  - Eleven October 2001 is the 80th birthday of Dr. Ding Hou, much appreciated Honorary Staff Member of our Nationaal Herbarium Nederland. Time to reflect on the life and career of this modest but highly productive and talented botanist.Ding Hou was born in 1921 in Hsingkan, Kiangsi Province, China. From 1941— 1945 he studied Botany for his BSc degree at the National Chung-Cheng University in Kiangsi, where he spent another two years as Botanical Assistant. From 1947- 1951 he held a similar position at the National Taiwan University in Taipei. He then moved to the United States of America where he earned an MA in Plant Taxonomy at the Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in 1952, and his PhD on a revision of the genus Celastrus in 1955 under supervision of Robert E. Woodson, Jr. He also held research assistantships in St. Louis, from 1951-1952 in the Missouri Botanical Garden, and from 1954-1955 in the MO Herbarium. In 1955 he was appointed as Botanist at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, but in 1956 he was lured away to Leiden by C.G.G.J, van Steenis who attached him to his then externally funded Flora Malesiana Team. In 1960 his appointment as Senior Scientific Officer at the Rijksherbarium secured him tenure until his retirement in 1986. However, that retirement date did not change Ding's daily pattern of work in the herbarium which will hopefully continue until long after his 80th birthday.

N2  - After several volumes of the Plant Systematics and Evolution Supplementum Series dealing with pollen and pollination (Suppl. 5: Morphology, development and systematic relevance of pollen and spores; Suppl. 6: Secondary pollen presentation; Suppl. 7: The tapetum), this special edition of Plant Systematics and Evolution 222 (1-4) is a welcome addition, including many aspects not treated before. The title of the book covers its theme very well. All 16 contributions consider connections between pollen characters (amount, morphology, development, cytochemistry, odour, colour, electrostatics, viability, digestibility, etc.) and pollination features (e.g. abiotic pollination, collection of pollen by bees, bat pollination, beetle pollination), most of them reviewing the literature of the last decades. All are well-written and very worth reading, but I especially want to mention those on cytochemistry (listing easy technics grouped to specificity), pollen viability and longevity (reviewing tests), ecology and evolution of pollen odours, ecology and evolution of visual pollen signals, nutritional content and digestibility, pollen morphological evolution in bat-pollinated plants, structure and function of orchid pollinaria, thread-like structures associated with pollen and anthers, and the evolution of the beetle pollination syndrome.As a systematic herbarium pollen morphologist I often have to select and recommend pollen text books to students explaining the wide palynological variation in seed plants. The present book seems to me compulsory additional reading in order to avoid a strongly biased knowledge of pollen based on dead exine structures alone. Moreover, this is a well-produced book, provided with an extensive index. The “67 partly coloured figures” announced on the title page are actually c. 140 figures (often more than 1 photo per plate) of which 24 are in full-colour.

N2  - In a taxonomic revision of the genus Blechnum of the Malesian region 20 taxa (17 species and 3 subspecies) are recognised. Much of the past confusion over names, especially of the Papua New Guinea taxa, has been the result of some species being based on inadequate, often single, collections. One new species and one new subspecies are described and two new combinations are made. Fortythree species and seven varieties are put into synonymy. A key, full descriptions, distribution maps and illustrations of the less well understood taxa, as well as scanning electron microscope images of the spores, are presented. Where a taxon also occurs outside the Malesian region, full distributional details are provided, so far as can at present be verified by field observations and herbarium collections. The distribution patterns of a number of the taxa appear to be closely related to their limited ecological tolerances. The biogeography of the genus in the Malesian region is discussed.

N2  - The monophyletic genus Melastoma (Melastomataceae) is centred in Southeast Asia, but extends to India, South China, Japan, northern Australia, and Oceania. It comprises 22 species, two subspecies, and three varieties. Two new species, Melastoma sabahense and M. minahassae, and a new variety, M. sanguineum var. ranauensis, are described; two species are reduced to subspecies and variety, respectively, and the genus Otanthera is transferred to Melastoma. In many species, especially M. malabathricum, morphological characters vary locally, which resulted in the taxonomic recognition of numerous geographically restricted entities here considered synonyms. Most species of Melastoma are pioneers with a high dispersal capacity. This may have resulted in small, relatively isolated populations in which unique character combinations were stabilised locally.

N2  - Two populations from Mount Kinabalu, Borneo, are recognised as two new subspecies of Lasianthus inodorus Blume (Rubiaceae), which occurs in montane habitats in mainland Southeast Asia, Sumatra and Java. The species and its subspecies are considered to compose a particular taxonomic group in the genus. Ecology and biogeography of the species group are discussed with the historical explanation of the tectonic history of Cenozoic Southeast Asia. The example strongly supports the concept of floristic connections between Malesia and mainland Southeast Asia.

N2  - As stated in the preface, this book is intended as a textbook on orchid biology. Fifteen chapters treat a diverse array of topics, from physiology to ethnobotany.In spite of its title, Fundamentals of Orchid Biology contains much general information that is only indirectly related to the purported subject matter. The chapter on cytology, for example, contains little which cannot be found in any undergraduate textbook on cell biology. More than one page in this chapter is devoted to the microscope used by Robert Brown, about which we learn that “it was made by the English barometers manufacturer Robert Banks (who also spelled his name Bancks) before 1820, and its stage is engraved with the maker’s name and address –Banks 441 Strand London.” I quote this as a specimen of the irrelevant information (others might like to call it erudition) which is found on almost every page, perhaps the most irrelevant item being a photograph of the last wife of Mao Zedong on page 50.

N2  - The taxonomy and ecology of the genus Hoya R.Br, are unclear, especially in the core area of its distribution: Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. This paper summarises the available information on the ecology of Hoya species, and describes eight species from central Sulawesi. An important ecological trait of many Hoya species is their association with ants. Four types of mutualistic relationships with ants occur in the genus: 1) species with specialised leaves to house ants; 2) a single species that provides housing for ants under imbricate leaves; 3) species growing on the carton of ant nests; and 4) species that root in ant inhabited cavities in tree trunks and branches. Four of the eight described species grew in association with ants (types 2-4). Taxonomically, Hoya sussuela (Roxb.) Merr. is placed in synonymy with H. coronaria Blume, and H. maxima (H. Karst.) Warb. and H. pseudomaxima Koord. are reduced to H. imbricata Decne. Three new species are described.

N2  - Over 40 years ago Robert Hegnauer started a comprehensive review of the comparative phytochemistry of fungi and plants. With the publication of the volume on the Papilionoideae (Fabaceae) the series is now complete.Over the years the authors shifted their emphasis: In the earlier volumes family treatments give a highly summarised account of the most important chemical compounds and their taxonomic significance. While in the Leguminosae volumes detailed attention is given to ethnobotany and associated phytochemical traits that may explain the uses, much less attention is paid to the possible systematic and phylogenetic significance. However, these volumes contain a wealth of information that is otherwise scattered throughout a large body of literature.

N2  - The leaf anatomical diversity of the genera Baccaurea Lour. (43 species), Distichirhops Haegens (3 species) and Nothobaccaurea Haegens (2 species) (Euphorbiaceae) is described. Two species of Aporosa and three species of Maesobotrya were examined for comparison. The following characters are important for the delimitation of species: hair types, the position of the glandular areas on the leaf margin, the hairiness and size of the glandular areas, the number of epidermal layers, the presence of (mucilage) idioblasts in the epidermis, the presence of palisade parenchyma above the vascular bundles, and the birefringence of the spongy parenchyma cell walls. However, leaf anatomy did not yield characters for distinction between the five genera studied. Phenetic analysis resulted in a grouping based on leaf anatomical similarities that corresponds to a large extent with the phylogenetic position of species based on a cladistic analysis of largely macromorphological features (Haegens, 2000).

N2  - As a companion to an exhibition in the Austrian National Library Dr. Walter Lack compiled a catalogue describing in detail the exhibited books and manuscripts, discussing also the major illustrators. Garden Eden, aptly subtitled ‘Masterpieces of Botanical Illustration’, is a beautifully illustrated and carefully edited book. It contains a wealth of information on botanical books and illustrators. The subjects are chronologically ordered, running from about 512, Code Aniciae Julianae, to 2000, Ein Garten für die Ewigkeit.The works chosen for the exhibition and for the book Garden Eden give ample opportunity to demonstrate different styles and techniques of illustration and different printing techniques. Included are examples of black and white drawings, watercolour, oil painting and nature printing, and examples of illustrations of whole plants down to very detailed drawings of flowers and fruits, sometimes including anatomical details. In this way the book gives also an overview of the development of illustration and printing from handwritten manuscripts to off-set printed books. The texts, which by the way are offered in English, French and German, are concise but give enough information about authors and illustrators. A bibliography and several indices complete the book

We describe C. parva, a new species from Borneo, and separate C. integrifolia, distributed in Japan and Taiwan and probably in China too, from Southeast Asian C. bicuspis. The three species differ from each other in the size, shape and texture of lamina, divergence angles between lobes, frequency of bilobed leaves, and spore size and morphology. Cheiropleuria parva is distinct from C. bicuspis populations sympatric on Mt Kinabalu in the leaves of juvenile and adult plants, suggesting reproductive isolation. Nucleotide differences in the rbcL gene support separation of the three species.

(Melastomataceae) peculiar for possessing a feature nearly unique for the family: leaf blades with a pair of lateral lobes at the base (‘pseudo-stipules’). This character was previously recorded for Astronidium miraculum-dei J.F. Maxwell  Veldk. (Astronioideae) from the nearby Solomon Islands. Various explanations, none satisfactory, for this phenomenon are explored. The group consists of 15 taxa, 2 previously described, 13 proposed here. The correct authorship of Medinilla is ‘Gaudich. ex DC.’, the correct name for the type species is Medinilla medinilliana (Gaudich.) Fosberg  Sachet, and not M. rosea Gaudich. ex DC., nom. superfl. Medinilla rubicunda (Jack) Blume var. hasseltii (Blume) Bakh.f. is validated. The descriptions of M. arfakensis Baker f. and M. brassii Markgr. are emended. A study of the palynology confirmed the homogeneity within Medinilla and among related genera.

N2  - A revision of the genus Phaeanthus Hook.f.  Thomson (Annonaceae) is presented. The genus comprises 8 species. A key to the fruiting and/or flowering specimens of the genus is included. The genus consists of shrubs to small-sized trees from Malesia and Vietnam. It is characterised by sepals and outer petals that are alike, numerous carpels and stamens, the latter truncate with a distinctive connective prolongation, monocarpous fruits, and leaves often drying dark brown to black. A phylogenetic analysis shows the monophyly of the genus and that Phaeanthus nutans can be considered the sister species of the remaining species.

N2  - This is a CD-ROM intended to identify 1733 species of trees and shrubs of northern Australian rain forests, accompanied by a user guide in book form. In the guide, in the chapter ‘Using the program’, a picture of the opening screen is given. At the bot-tom is the status bar, which, however, only appears on the screen if the windows (NT) status bar is hidden! In the user guide it is explained how to hide the windows status bar. In the status bar the remaining number of species is indicated, which is of importance because it is of no use to see the species list if there are more than 15 species left.The following character sets are available: habit, bark (not in shrubs), leaf, flower, fruit, seedling, family, geographic area. For each character or character state an explanation is provided, often illustrated, in the help function. Often it is obligatory to use this help for a good interpretation of a character, for instance lateral veins run from the midrib to the intramarginal vein. To be qualified as an intramarginal vein rather than looping lateral veins there should be no major bends (illustrated). Here I went wrong in identifying Symplocos, where a looped intramarginal vein usually is present! Also, don't call a contracted spike a fascicle (clearly illustrated), for you will never arrive at the right name. The features selected for any character set will remain until a new identification is started, even if the window is closed.

All native and naturalised Singapore seed plants are covered by these two volumes, as well as some of the commonly cultivated ones. This volume covers 34 families with approximately 750 species.Keys to the families and genera are presented. In Orchidaceae separate keys to the subfamilies and in some of these to the tribes and genera are presented. Selected species are keyed out in Orchidaceae, Cyperaceae, and Gramineae. In the last family a separate key to the bamboos is given. No reference to page numbers is given in the keys. In general, the characters used for identification are adequate and not too technical.

N2  - Sustainable forest management is more than limiting harvesting volume of timber in tall forest areas. Reclamation and restoration of depleted forest areas is gaining importance as areas of remaining tall forest are diminishing. Irrespective of the causal factors be it unsustainable logging, mining or forest fires, secondary forest resulting from these activities deserve special attention. In East Kalimantan a wide variety of trees has been used for reforestation of areas affected by the devastating fires of 1982- 1983. These attempts involved exotic as well as indigenous species, and results varied considerably. The 1998 fires that raged through the area sadly destroyed most of the successful trials. Gradually emphasis of reforestation has shifted towards the use of indigenous species, which are obviously well adapted to the often very harsh conditions of secondary scrub vegetation. The problem is to find and identify these good alternatives.Identifying seedlings is often very difficult, as they may differ conspicuously in their general morphology from the adult stages and many distinguishing characters are often not yet present (e.g. characters of flowers and fruits). In this manual a selection of the secondary forest tree species as encountered in various areas of East Kalimantan is presented. Circumstances resulting from the 1998 forest fires prevented a traditional approach of collecting seed from mother trees and raising seedlings under nursery conditions. Instead wildings were collected in various secondary habitats. Fruiting trees were relatively rare at the time of this study, which explains the absence of certain, less regularly fruiting, species in the book. However, this may well be considered a first selection concerning availability of planting material for reforestation purposes. Information on habitat and ecology is briefly mentioned, to give a first indication of suitability in reforestation. In December 1999 I had the opportunity to very quickly test the manual in the field in East Kalimantan. Grabbing seedlings along a roadside in badly depleted forest resulted in successful identification of the plants in over 90 percent of the material. Whereas the manual is intended for seedlings up to 6 months, identification of older plants worked remarkably well.

Eight species are recognized, including two new ones ( C. marthae and C. verrucosa). One name is reduced to synonymy. Four species formerly included by several authors in sect. Verrucosae (C. brachyptera, C. papillosa, C. parishii and C. virescens) are excluded. A total evidence analysis of morphological characters and ITS and matK sequence data supports the monophyly of the section as here recognized. Coelogyne virescens (sect. Brachypterae) is identified as nearest neighbour to the species of sect. Verrucosae. The number of sterile bracts on the rhachis and the shape of the ornamentation on the epichile appear to be phylogenetically informative characters, in contrast with the inflorescence type, ovary indumentum and number of keels on the hypochile.

The identification of species is difficult, especially of M. leucodermis and M. muticus. The two species are partly sympatric and only pistillate flowers or fruits provide reliable characters; specimens with staminate flowers are very difficult to identify.

N2  - This book contains a wealth of information on Monocotyledons. The papers are based on presentations at the Second International Conference on Comparative Biology of the Monocotyledons, Monocots II, held in Sydney, Australia in 1998, but many have been updated or extended to take into account new information.The book is divided into three main sections: General Comparative Biology of the Monocots (33 papers), Systematics of the Lilioides (18 papers), and Systematics of the Commelinoids (29 papers). General Comparative Biology of the Monocots covers the fields: Higher level systematics and new classifications; Biogeography and Fossils; Development and Organisation; Chemotaxonomy and Cytology; Anatomy and Embryology; and Reproductive biology. Systematics of the Lilioides contains accounts on Asparagales, Liliales, Orchidaceae, Dioscoreales, and Pandales. Systematics of the Commelinoids gives papers on Arecales (Palms), Commelinales, Poales (Bromeliaceae, Eriocaulaceae, Cyperaceae, Restoniaceae), and Zingiberales. As may be clear from the various fields covered in General Comparative Biology a very wide range of data sets is discussed. In the sections on Systematics most papers discuss systematics and phylogeny using phylogenies based on DNA sequences, macromorphological and anatomical characters.

N2  - Myrosma is a genus of rosulate herbs characterized by a compact and strongly monosymmetric inflorescence with conspicuous, white to pale green, mostly membranous bracts, in the axil of which is a single flower pair. The genus is widely distributed throughout Central Brazil, northern South America, and the Caribbean region.It occurs mostly in savannah environments but can also be found in humid and shaded habitats. We present a taxonomic revision of Myrosma recognizing a single species, Myrosma cannifolia L.f. A complete description of that species is provided with notes on its ecology, distribution, and variation. Three species and one variety are reduced into synonymy and four names are lectotypified. A complete nomenclatural account for all combinations including the name Myrosma is given.

N2  - The genealogical relationships in the green algal genus Microspora (Chlorophyceae) are determined by phylogenetic analysis based on 15 ecological, morphological and reproductive characters. It is found that the traditional defining characters like cell shape and distinctness of the H-shaped pieces (composing the cell wall) play a major role in rooting of the cladograms and that species – forming a prominent rope-like growth habit in rapid streams – are closely related. It is suggested that the pH value of the habitat proves to give a more substantial phylogenetic signal than the type of water movement.

N2  - This long-awaited volume is the last of the new Flora of New Zealand and treats 121 genera in 21 tribes with 460 species, of which 226 are introduced and 46 ‘transient’, i.e. introduced but not persisting, against 188 native ones of which not less than 157 are endemics. Most of the latter belong to the Poeae (49 + 41 others), Agrostideae (45 + 58) and Danthonieae (43 + 15) showing the present temperate nature of the grass flora. This structure of the grass flora is briefly discussed, but its origin is considered ‘unsuited to a flora’. It is a pity that no reference is given to a place where this is done, instead.Of general interest to the New Zealand Flora is the extensive literature list (‘annals’) completing the ones given in previous volumes with indices on families and additional scientific subjects. Curiously, they run up to 1996, while elsewhere (p. xxix) references as late as 1999 are indexed. M.I. Dawson contributed a survey of the chromosome numbers of indigenous species. It may be noted that for Lachnagrostis filiformis 2n = 28 and 56 have been reported, although Edgar  Connor say no chromosome numbers are known for the genus (p. xxiv).

N2  - In September 1981, seeds of Arisaema were harvested by Carla Teune, Hortus Botanicus Leiden, near Liuba, area of Mt Minya Konka (Gonga Shan), Szechuan (Sichuan) Province, China, at 3600 m altitude. During the trip, with Roy Lancaster and others, no pressed herbarium specimen was collected. Michael Hoog, who runned a well known Dutch Nursery, was given five lots of seed numbered CT 368 to CT 372, all provisionally labeled A. consanguineum Schott. All numbers were collected the same day along the same path. After the seedlings flowered, it appeared there was no reason to keep them separate; they were merged and distributed in the trade as Arisaema CT 369 (Antoine Hoog, 1998, private communication).The following Latin description of A. ciliatum H. Li var. liubaense var. nov. corresponds to specimens widespread in culture as Arisaema CT 369. As well known, the name of A. ciliatum H. Li refers to the presence of some cilia along the mouth of the spathe-tube (Fig. 1). The spadix is apically softly spiny and a few neuters are in general present at the base of the appendage. The colour of the spathe is described by Li as “purple with light green conspicuous stripes” (Wu  Li, 1979), but in the wild the prevailing colour of the spathe varies from red to green and, moreover, the species showed itself later to be stoloniferous. Arisaema CT 369 also shares this character with A. ciliatum and not with A. consanguineutn (which does not develop stolons). The link made previously between Arisaema CT 369 and A. consanguineutn has to be discarded. Arisaema CT 369 falls into the range of A. ciliatum. Nevertheless, Arisaema CT 369 is easily differentiated from the typical A. ciliatum as some reliable differences are visible in the spathe. The main difference is found along the margin of the tube mouth: in Arisaema CT 369, the cilia of the typical species are lacking along the margin of the tube mouth even if this margin is not perfectly smooth, the spadix-appendix is more exserted from the tube and its extremity is not spiny (Fig. 2,3). As opposed to the typical species, one can add that the colour of the spathe is invariably purple with greenish white longitudinal stripes. Up to now, no seedlings with a greenish spathe have been observed. These characters are stable and Carla Teune’s specimens come true from seed.

N2  - Another impressing volume of the Flora of Australia, dealing with the ferns, Gymnosperms and allied groups. Chapters on morphology, a glossary of botanical terms used, and a list of abbreviations and contractions make this work accessible also for non specialists. Moreover, the many illustrations, colour photographs as well as line drawings, provide a good help with identification (figure 151 is a colour photo that probably depicts two species of Pyrrosia). For the Gymnosperms an introduction is given of the evolution of the system of seed plants, and cladograms are given of the Cycadophyta, of Cycas, and of Cycas subsect. Endemicae.In such a large work mistakes are inevitable. In the key to the families of ferns in lead 27 opposite characters are: Stipe articulated to a phyllopodium and Stipe not articulated to a leaf-like outgrowth of the rhizome. Not only that the same terms should be used, but a leaf-like outgrowth of the rhizome is a rather strange interpretation of a phyllopodium. In other places in the key this is also used. The last sentence under Crypsinus simpliccimus (p. 473) reads: “A very widespread fern and quite variable in form.” This for a fern of very restricted occurrence (on the map only one dot to be seen). Possibly this sentence belongs under the genus.

N2  - The three closely related genera Aleurites J. R. Forst.  G. Forst., Reutealis Airy Shaw and Vernicia Lour., together constituting the subtribe Aleuritinae of the tribe Aleuritideae (Euphorbiaceae subfamily Crotonoideae), are revised. Originally included in Aleurites, Reutealis and Vernicia are considered generically distinct on account of differences in the indumentum, leaf base, inflorescences, number of stamens and fruit type. This distinction has also been confirmed by a recent phylogenetic analysis. Aleurites (2 species) differs from Reutealis and Vernicia by the more numerous stamens arranged in 4 rather than in 2 whorls, and the indehiscent fruits. The monotypic genus Reutealis can easily be distinguished from Aleurites and Vernicia by its five-angular or five-ribbed rather than terete twigs, the presence of rather persistent, hooded bracts, and spatulately flattened rather than terete stigmas. Vernicia (3 species) differs from the other two genera by its large and showy flowers arranged in corymbiform rather than in pyramidal thyrses and the lack of stellate hairs. Moreover, in Vernicia lobed leaves show conspicuous glands at the nadir of each sinus while in Aleurites these glands are absent (leaves of Reutealis are never lobed).

N2  - The Hippomaneae (Euphorbiaceae) are revised for Malesia. Only Excoecaria and Homalanthus are excluded. A key to all Malesian genera is provided. The generic concepts applied differ markedly from previous treatments for the region with the following genera accepted: Balakata, Falconeria, Gymnanthes, Microstachys, Sapium, Shirakiopsis, Stillingia and Triadica. All of these genera show peculiarities in biogeography and ecology, which are discussed. Among these genera only Stillingia is kept as traditionally used. Balakata (based on Sapium sect. Pleurostachya) and Shirakiopsis (based on Sapium sect. Parasapium but excluding its type) are described as new genera; Falconeria, Microstachys and Triadica are re-established as distinct genera having been treated as Sapium sect. Falconeria, Sebastiania sect. Microstachys and Sapium sect. Triadica for a long time. Gymnanthes is cited for the first time in Malesia based on two former species of Sebastiania, and the African genus Duvigneaudia is united with it. Sapium and Sebastiania are no longer considered as indigenous to Malesia, with Sapium (= Sapium sect. Americana) formerly being cultivated.Altogether 13 species are accepted in the present revision. No new species are described, but only two of the well-known names are accepted as previously used (Sapium glandulosum, Stillingia lineata subsp. pacifica). Numerous new combinations are proposed in the present revision: Balakata baccata, Balakata luzonica, Gymnanthes borneensis, Gymnanthes inopinata, Gymnanthes remota, Shirakiopsis indica, Shirakiopsis sanchezii, Shirakiopsis virgata. Several other, previously available but uncommon names are re-introduced, namely Falconeria insignis, Microstachys chamaelea, Triadica cochinchinensis (the correct name for the former Sapium discolor), and Triadica sebifera. Finally, two new synonyms are proposed by uniting Sebastiania lancifolia with Gymnanthes borneensis, and Sapium plumerioides with Stillingia lineata subsp. pacifica. Lectotypes are selected for eight names.

N2  - Volume 3 represents a change in style for Flora Malesiana Series II, not just in the different coloured cover complete with illustration, but also in its stand-alone format. Each family, genus and species is described, and keys are provided for genera and species. For the two largest genera Microsorum (31 species) and Selliguea (49 species) regional keys to species are included in addition to the main key to species in Malesia. In total 228 species are described as follows: Polypodiaceae (183 species), Davalliaceae (31 species), Azollaceae (1 species), Cheiropleuriaceae (1 species), Equisetaceae (1 species), Matoniaceae (4 species) and Plagiogyriaceae (7 species). There is interesting discussion of regional variation within some of the more widespread species. The distribution of each taxon is given, but for Davalliaceae this should be extended to the north of the North Island of New Zealand where a new subspecies of Davallia tasmani was discovered more than ten years ago.The illustrations include 35 line drawings, mainly of Polypodiaceae, 4 plates of SEM photographs and 7 photographs of herbarium sheets.

N2  - A cladistic analysis, based on a taxonomic revision is carried out for 7 Acanthophora species using 19 characters. Hypotheses on species affinities are based primarily on morphological characters. Because most species show only few distinctive characters, emphasis was placed on features of spine development, either in relation to vegetative or to reproductive structures. Global distribution of 7 Acanthophora species: viz. A. aokii, A. dendroides, A. muscoides, A. nayadiformis, A. pacifica, A. ramulosa, and A. spicifera, shows a discontinuous pattern. Although widely distributed species are present (A. muscoides and A. spicifera), a disjunct distribution of other species occurs in the Pacific (A. aokii), Indian Ocean (A. dendroides), East-Atlantic region (A. ramulosa), and the Mediterranean and Red Sea (A. nayadiformis). Information on the historical background of the species distribution can be inferred from the obtained phylogenetic tree.

N2  - A joint project of the National Herbarium, Addis Ababa University, and the Department of Systematic Botany, Uppsala University, the Ethiopian Flora Project that was launched in 1980, continues to produce results since the first volume (in fact Vol. 3) was published. Many efforts have gone into fund raising, and SIDA, the Swedish International Development Cooperation (earlier SAREC), and the Ethiopian Government have contributed considerable sums of money to achieve the publication of the Flora of Ethiopia and Eritrea.The editorial team in Uppsala, Addis Ababa and Eritrea has to be congratulated that within two years after the appearance of both volumes of 1995 another issue has left the press. In this extremely rich flora region, with altitudes ranging from below sea level to 4413 m above with a multitude of climatological areas and niches a complete Flora that works has been sorely missed. Endemism is considerable. After a rather slow start, not in the last place caused by political and financial reasons, the authors have apparently contributed their shares at a much more rapid pace. The history of the organization of the writing of the Flora of Ethiopia has been elaborated in the first volume which appeared, no. 3 (Flora of Ethiopia), and the other volumes (Flora of Ethiopia and Eritrea) report on the progress made. In the title the independence of Eritrea since 1993 is reflected. Taxon 41 (1992) 403 provided scant information for Vol. 3.

N2  - Genus Maerua has around 60 species represented on the African continent, of which three have been reported for Angola. Two new species of Maerua (Capparaceae) from Angola are here described. Both are closely similar to M. juncea subsp. juncea, being distinguished by floral traits such as the receptacle, androphore and gynophore (M. pintobastoae) or leaf traits such as venation, as well as size and shape of the ovary and disc shape (M. mendesii). A key for Maerua species occurring in Angola is provided, as well as a table summarizing and comparing the morphological characters for the new species and similar African species. With the description of these two new species, the genus Maerua comprises five species in Angola.Resumo O género Maerua tem cerca de 60 espécies representadas no continente Africano, das quais 3 foram já reportadas para Angola. São aqui descritas duas novas espécies de Maerua (Capparaceae) de Angola, ambas estreitamente semelhantes com M. juncea subsp. juncea, da qual diferem por carateres florais como o recetáculo, andróforo e ginóforo (M. pintobastoae) ou por caracteres foliares como nervação, bem como tamanho e forma do ovário e forma do disco (M. mendesii). Apresenta-se uma chave das espécies de Maerua que ocorrem em Angola, bem como uma tabela comparativa das características morfológicas de cada uma das novas espécies com espécies africanas similares. Considerando as novas espécies descritas, o género Maerua compreende cinco espécies com ocorrência confirmada em Angola.

N2  - Although not the first publication validating the generic name Rafflesia, Robert Brown’s first classic paper on Rafflesia arnoldii was issued as a preprint in April 1821, antedating the publication of the possibly threatening name, R. titan Jack; Brown’s second paper on the genus was also first distributed as a preprint, in September 1844. New names first published in these papers are listed and remarks on the typification of Malesian species (two lectotypifications proposed) added. Rafflesia horsfieldii is apparently conspecific with R. patma, which, if proved, should prompt a move for the conservation of the later name R. patma. Precise datings for certain parts of the Proceedings and Transactions of the Linnean Society are presented and, as a result, it is necessary to propose a new combination, Thottea piperiformis (Griff.) Mabb. (Aristolochiaceae).

N2  - After his work on the Neotropical species of Caesalpinia (Lewis, 1994; PhD thesis) Lewis was able to recognise broad morphological groups within Caesalpinia s.l. He carried out a preliminary cladistic analysis to show the evolutionary relationships within this complex group (Lewis  Schrire, 1995). The group revised in this excellent book is one of the clades in this analysis and comprises the sections Poincianella and Erythrostemon of Caesalpinia s.l. The revision is not only based on herbarium study, but also on extensive field work in Mexico, Central America, Cuba, and Brazil. Living material of 33 taxa was studied, offering many new characters.The book contains an extensive taxonomic history of the genus showing the difficulties of previous workers with genus delimitation. For the Poineianella-Erythrostemon ‘group’ the nomenclatural confusion is cleared up, but for the other species confusion will persist until they have all been studied across their full geographical ranges. In addition to the complex relations in the genus itself, part of the nomenclatural problems are caused by additional names introduced by regional Flora writers for species with a wide geographical range. Furthermore, there is a morphological section with emphasis on the group in this revision but with links to the variation in Caesalpinia s.l. Shorter sections on seed chemistry, insects, pollen, chromosomes, and biogeography are given at the end of the general part. The largest part of the book consists of the systematic section with the revision of the Poineianella-Erythrostemon ‘group’, a key to the species within the group, and a key to the groups within Caesalpinia s.l. and the related genus Hoffmannseggia in the Neotropics.

N2  - In this book a number of general topics of island biogeography are discussed mainly on the basis of case studies dealing with three archipelagos: The Hawaiian Islands (two chapters); the Juan Fernandez Islands (three chapters) and the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands (three chapters). Two chapters deal with, respectively, Ullung Island and the South Pacific Islands. The remaining three chapters are all part of the section on general evolutionary patterns and processes. Except in some of these last chapters, there are no references to islands outside the Pacific Basin.The depth of treatments ranges from general discussions based primarily on literature studies (such as G. D. Carr’s discussion of chromosome evolution in Hawaiian flowering plants, which is nearly entirely based on data extracted from Wagner, Herbst  Sohmer, 1990; or Bohm’s review of secondary compounds in chapter 11), to a detailed analysis of single genera (Setoguchi et al.’s chapter on evolution in Crossostylis).

N2  - A phylogeny of the complete tribe Chrozophoreae is presented in order to establish the possible monophyly and relationships in subtribes Chrozophorinae (Chrozophora) and Doryxylinae ( Doryxylon, Melanolepis, Sumbaviopsis, Thyrsanthera). Added are the other subtribes in tribe Chrozophoreae, the Speranskiinae (Speranskia) and Ditaxinae ( Argythamnia, Caperonia, Chiropetalum, Ditaxis, Philyra). Outgroups are the genera Agrostistachys and Chondrostylis (tribe Agrostistachydeae).The phylogeny shows two monophyletic groups, subtribe Speranskiinae together with Ditaxinae, and subtribe Chrozophorinae with Doryxylinae. The latter group is statistically well supported by a high bootstrap value. The first group is weakly supported and collapses easily when the characters are selected somewhat differently. The former subtribes Chrozophorinae and Doryxylinae are united into one subtribe, Chrozophorinae. The remaining taxa in tribe Chrozophoreae, the monogeneric subtribe Speranskiinae and subtribe Ditaxinae are united into subtribe Ditaxinae. Within subtribe Chrozophorinae s.l. Chrozophora is sister taxon to all other taxa, followed by Thyrsanthera and Melanolepis. Doryxylon and Sumbaviopsis were apparently the last to separate. The differences between all, mainly monotypic, genera are quite large, therefore, the present delimitation is favoured over a suggested union of Doryxylon and Sumbaviopsis.

N2  - As part of the great global movement of plants in the 18th and 19th centuries, many valuable and commercial plants were sent from the Neotropics to Europe as seeds or as live specimens. Cecropia (Urticaceae) was in cultivation in England in 1789, yet species delimitation was not well-understood until much later, long after subsequent introductions to other tropical regions where alien populations are now invasive. The earliest record of Cecropia being cultivated in Malesia is based on material of C. peltata thought to have been sent from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew to ’s Lands Plantentuin (Buitenzorg) in Jawa, Indonesia, sometime between 1862 and early 1868. In 1902, C. peltata was first cultivated in the botanical gardens of Singapore and introduced to Peninsular Malaysia in 1954. The source of these latter introductions is uncertain. Many researchers have assumed that C. peltata is the only species of Cecropia introduced in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. We confirm that C. peltata is naturalised in Singapore and is invasive on the island of Jawa, Indonesia, and in Peninsular Malaysia.However, a second introduced species, C. pachystachya, has also been discovered as invasive in both Jawa and Singapore. There is no evidence for the third previously introduced species, C. palmata, being extant in Malesia.

N2  - During an agrostological survey in the Lam Dong Province, Vietnam, Mr. J.B. Hacker (St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia) collected a remarkable undescribed species of Digitaria. Among the Asian taxa it is peculiar because of its montane provenance coupled with a combination of an inflorescence with well-developed common axis with alternate racemes, the presence of a small lower glume, and the absence of any indument on the spikelet. Somewhat similar is D. wallichiana (Steud.) Stapf, also a montane species occurring with one subspecies in Sri Lanka and Madras, and another in Java and Bali. It differs by the whorled lowermost branches of the inflorescence, the absent lower glume, and a longer upper glume (1.6-2 mm long, 0.8-0.95 times as long as the spikelet), and a usually presence of an indument on the spikelet.The spikelets are surprisingly similar to those of the rare Vietnamese species Panicum amoenum Balansa and P. smithii M.M. Rahman, but these have a much larger habit with larger inflorescences, long-pedicelled spikelets, large and nerved lower glumes, and an indurated fertile lemma in fruit. Hacker’s specimens do not have mature fruits, but the paired spikelets with short and somewhat longer pedicels are typical for binate Digitaria species and not for a Panicum.

N2  - This important book, written in somewhat baroque and not always clear English, provides a wealth of information for all those studying or working with Cyanoprokaryotes. That are the organisms usually known as Cyanobacteria or still just bluegreen algae. A modern book on identification, but only on the unicellular or colonial members, not on the important filamentous groups. Two parts will follow later. Although in the ‘Anschrift der Authoren’ it is indicated that Professor Anagnostidis has died, no further information is given about that sad event.The introduction is very important for users and reviewers. The editors printed in bold “Please, read this chapter” and they are right. Without reading this no-one would know that the book contains “a review of all Cyanoprokaryotic taxonomic units, registered and recognisable from European natural biotopes, including marine coasts.” And that “non-European species and species with vague taxonomic descriptions are listed under the appropriate genera.” The book was written for identification and standardisation of morphologically and ecologically distinguishable European Cyanoprokaryotes, that have been described from natural populations. The keys and taxonomic descriptions in the book permit identification of natural populations and some culture material; however, they are less suitable for identification of non-European specimens. Moreover, according to the authors, “identification of strains without previous knowledge of natural material needs to be studied with special care, because only a few Cyanoprokaryotes keep their typical form in culture.” The authors strongly dissuade the use of taxon names to include specimens or strains that deviate from features that are characteristic for “any higher taxon”. And they warn: “If the incorrect name is accepted, all the information about any given population or strain is a priori wrong.” And “Identification of any species is correct only if your material corresponds fully (in all characteristics, including ecology) with the description. The variability of species can be broader than described in the book, but you must be convinced of the taxonomic identity of your material.”

N2  - A new species is described in Tetrapetalum, a small genus of which two species have been known. Although Van Heusden (1992) stated that Tetrapetalum differs from Cyathostemma only in its dimerous flowers, Tetrapetalum seems to be more closely related with Uvaria than with Cyathostemma, because of spreading petals and unlobed stigmas. A key to the three species of Tetrapetalum is provided here.

N2  - The three volumes of this publication contain the results of almost five years of fieldwork over a period of almost 15 years in the Simbu Valley in the Central Highlands of Papua New Guinea.Volume I, ‘The People and their plant-lore’, contains an introduction to the Simbu people, as well as a discussion of their classification and naming of plants [the latter very useful reading for (ethno)botanists]. The main part is formed by an annotated alphabetical list of Simbu plant names. For each vernacular name the translation or interpretation and the botanical determination are given. Furthermore tribe names (for names used by specific tribes), the name of the species in other languages, and (for part of the names) the Simbu names of cultivars are provided. The list also contains general terms, for example for parts of plants. Because of the compact way in which Sterly presents the data, the reader will need some practising before being able to use the book. This is also the case for volumes II and III. Several maps are provided, with the location of villages, rivers and mountains, the tribe distribution, and a vegetation map. Volume I contains the list of references for all three volumes.

N2  - Shirakia (Euphorbiaceae) was described by Hurusawa (1954) with three species. It was named after Croton shiraki, a nomen nudum used by Siebold  Zuccarini (1843) for the species currently known as S. japonica (Siebold  Zucc.) Hurus. Kruijt (1996) transferred five additional species to Shirakia. Esser et al. (1998) showed that S. japonica, the type, differs in several characters from the remainder of the genus. In a phylogenetic analysis they concluded that all additional species have to be removed to other genera ( Shirakiopsis Esser ined., Triadica Lour.), with Shirakia remaining as a monotypic genus endemic to Japan and adjacent East Asia.The name, however, is a later homonym of Shirakia S. Kawasaki, a fern fossil described in 1934 from South Korea. This information is included in the WWW version of the Index Nominum Genericorum (Farr  Zijlstra, 1996 and onward). Because this earlier homonym was published in a publication of very restricted distribution, it was overlooked by recent workers (Kruijt, 1996; Esser et al., 1998). Gea Zijlstra and John Wiersema kindly confirmed that a new name is still necessary for Shirakia Hurus., and this is provided herewith.

N2  - A cladogram of the subtribe Lasiococcinae (Homonoia, 2 species, Lasiococca, 3 species, and Spathiostemon, 2 species) is presented with the genus Wetria as outgroup. All three taxa are monophyletic groups of species with Lasiococca and Spathiostemon as sistergroups and Homonoia related to both of them. Within Lasiococca, L. comberi and L. malaccensis are probably closest related. The two species of Homonoia are rheophytes, one is restricted to India where it shows two distinct forms, the other species is widespread from India throughout Malesia. Lasiococca is represented by one species in Malesia, L. malaccensis, only known from three localities, ranging from the Malay Peninsula to Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands. Spathiostemon has two species in Malesia, one is widespread in Malesia, the other one is restricted to part of Peninsular Thailand. Clonostylis, a monotypic genus only known from the Sumatran type specimen, is not synonymous with Spathiostemon. Clonostylis is seemingly most similar to Mallotus and Macaranga. Ricinus, also a monotypic genus, is introduced to Malesia and is generally cultivated. It is not part of the Lasiococcinae. The presence of phalanged stamens, also typical for the Lasiococcinae, is a parallel development as Ricinus shows many more androphores and the connective is often appendaged. Ricinus cannot readily be classified and retaining it in its present monotypic subtribe seems to be the best solution. Wetria shows two species in Malesia. One is restricted to West Malesia, the other one is found in New Guinea and appears to be similar to the recently described W. australiensis of Queensland.

N2  - The two published parts of the Desmid Flora of Austria are well-illustrated review volumes on a group of precious freshwater microalgae. Volume 1 contains a pretty, visual key to the genera, completed by figures of one or more characteristic species. In all keys of the separate genera many visual aids are included, resulting in userfriendly identification tools. In the taxonomic part of volume 1 the paragraphs on species and infraspecific taxa include the scientific name, an abbreviated reference to authors, a reference to the drawing given in this Flora, synonymy based on literature of Austrian desmids, a short description, and a note on distribution of the taxon in Austria, often together with some information on its environment. For the general classification a publication by Ruzicka is used. It is a pity, however, that a reference to that publication is lacking. In volume 2, a different system for coding of dimensions is introduced. Another change is the inclusion to references to international scientific literature, still without full citation of these works, however.Although most of the contents are painstaking precise, some slovenliness is apparent in the set-up of this Flora. In volume 2 some of the omissions in the list of references on occurrence of desmids in Austria are corrected, but still a list of general references is not included. Especially in relation to the incomplete citation of references that are used as a basis for some of the drawings, these omissions may cause legalistic debate.

N2  - Judging from the title this would be a book for a distinctly limited audience. After all, only very few of the more than 430 South African orchid species are in general cultivation. For two reasons that judgement would be wrong. First, many South African orchids deserve to be much more widely cultivated. This book may be considered an excellent promotion for these beautiful but neglected species. Second, this book could well be described as an up-to-date guide to orchid growing, where the examples happen to be South African species. Especially valuable is the detailed information on cultivating terrestrial species. These are generally much more difficult to grow than the epiphytic ones, and most of the advice given here applies just as well to Australian and Mediterranean orchids. Propagating orchids by sowing is given extensive coverage, down to a blueprint for building your own laminar flow cabinet. All the information is very clearly represented, with many instructive photographs. The colour photographs are excellent, and the book is well-produced, although I personally dislike blank margins as wide as 5 cm, as they are here.This book is warmly recommended, not only to those who are attracted by the subject of the title, but to all who are seriously interested in cultivating and propagating terrestrial orchids.

N2  - Sections and macerations of roots and stems of Orchidantha maxillarioides (Ridl.) K. Schum. (Lowiaceae) were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Vessels with long scalariform perforation plates occur in both roots and rhizome; perforation plates have more pit membrane remnants in rhizomes. At least a few tracheids are present. The degree of perforation plate specialization correlates with the moist forest understory habit of Orchidantha, and is similar to that in primitive families of monocotyledons that occupy marshy habitats. Vessel data suggest a primitive position for Lowiaceae within Zingiberales in accordance with recent phylogenies of monocotyledons, but recent molecular data point to a position more nearly terminal in the clade; this situation needs resolution. Raphides are figured with SEM, as are starch grains with rounded outlines, the shape of the latter newly reported for Lowiaceae.

N2  - Non-timber forest products receive, to quote the first words of the introduction (Chapter 1) of this book, “wide attention throughout the tropics.” It has repeatedly been said that they could play an important economical and social role in regional development, and it has been implied or stated that developing countries would do wise in furthering such a role and to recognize the sustainable exploitation of non-timber forest products as a preferable alternative for the non-sustainable timber exploitation as practised now in most tropical countries. This is the second publication in the Tropenbos Series on nontimber forest products. It focuses on a part of Borneo and explores the potential value of these products for the area studied.The vegetation of the area is described in Chapter 2 where also each species found is awarded an ‘importance value index’. This is the sum of relative density, relative dominance and relative frequency, and is a measure of the (numeric) importance of the species in the vegetation. Its use in the context of non-timber forest products is not so obvious.

N2  - This book intends (according to the preface) to afford at once a review, a general outline of what has been accomplished, and a set of signposts for the future. It attempts to do so in three sections on Origin and Diversification of Primitive Land Plants (4 papers), Origin and Diversification of Angiosperms (6 papers), and Speciation and Mechanisms of Diversification (5 papers).In a sense our discipline is in a state of change that could be called revolutionary, rapidly acquiring new facts. In this situation the need is felt for a survey of what has been accomplished and what the future may bring. This slim volume serves as a prime example of an attempt to do so. It covers phylogenetic fields: early land plants, Pteridophytes, conifer families, Angiosperms from various angles (flower evolution, fossil history of magnoliids, sequences in chloroplast and ribosome genes, pollen characters, chromosome evolution), and some papers on speciation mechanisms. However, built as it is by 24 authors in 15 chapters often repeating in a wider context what they have published earlier, the book does not give a balanced review. It also regrettably lacks a good summary in which the different specialist approaches are melted into one view.

N2  - With the sudden and untimely death of Kees Kalkman on 19 January 1998, systematic botany in general and the Rijksherbarium/Hortus Botanicus in particular lost a great servant. The word servant is appropriate, because in a totally unselfish and very conscientious way Kalkman carried out all the duties associated with the various functions he held during his distinguished career. Kalkman’s busy schedule was filled by doing things that were useful for others and for projects or institutions he believed in.In an earlier note on the occasion of his retirement (Blumea 35 [1991] 277-278), I have briefly sketched Kalkman’s career and stressed his important role as Director, first of the Rijksherbarium, and later of the Research Institute Rijksherbarium/Hortus Botanicus. With the passing of time it is becoming increasingly evident how Kalkman’s strategic planning and actions have benefited the institute and systematic botany in Leiden.

N2  - This inventory covers 86 different species of Corallinales (calcareous red algae) that are recorded as having been found in the Mediterranean. Of these, however, 33 species have rarely been observed, or cannot be classified under an accepted name, leaving a discussion of biogeography of 53 species. For each of these 53 species the synonyms are listed and a characterization is given of world distribution and occurrence. Maps are presented of all localities from where these species have been recorded according to a critical assessment of 8043 records originating from 473 references published from 1837 onward. All relevant references are provided in geographically ordered lists. Where considered necessary, additional remarks are also included. New combinations are proposed in Titanoderma and Lithophyllum, while no taxonomic decisions were reached for the names Fosliella ischitana, Goniolithon papillosum and Leptophytum bornetii. In some cases taxon names occur as synonyms under different accepted names, as, amongst others, is the case for Tenarea tortuosa, of which the name can also be found as a synonym under Lithophyllum lichenoides.It is rather odd to perceive that the discussion, which is in fact the biogeographic analysis, has clearly not been made by the same person that composed the inventory. The list of 53 discussed species in this discussion chapter is not exactly corresponding to the floristic list given in the paragraph on materials and methods. Thus Lithophyllum duckeri, Lithophyllum (Goniolithon) rubrum and Leptophytum bornetii occur in the floristic list of reviewed species, but are not incorporated in the table on distribution. On the other hand, however, Goniolithon (Lithophyllum) papillosum, Lithothamnion propontidis and Fosliella ischitana, all listed as “dubiae aut rariter inventae” in the floristic list, are nevertheless included in the discussion on distributions. Lithothamnion minervae, which is printed boldface in the floristic list, is even missing in the index. Another somewhat irritating and unexplained difference between both parts of the book is the uncorrelated division of the Mediterranean in (bio)geographical sectors, resulting in unnecessary complications.

Of the first subfamily 22 genera with 126 species are treated, of the second 16 genera with 43 species are dealt with. Each (sub)family is described and keys to the genera are given, as are keys to the species in various genera. In the species-rich genus Senna several cases of interspecific hybridisation are acknowledged by naming up to 15 ‘form taxa’ without any taxonomic status.This handsome volume is produced along the well known lines of the Flora of Australia format and standards. It is illustrated with 78 colour photographs, 96 line drawings, and 188 maps.

N2  - The genus Strophioblachia Boerl. is very variable, but does not show any gaps in characters, which can be used for a further delimitation of taxa. This is shown for characters like habit, leaf blade shape, leaf blade base, staminate petals and disc lobes, bracts, and the fimbriae of the pistillate calyx. The characters show their differences on the same specimen (e.g., leaf shape), within the same area (e.g., size and number of staminate petals), or in different areas of the distribution range (e.g., efimbriate pistillate calices in China, Thailand, and Sulawesi). Therefore, the formerly recognized species and varieties are united into a single accepted species, S. fimbricalyx.

N2  - The International Conference ‘Compositae: Systematics, Biology, Utilization’ held in 1994 inspired the authors, on the suggestion of Dr. K. Ferguson, to publish a book accommodating more general systematic papers on Asteraceae, resulting in the present work. It contains seventeen chapters [in English, French (1), and Spanish (1)], including the Introduction by C. Jeffrey, and is provided with a taxonomic index. Following the Introduction, Jeffrey gives a review of the developments in Asteraceae systematics during the last 20 years, since the conference of 1975. I agree with him that improvements are possible in the use of cladistic analysis in taxonomy, but it seems to me that his review is a bit too negative in this respect.Advances in Compositae Systematics presents studies at many different taxonomical levels, from macromorphology to molecular systematics and chemistry. The sequence of the chapters seems rather arbitrary; however, starting with a paper dealing with the origin of the Asteraceae seems very logical. In this chapter DeVore  Stuessy argue that the Asteraceae originated in late Eocene on the South America-Antarctica-Australia supercontinent. The Calyceraceae and Goodeniaceae would be families most closely related to the Asteraceae. DeVore  Stuessy used information on (pollen) morphology, present distribution, fossil records, and geology to reach their conclusions.

Lepisorus probably also belongs here, but is left out because this work started as a precursor for Flora Malesiana, and most Lepisorus species occur outside the Malesian area. The following genera, recognised by Bosman (1991), are reduced: Colysis (to Leptochilus), Neocheiropteris and Phymatosorus (to Microsorum). Many new combinations have been made. Microsorum hainanense is newly described and an evaluation is given of the main characters important for recognising species, viz. the venation and the arrangement of the sori.

N2  - In the framework of a revision of the genus Dictyota J.V. Lamour. in the Indian Ocean, all specimens from Indonesia present in the herbarium Weber-van Bosse (L) were re-examined. This resulted in a total of 9 species, one species including two different growth forms. Our identifications differ substantially from those of Weber-van Bosse (1913). Specimens recorded as D. apiculata J. Agardh were re-identified as D. crispata J.V. Lamour., which is the correct name for D. bartayresiana sensu Vickers; similarly was D. bartayresiana var. ß re-identified as D. cervicornis Kütz., D. fasciola (Roth) J.V. Lamour. as D. ceylanica Kütz. and D. ceylanica Kütz. var. rotundata Weber Bosse as D. friabilis Setch. Dictyota pardalis Kütz. considered as a distinct species by Weber-van Bosse (1913: 184), is treated as a synonym of D. cervicornis. In addition a new combination is made for a growth form of the latter, characterized by recurved branchlets: D. cervicornis f. pseudohamata (Cribb) De Clerck  Coppejans. Dictyota beccariana Zanardini is considered to be a synonym of D. ciliolata Sond. ex Kütz. A single specimen, previously assigned to D. beccariana, belongs to D. dumosa Børgesen. This is the first report of D. dumosa for the Malayan region. A new species, D. canaliculata De Clerck  Coppejans is described from preserved material, not reported in Weber-van Bosse (1913).

N2  - Omalanthus is revised for Malesia and the Solomon Islands. For this region, 13 species without subspecific taxa are accepted, namely O. arfakiensis, O. caloneurus, O. fastuosus, O. giganteus, O. grandifolius, O. longistylus, O. macradenius, O. nervosus, O. novoguineensis, O. populifolius, O. populneus, and O. trivalvis, and, as a new species, O. remotus. In addition to established synonyms, 17 species from Malesia are not accepted any more. The diagnostical importance of a peltate or non-peltate leaf base is especially doubted. Although detailed phylogenetic and biogeographical analyses were not made, the value of the established sections of Omalanthus is questioned. An alternative subdivision unites all Malesian taxa into four subgroups, each with a distinct distribution of probably historic causes. The subgroups are distributed in W and C Malesia, the Lesser Sunda Islands, the Philippines and the Bismarck Archipelago, and New Guinea and Australia, respectively. The radiation in montane and subalpine habitats may also have contributed to the actual diversity. In addition, O. gracilis from French Polynesia is proposed to be a synonym of O. stokesii.

N2  - A new species, Asplenium riswanii (sect. Thamnopteris), is described from Central Java and West Papua, Indonesia. It is distinct from any known species by having thick and rigid fronds, abaxially keeled midribs, broadly lanceolate scales, and distantly spaced sori. Morphologically, A. riswanii is not similar to any species from Malesia but somewhat close to A. antrophyoides from mainland Southeast Asia. Molecular data reveal it has an isolated position in the phylogeny. The micromorphology of spores and leaf epidermis of A. riswanii is also documented and a key to the species of Asplenium sect. Thamnopteris from Malesia is given.

N2  - As compared with the treatment in the Flora of Java (Backer in Backer  Bakhuizen van den Brink, 1963) with 8 species, a recent review of the genus Trichosanthes in Java resulted in the acceptance of 10 species for this island. Important changes are: the name T. trifolia has to be replaced by a later species name, T. wawrae Cogn.; T. anguina is a variety of T. cucumerina [T. cucumerina L. var. anguina (L.) Haines]; the name T. bracteata as used in the Flora of Java appeared to represent three other different species: T. tricuspidata Lour., T. quinquangulata A. Gray, and T. pubera Blume; and T. sumatrana Cogn., never recorded before, appeared to occur in Java.

N2  - This sixth supplement to the original and invaluable Index Filicum continues the tradition of cross-referencing all basionyms to their new names. It covers the period from 1976 to 1990, a mere 15 years in the nearly 250 years that separate us from Linnaeus. Yet it contains 344 pages full of new species and new combinations (statistics on the numbers of each category are not provided). The dates for this volume are not very strict: important publications before 1976 that were not fully indexed in the previous volume have been incorporated in the main body, not in the Addenda, Corrigenda et Emendanda (ACE). Compare, for instance, the mere 16 new combinations in Sphaeropteris made by R.M. Tryon in 1970 listed in the previous Supplement with the nearly 100 listed here! For the first time in pteridological history, pteridologists now also have access to infraspecific names, and have less excuse to ignore some of them quietly. Whether this is an advantage remains to be seen. Records only go back to 1976 (although some older infraspecific names are listed in the ACE), which means that lots and lots of older names (and all their corresponding autonyms) are still waiting to take up their proper place in the priority. With nomenclatural rules on infraspecific names as intricate as they are now, and without the excuse of ignorance, it is very temping to move away from the use of infraspecific categories altogether.

N2  - This important book contains a clear, modern introduction to the cytology, morphology and systematics of the algae, providing a wealth of information for all those studying or working with these organisms. It takes in account recent re-evaluations in algal systematics and phylogeny, and these two main fields are the most extensively covered. The re-evaluations have been made necessary by insights provided by molecular genetics, electron microscopy, and new life history studies.The introduction gives thought about classification, evolution and phylogeny and is directly followed by the chapters on the main algal groups. There the principal characteristics of each group are outlined, usually followed by chapters on size and distribution of the division, as well as on its structure and characteristics, its systematics, and its phylogeny. Occasionally only general remarks and some typical examples are discussed in smaller divisions, while in the two largest divisions, the Heterokontophyta and especially the Chlorophyta, many classes are treated separately.

N2  - Systematic botany is about the discovery, description, naming, and understanding of plant diversity. Of these four aspects the naming and describing of new species belongs to the most traditional, yet exciting activities of the plant taxonomist. On the occasion of the official opening of the Van Steenis Building by Her Majesty Queen Beatrix, we indulge in presenting species and one genus, new to science, and named to commemorate this auspicious event.The Van Steenis Building provides the new and highly functional premises for the Rijksherbarium, the Centre for Environmental Science, and the facilities for the undergraduate study of biology of Leiden University. Prof. Dr. C. G.G.J, van Steenis (1901-1986) was an unrivalled authority of Malesian botany but he also was a pioneer in tropical vegetation science, ecology and nature conservation. During his directorship of the Rijksherbarium (1962-1972) the institute flourished as never before. The moss species Dicranoloma steenisii Klazenga is named in his honour, and adds another taxon to the rich eponymy commemorating this great botanist. We are very honoured that his widow, Mrs. Van Steenis-Kruseman will be present at the opening ceremony. It may seem ironic that the inauguration of the building which carries Van Steenis’s name is celebrated with the launching of new taxa. The credo of Van Steenis was that we should endeavour to determine how few, not how many species are comprised in the flora of a region. Of course he was absolutely right in criticising the light-hearted description of new species on the basis of slightly deviating plant specimens. The new taxa presented here have nothing in common with these ephemeral blemishes on botanical nomenclature; they are good and distinct species recognised by specialists from the ‘Leiden School’, who are renowned for their tendency to lump rather than to split.

N2  - In 1965 the late Mr. J. Daams, an ardent and acute fungus collector, discovered in a greenhouse at ’s Graveland, the Netherlands, a baffling small agaric with a very dark red-brown pileus, dark brown (sub)decurrent lamellae, a whitish veil partly covering pileus and stipe and a bitter to even acrid taste. The microscopic characters soon revealed that a rather aberrant species of Galerina was involved. In later years this species has been repeatedly found in greenhouses, but also outdoors in orchards, in the same region, always on compost or blackish soil, but after 1971 it has not been recorded again.A recent scanning of the literature on Galerina has shown that none of the nearly 300 species of this genus recognized in the world combines the characters of the present fungus.

N2  - The knowledge of the macrofungi (mushrooms and toadstools) in Europe, including the Netherlands, is still far from complete. During our studies on this group of organisms in the Netherlands and adjacent Belgium and Germany while preparing a critical identification work, the Flora agaricina neerlandica, a fairly large number of new species has been discovered, and a lot more has become known on the variability, distribution and ecology of the about 2,000 other species that will eventually be included in this Flora. In the period 1987-1996 four volumes have been completed of this standard work (Bas et al., 1988, 1990,1995,1996), three are in preparation, and we hope that early in the twenty-first century, the set of 10 volumes will be finished. The present paper deals with a very striking little Entoloma species recently discovered in Diever, province of Drenthe, the Netherlands.

In Microsorum several groups may be distinguished, all linked by one to several intermediate species. Microsorum aurantiacum finds its nearest allies in the group of species that formerly were distinguished as the genus Phymatosorus. Although the type, which is also the only collection as yet, was collected already in 1909, reportedly with many duplicates, it remained unnamed, sitting in the herbarium of Berlin. It is easily distinguished from its allies in the nearly circular leaves with very narrow lobes.

N2  - In a revision of the Malesian representatives of the genus Selliguea (Polypodiaceae) several recently collected specimens form Borneo were found to represent a very distinct, but hitherto undescribed species. From the few collections seen so far, it appears that the new species is not a very narrow endemic, and the fact that it has only been collected after 1970 probably is an indication of the increasingly intensive exploration of Borneo in recent times.In so far as the specimens had been identified, the names S. feei Bory and S. heterocarpa (Blume) Blume had been applied. In general habit, the species is closest to S. heterocarpa, but can be distinguished by the following characters: Selliguea heterocarpa — Rhizome 2-4 mm thick; rhizome scales peltate, 5-8.5 by 1-1.4 mm, straw-coloured to dull brown, with a thick, almost spongy pseudocosta, remotely and weakly dentate at base, entire towards the apex. Hydathodes frequent, margin without notches. Sori forming transversal coenosori, slightly to (usually) deeply sunken. Selliguea sri-ratu — Rhizome 4-8 mm thick; rhizome scales pseudopeltate, 7-13 by 1.2-2.5 mm, brown, without pseudocosta, strongly dentate. Hydathodes absent or infrequent, margin regularly notched. Sori round, elongated or sometimes confluent into a transversal coenosorus, superficial.

N2  - On a field trip into the interior of Sabah, Borneo, in 1986, a small Bulbophyllum species (Orchidaceae) without flowers was collected, and transferred to the greenhouse of Mr. P. Jongejan, Amersfoort, the Netherlands. Only after several years the plant rewarded the good care given to it with a few sprigs of flowers. It then appeared to be an undescribed species of great elegance, belonging to the section Hirtula Ridley. It displays an unusual combination of characters: it has a distinctly elongated lip, as is found in B. jolandae J.J. Vermeulen, and B. lasioglossum Rolfe, which both have an elongated inflorescence. The new species, however, has a subumbellate inflorescence, as occurs in B. carinilabium J.J. Vermeulen, and B. hirtulum Ridley, which both have a shorter lip.

All occur in Borneo, which is evidently the centre of speciation of this genus; only Chelonistele sulphurea var. sulphurea occurs in addition in Java, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. During joint fieldwork in 1991 with staff of the Sarawak Herbarium in the Hose Mountains, Sarawak, the present author collected herbarium and live specimens of many orchids. Among the live orchids were quite a number of Chelonistele species from different habitats. Fifteen of these, belonging to six species, flowered in the Leiden Hortus Botanicus. Two are common and are well known from many herbarium specimens: C. sulphurea var. sulphurea and C. amplissima. Three were in 1986 known by a few specimens only: C. inglorio (7 specimens), C. unguiculata (3), and C. brevilamelluta (20). One species, in the field represented by a few specimens, appeared to be new to science, and is described here.

On further examination they turned out to belong to a new genus related to Parsonsia but differing from it in the stamens which are included within the corolla tube and the shape of the corolla, filaments and anthers. This is the second new genus recently discovered in Malesia, the first being Baharuia D.J. Middleton described from plants collected in Borneo and Sumatra.The name of the genus is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek reference to the funding for my work on Malesian Apocynaceae, the European Currency Unit or ECU. The genus was launched during the opening of the Van Steenis Building by Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on June 11, 1996.

N2  - Zonariophila semiendophytica is described as a new genus and species from the coast of the East Cape, South Africa. It is characterized by a single large elongate basal cell immersed in the thallus of Zonaria subarticulata (Lamour.) Papenf.; this laterally compressed cell gives rise, on both edges, to several short (up to 2.5 mm), uncorticated, erect, sparingly branched filaments. The position and structure of the procarp (the subapical cell in a determinate female fertile filament bears two sterile pericentral cells and one fertile pericentral cell, the latter with one sterile cell and a four-celled carpogonial filament), and the development of a single involucral filament from the hypogenous cell, put this genus in the immediate vicinity of Pleonosporium, and placement in the tribe Compsothamnieae is proposed.

N2  - Capparis buwaldae, a climber of primary forests endemic to Borneo, is a myrmecophyte with stem domatia. The stems become hollow by pith degeneration and develop oval openings allowing ants to enter. These openings are localized at a strictly defined area above the insertion of the leaves and a pair of nodal thorny stipules. They gradually split open from the outside. The openings may develop into elevated chimney-like structures or close again by growth if not kept open by ants.The plant may be inhabited by various opportunistically nesting arboreal ants including Crematogaster, Monomorium, and Camponotus species. Specialized myrmecophytic ants could not be found. Neither nectaries, nor food bodies, nor trophobiotic endophytic homopterans could be observed. In the Rijksherbarium, Leiden 65 other Capparis species and subspecies from the Indo-Australian region were examined for ant-plant characters. None of these species showed any myrmecophytic character.

N2  - A taxonomic revision of Bridelia Willd. for Southeast Asia is presented together with comments on the characters used, the biogeography of the species involved and the phytographic history of the genus. Nineteen species are recognised for the region (one from New Guinea was recently described as new). A key and full descriptions are provided. Maps illustrate the distribution of 15 species. Several distributional patterns were found which mainly reflect ecological requirements. The currently accepted infrageneric delimitation (especially on the sectional level) as proposed by Jablonszky (1915) seems no longer to meet the demands of modern taxonomy and is used here only as a handy working tool, but no attempt is undertaken to propose a new one.

N2  - The book contains 411 colour photographs of as many plant species (all Angiosperms). I estimate that about half of the species covered is not native to Sri Lanka, but introduced and sometimes run wild. That means that the pictures are highly representative for what one meets as a resident or as a visitor, in gardens, along the roads and in waste places. It also means that the book can be profitable in other tropical Asian countries.The arrangement is alphabetical by scientific names, which is of course very easy for those who know the names. It may be felt as a disadvantage by those who try to attach a name to a plant they have found. They will have to go through the entire book. In books like this the arrangement is often by flower colour which makes identification easier. The index on flower colour at the back of this book is not really an alternative.

The treatments of volumes 2 and 3 are each based on a doctor’s thesis by the first author, elaborated under supervision of Dr. Panigrahi.Volume 2 contains regional revisions of six genera: Prunus, Prinsepia, Maddenia, Rosa, Malus, and Pyrus. Prunus is taken in the inclusive sense and has 38 species in India, including a number of non-indigenous but cultivated and sometimes naturalized species. Prinsepia and Maddenia have one species each in the region covered. Rosa is a well represented genus in India and 37 species are recognized, including several non-native garden roses. Of the Maloideae only Malus (4 species) and Pyrus (4 species) are treated.

N2  - The number of orchid species in New Guinea is not easily estimated; there are many large, poorly studied genera, of which scores of undescribed species as well as many synonyms are waiting to be discovered. There may well be about 2500 species in all: almost double the size of the entire phanerogamous flora of the Netherlands! Only few recent publications (apart from taxonomic revisions of individual genera) are available to those who want to learn more about them. The most important is still the translation into English of Schlechter‘s 1914 classic ‘Die Orchidaceen von Deutsch-Neu-Guinea’, which appeared in 1982 as ‘The Orchidaceae of German New Guinea’. Unfortunately the Latin descriptions were not translated, and Schlechter’s illustrations consist exclusively of floral analyses. Then there is A. Millar’s ‘Orchids of Papua New Guinea, an introduction’ which has fine colour photographs but too many serious misidentifications to be of much use. Finally, the orchid part in volume 2 (1979) of Van Royen’s ‘Alpine Flora of New Guinea’ can be mentioned; this is restricted to species occurring above 3000 m and suffers from Van Royen’s extremely narrow species concept. On the positive side the latter work contains habit drawings of many species.Peter O’Byrne’s massive book is a very welcome addition. It consists largely of accurate descriptions and page-size pencil drawings, depicting habit as well as floral details of 269 species occurring below 1000 m in Papua New Guinea. Next to the descriptions there are many interesting observations on the individual species. Almost half of them are illustrated by good colour photographs. This book was written by the author, a chemistry teacher by profession, in his spare time in about five years while temporarily stationed in Papua New Guinea. This is a remarkable accomplishment, considering that, as we learn in the preface, in this period he had to teach himself to read botanical Latin, to draw plants and to learn many other things. Evidently he has been a good pupil of himself.

N2  - Goodyera subregularis (Rchb. f.) Schltr. from New Caledonia and Vanuatu is transferred to Anoectochilus. A non-peloric Anoectochilus, possibly the normal form of A. papuanus (Schltr.) Kittr., is recorded from New Guinea for the first time. Platylepis bombus J.J. Sm. and P. tidorensis J.J. Sm. are transferred to Moerenhoutia. The genus Tubilabium J.J. Sm. is reduced to Myrmechis Blume and the two species of the former are transferred. Cheirostylis quadrilobata Schltr. and C. chalmersii (Schltr.) Schltr. are also transferred to Myrmechis. The genus Myrmechis was not previously recorded from Sulawesi and New Guinea. Papuaea reticulata Schltr. is newly recorded from Irian Jaya; this monotypic genus is here illustrated for the first time. Odontochilus calcaratus Hook. f. is reduced to Pristiglottis uniflora (Blume) Cretz.  J.J. Sm.

N2  - This work is largely built on the papers from four symposia from the International Congress of Ecology, Yokohama 1990. It is an addition to volume 12 of the handbook of vegetation science dealing with the application of vegetation science in forestry, mostly in Europe. The critics of that volume would want a more diversified demonstration of forestry related vegetation science work and a wide representation of forest types from different continents. Well, they have got what they wanted, at least for Asia. Already in the first part, ‘Overview’, with three chapters [1. Forest ecosystems of East and Southeast Asia in a global perspective; 2. Climatic relations of the forests of East and Southeast Asia; 3. Species diversity in East Asia in a global perspective], the reader is confronted with a wealth of data he otherwise has to look for in several different places. Further parts are titled ‘Evergreen Forest Region’, ‘Summergreen Forest Region’, ‘Montane/Boreal Regions’, and ‘Tropical Forest Regions’. Each part is divided into several to many chapters (in the whole there are 35 chapters). In the different chapters the reader, who is especially sought under fieldworkers, finds a wealth of information on all aspects of vegetation science. One of the interesting things is that in several chapters, like that on ‘Alpine vegetation in a Global perspective’, the Asian vegetation is compared with the same vegetation in other continents. Concluding, it can be said that this book is obligatory for all students and workers in the field of forestry vegetation in Asia. Each chapter is provided with a lengthy list of references.

N2  - Coastal, psammophilous Spinifex littoreus, like other species of Spinifex, is dioecious in Indomalesia, but exceptions to dioecism are found in West Java, the Molucca Islands, and occasionally in the Philippines and northern Borneo. There dioecism has become degraded on the female side to trimonoecism, and sporadically to typical andromonoecism, through restoration of male fertility in some or all flowers. Interpretations of an androdioecious breeding system for Malesian S. littoreus are unsustainable.

N2  - This project of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh aims to provide regional manuals and on-line identification computer programs to the timber species of Dipterocarpaceae. The Singapore manual is a first trial, later editions should include other islands in the Malay Archipelago. The possibility is also offered to have tailor-made manuals for specific regions against cost price.Many data have been gathered, especially vegetative characters one can readily observe while standing underneath these enormous trees. In this respect the database will be very useful, because due to the very irregular flowering of the Dipterocarpaceae, flowers and fruits are usually unavailable, and even if they are present, they are found high in the tree.

N2  - With the death of Andre (‘Dok’) Kostermans, at the age of 88, a truly extraordinary personality has passed away. Dok had bravely borne the inconvenience of an increasing number of ailments associated with high age, such as poor eyesight, and had just recovered from a broken hip when his heart condition (angina pectoris) once more became acute. He passed away on 10 July, 1994 in a hospital in Jakarta where he had been transported one day before from his residence at Pasir Muncang, Gadok, some 15 km out of Bogor. His remains have been interred in the small historical cemetery within the Kebun Raya, by special permission of the Government of Indonesia.Kostermans can be ranked as one of the most important post-war Southeast Asian botanists and was the leading expert on Old World Lauraceae. Somewhat contrary to his stature, ‘Dok’ was physically strong; also he was industrious, intelligent, optimistic, and fluent in several languages, all qualities which doubtlessly guided him through a long and hazardous career. He worked hard as a scientist until shortly before his death. He was a controversial person, but liked and loved by many. Kostermans had a natural charisma, and easily established contact with his fellow human beings, irrespective of their political background, rank, class, colour, or nationality. He combined his kind nature with a strong will and determination.

Dendrophthoe curvata (Blume) Miquel is accepted as a distinct species. The status of Dendrophthoe falcata (L. f.) Ettingsh. is discussed, and the species is excluded from the Malesian flora. Dendrophthoe gangliiformis Barlow is described as a new species from Celebes, Alor and Tanimbar. A new combination, Dendrophthoe kerrii (Craib) Barlow, is made for the mainland Asian taxon Loranthus kerrii Craib. Dendrophthoe x rimituba Barlow is described as a new nothospecies endemic to Sumatra. A new combination, Dendrophthoe timorana (Danser) Barlow, is made for a species previously placed in the genus Amyema. Loranthus odoratus Wallich is recorded from Sumatra as a new genus and species for Malesia. Macrosolen brevitubus Barlow is described as a new species endemic to Borneo. The identity of Macrosolen melintangensis (Korthals) Miquel, a widespread species in western Malesia, is established. Trithecanthera sparsa Barlow is described as a new species endemic to Borneo.

In the developing flower the staminodes are initiated when the stamens are already distinctly differentiated into filament and anther. The probability of movements of the staminodes during anthesis is discussed. In the youngest stages observed the pistil is a single, apically open locule; the sept primordia on its wall are free from the pistil base. The septs grow towards the centre of the pistil. The concrescence of the septs is imperfect, resulting in open connections between the ovarial locules and towards the stigma.

N2  - This should be the start of a really great enterprise: A cyclopedia of the woody plants of the world. This first installment includes, apart from some introductory chapters, the full treatment of about 40 species. On an average each species gets some eight pages of text, including a short general introduction, a fairly extensive description in which special attention is paid to wood, bark, rooting, flowers, fruits, and seeds; the seedling is often represented by a clear drawing; further are given notes on distribution, dispersal, ecology, culture, diseases, and uses. The text is illustrated with several often fine colour photographs depicting habit, bark, sometimes wood, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds, some drawings, and a map of the area of distribution. Finally, the species is concluded by some general notes and by a list of additional literature. The text is well-printed on glossy, heavy, apparently strong paper. And strong it should be as the work is bound in a ring binder which makes it easy to add species, to replace sheets, and to arrange them your own way, but which on the other hand easily may wear out in such a probably frequently used work.The obvious first question regards the limitation: ‘der Holzgewächse’ means ‘of all the woody plants’; this seems rather much. The index mentions three groups, viz. trees from the Tropics and Subtropics, from the Temperate climate zones, and shrubs and subshrubs from Central Europe. Apart from the latter this is hardly a restriction. Only the word ‘Dendrologie’ in the subtitle and the fact that the majority of the many authors (as mentioned in the prospectus) are connected with forestry may point to economic importance as the main selection criterion. Skimming the species from this first installment learned that most are indeed of some use or other, some, however, of very local use only, and some were only formally used. Moreover, the experience of plant taxonomists is that nearly all plants seem to be of some use locally according to the field labels. The more than 20,000 trees mentioned in the ‘Vorwort’ apparently in principle ought to be included all. With the 30 species a year planned we will not live to see it completed!

The species exhibit a wide array of forms and highly localized geographic distributions. A systematic study of herbarium specimens revealed the existence of twelve species groups. A key to the species groups and species within each group, descriptions, illustrations, and habitat information are provided. The segregate genera Carionia, Cephalomedinilla, and Hypenanthe are treated here as congeneric with Medinilla. One new species, M. palawanensis, is described. Three new combinations and several reductions, neotypifications, and lectotypifications are proposed.

N2  - A description of Arytera pollen based on light and scanning electron microscopic observations is presented. Four aperture types and two ornamentation types (one divided into two subtypes) can be distinguished. The commonest aperture types are colporate and parasyncolporate; each of the other two types occurs in a single species. The main ornamentation types are rugulate and striate-rugulate; the latter has small or large lumina. Polymorphism occurs in both characters in several species. A cladistic analysis of Arytera shows two distinct evolutionary trends in the pollen: 1) aperture system from parasyncolporate to colporate, and 2) ornamentation from striate-rugulate with small lumina to striate-rugulate with large lumina. The plesiomorphic state of the character ornamentation remains uncertain. The result obtained contributes to the doubt whether primitively colporate pollen occurs within the subfamily Sapindoideae. In contrast to the general view of evolution in Sapindaceae pollen, the aperture system of Arytera pollen did not appear to be more conservative than the ornamentation. The evolutionary changes in the aperture system and ornamentation do not ‘coincide’, which suggests them to be functionally relatively independent.

N2  - This should be the start of a really great enterprise: A cyclopedia of the woody plants of the world. This first installment includes, apart from some introductory chapters, the full treatment of about 40 species. On an average each species gets some eight pages of text, including a short general introduction, a fairly extensive description in which special attention is paid to wood, bark, rooting, flowers, fruits, and seeds; the seedling is often represented by a clear drawing; further are given notes on distribution, dispersal, ecology, culture, diseases, and uses. The text is illustrated with several often fine colour photographs depicting habit, bark, sometimes wood, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds, some drawings, and a map of the area of distribution. Finally, the species is concluded by some general notes and by a list of additional literature. The text is well-printed on glossy, heavy, apparently strong paper. And strong it should be as the work is bound in a ring binder which makes it easy to add species, to replace sheets, and to arrange them your own way, but which on the other hand easily may wear out in such a probably frequently used work.The obvious first question regards the limitation: ‘der Holzgewächse’ means ‘of all the woody plants’; this seems rather much. The index mentions three groups, viz. trees from the Tropics and Subtropics, from the Temperate climate zones, and shrubs and subshrubs from Central Europe. Apart from the latter this is hardly a restriction. Only the word ‘Dendrologie’ in the subtitle and the fact that the majority of the many authors (as mentioned in the prospectus) are connected with forestry may point to economic importance as the main selection criterion. Skimming the species from this first installment learned that most are indeed of some use or other, some, however, of very local use only, and some were only formally used. Moreover, the experience of plant taxonomists is that nearly all plants seem to be of some use locally according to the field labels. The more than 20,000 trees mentioned in the ‘Vorwort’ apparently in principle ought to be included all. With the 30 species a year planned we will not live to see it completed!

Four new species from Vietnam and Thailand are described: P. fallax, P. kuznetsovii, P. lanceolatum, and P. latifolium. Distributions of all the species are mapped. Pseudodracontium macrophyllum Gagnep. ex Serebryanyi is validly published here for the first time. Two taxa are reduced to synonymy: P. anomalum N.E. Br. is reduced to P. lacourii; P. flotoi S.Y. Hu is reduced to P. harmandii. Three species (P. kerrii, P. laoticum, and P. siamense) invalidly published by Gagnepain are mentioned under the species to which they actually belong. Ecological and taxonomic notes are provided.

Sinclair (1968) accepted 40 species names with 7 varieties, Foreman (1974, 1978) admitted 45 names (38 species and 8 varieties). In the present census I have 95 species and 31 taxa of infraspecific rank, reflecting a more refined species definition as well as the intensified field collecting of the last decades. A key is given, based on male and female flowering and fruiting specimens.

N2  - The leaf anatomical characters of Harpullia and the related genera Majidea and Conchopetalum are described in detail. Harpullia and Majidea both have stellate hair tufts together with solitary unicellular hairs, in Conchopetalum stellate hair tufts are absent.A high variability below the species level is reported for several leaf epidermal characters. Other leaf anatomical characters such as the hypodermis, sclerification of the bundle sheath extensions, and the presence of secretory idioblasts and idioblastic sclereids also show a considerable variation. Characters with a higher diagnostic value within Harpullia are the type of stomata and in certain species the presence of idioblastic sclereids in the mesophyll.Based on leaf anatomy the subgenus Otonychium within Harpullia can be distinguished by the cyclocytic stomatal type and absence of secretory idioblasts. The subgenus Harpullia is characterized by the paracytic stomatal type, which has not been recorded elsewhere within the Sapindaceae. A subdivision of the subgenus Harpullia cannot be made, because of an obvious lack of mutual correlation between the different leaf anatomical characters.

N2  - It is not the custom to review publications not directly pertaining to the Malesian flora. However, as most of the lowland species of grasses have a wide distribution from Africa through India to Malesia and beyond, the value is surpassing the geographical limits of this flora. Firstly, the present work is a thorough updating of a previous treatment of the grasses for Sri Lanka by Seneratna, ‘Grasses of Ceylon’ (1956). Secondly, by having descriptions, it is a useful companion to Bor’s ‘Grasses of Burma, Ceylon, India and Pakistan’ (1960).It is a compilation of contributions by various authors (W.D. Clayton, G. Davidse, F. Gould, M. Lazarides, T.R. Soderstrom), causing a rather variable ‘flavour and phrasing’ retained as best as possible by the final editor.

N2  - Trigonopleura, a genus from W Malesia, has three species, the widespread T. malayana (Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi) and the two endemic species T. dubia (Philippines) and T. macrocarpa (Sarawak, Kuching). The species differ slightly from each other in leaf size, colour, and margin, flower and fruit size, fruit wall thickness, and aril size.A phylogenetic analysis was not performed, but it is argued that both endemic species split off separately from T. malayana. Trigonopleura is probably related to Chaetocarpus, in particular to C. castanocarpus. Probably, Chaetocarpus is a paraphyletic group of species and will be monophylitic when united with Trigonopleura, but this will need thorough phylogenetic research. Here, both genera are kept separate, because they are very distinct (see Table 1).Typical for Trigonopleura are the fruits (wrinkled when dry, tomentose), the seeds (arillate), the inflorescences (axillary clusters of flowers), and the flowers (sepals imbricate, petals present, valvate, disc lobed, an androphore, 3 locules with one ovule each).

N2  - The Erismantheae (monoecious, leaves opposite, stipules interpetiolar) contain three genera, Moultonianthus (monotypic), and Erismanthus and Syndyophyllum, each with 2 species. Moultonianthus is recognized by its persistent, large, cordate stipules; Erismanthus is characterized by the catkin-like staminate inflorescences with very long-pedicelled flowers; and characteristic for Syndyophyllum are the inflorescences with both staminate flowers (in bundles) and pistillate flowers (one per bundle of staminate flowers). Both varieties of Syndyophyllum occidentale are now considered to be distinctive species, because an additional difference was found (one axillary bud of each leaf pair present halfway along the petiole or not).The phylogenetic analysis of the Erismantheae, in comparison with two other tribes in the subfamily Acalyphoideae, the Chaetocarpeae and the Cheiloseae, shows that the Erismantheae are a very distinct, monophyletic group. Within the Erismantheae, Erismanthus and Syndyophyllum are closest related; all three genera are monophyletic.

N2  - Among the treasures of the Komarov Botanical Institute at St. Petersburg is a folio known as “Thunberg Icones Plantarum Japonicarem (ineditae)”. This volume contains 305 fine drawings, washed grey apart from a few that are in watercolours. Actually, known can hardly be said; like so many bound collections of pictures only a few of the institutions’ staff members with a special interest in history know of its existence, still less have ever seen it. Good photographs of these drawings (natural size, that is 37 x 26 cm) form the kernel of this work.Added are Maxomiwicz’s notes on the drawings (the great Russian 19th century botanist Maximowicz with his special interest in the East Asian flora brought some important historical collections on Japanese botany to the herbarium of St. Petersburg, including also the present volume); photographs of those plants from Thunberg’s herbarium – now in Uppsala – which were clearly the models of many of the drawings; some chapters on the history of Japanese botany and especially on the role played by Thunberg and by Maximowicz. Added also is an Appendix dedicated to the five fascicles published under the title of “Icones Plantarum Japonicarum”. This gives facsimiles of 50 prints, like the ‘ineditae’ accompanied by critical remarks and photographs of the corresponding herbarium specimens if any. Finally, some extensive indexes make the entrance to this work easy.

N2  - Three years after publication of volume 2, which was entirely devoted to Bulbophyllum (by J.J. Vermeulen), volume 1 of what should become a complete iconography of the Orchids of Borneo has appeared. Each volume is projected to contain a hundred species, which means that eventually fifteen volumes will line up on our shelves. If the pace of production is not increased, most of us will be retired or dead by then. I really hope to live to see the completion of this series, because it is magnificent! It invites comparison with the legendary series ‘Venezuelan Orchids Illustrated’ by Dunsterville  Garay, both in format and in the quality of the illustrations. The text is much better, however, giving not only descriptions, but also elaborate notes on habitat and ecology, distribution, etymology and miscellaneous topics.This first volume starts with general chapters in which, apart from the inevitable introduction to the orchid family, a useful survey is given of the various habitats in Borneo with their characteristic orchid species. It is a pity that there are no illustrations of at least some of these habitats here, but one can find several in volume 2. No reference is made to them in the present volume, however.

N2  - South Africa has a rich, but scantily surveyed, desert flora. Documenting annual and geophytic species in this biome is challenging, as they usually only flower after adequate precipitation, which is characteristically erratic and infrequent. Recent floristic surveys in the Ai-Ais / Richtersveld Transfrontier Park were conducted after abnormally high precipitation and revealed the presence of numerous potentially new plant taxa, including two new members of the genus Oxalis. These taxa are clearly morphologically distinct from any known species. Here we explore the relationships of these species to other southern African species based on analyses of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and trnS-trnG DNA sequence data. Molecular data and morphological comparisons show that these collections represent new species closely allied to Oxalis pes-caprae, O. compressa, O. copiosa and O. haedulipes. Accordingly we describe them here as O. petricola and O. rubricallosa. Oxalis petricola is known from one isolated population of fewer than 500 individuals and is probably of special conservation concern. Oxalis rubricallosa is known from two small populations. The belated discovery of a large and showy species such as O. rubricallosa highlights the urgent need for more extensive floristic surveys of southern African desert regions.

A key, based on both flower and fruit characteristics, gives access to the species. The study was restricted to the macromorphological characters, leading to a data matrix with 25 characters. The cladistic analysis was run with the computerprogram HENNIG86. Eventually one cladogram has been accepted.

Twelve contributions demonstrate the importance of the tapetum in the reproduction of land plants. As the editors state: any tapetum malfunction causes pollen sterility. All papers deal with basic research, not with applied research such as plant breeding and genetic engineering.Although ‘evolution’ is listed in the title, very little (no special contribution) is devoted to this subject. It is a pity, because a phylogenetic theory has been suggested in the past, which should be treated in a book covering such a highly and diversely specialised structure. A taxonomic survey (table) listing the various tapetum types in different groups of land plants, and a section on the ‘14 functions’ attributed to the tapetum, and referred to on several occasions in the book, would be very convenient, and might stimulate own thougths on the evolutionary significance of diverging tapetum function and possible evolution scenarios. The first paper, on the role of the tapetum in pollen and spore dispersal, is very interesting in this context, but somewhat fuzzy and suffering from an unsatisfying table 1.

N2  - A critical study of the nongeniculate Corallinaceae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) from the Spermonde Archipelago, Southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia, has been carried out. More than 750 collections, including type- and other relevant collections, were examined. In total 16 taxa belonging to 7 genera of nongeniculate Corallinaceae are reported. These are Lithophyllum (4 species), Hydrolithon (3 species), Mastophora (2 species), Neogoniolithon (1 species), Spongites (2 species), Lithothamnion (1 species), and Mesophyllum (3 species). The synonymy, type collection(s), type locality (ies), specimens examined, a detailed description, and remarks are given for each taxon. Two collections are referred to an unidentified taxon, probably belonging to the genus Spongites.

N2  - In this volume the author concentrates on the comparative study of tropical flowers. He gives a practical approach (see Introduction, page 3) to recognize tropical flowers at three levels: a) Organization (‘Bauplan’), with emphasis on history and macroevolution (see Chapter 2); b) Construction (‘Gestalt’), i.e. architecture (see Chapter 3); and c) Mode, with emphasis on ecology and microevolution (see Chapters 4  5). Its scope is the understanding or biological interpretation of characters and character variation of flowers for the phylogenetic reconstruction of the angiosperms at these levels. The author claims that knowledge of the phylogenetic history and of the interactions between animals and plants may be of vital importance for the evaluation of conservation actions and that the modem threats to biodiversity urges more and better knowledge of the biology of flowers in the widest sense.In Chapters 2-7 an enormous number of facts about flowers have been brought together, most from literature but also from original sources, providing a unique insight into the (reproductive) morphology, biology and evolution of flowers, as much as possible indicating the major presumed evolutionary trends.

N2  - Clerodendrum fistulosum Becc. is a true myrmecophyte as it offers nesting space for ants in hollow internodes. In contrast to previous reports our investigations proved that these domatia open by themselves, thus providing cavities for a variety of different ant species. In Sarawak, Malaysia, we did not find an obligate relationship between C. fistulosum and a specific ant-partner. For comparison, studies on herbarium material of other Clerodendrum species were carried out: a further species, C. deflexum from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra presumably also is myrmecophytic.

Schltr., but with relatively much shorter, elliptic petals and broadly rounded side-lobes to the lip. More than half a dozen collections of C. citrina were studied, including the types of Dendrobium fluctuosum and D. citrinum. They are quite constant morphologically, differing only somewhat in the size of the flowers. The description of Dendrobium citrinum is of a relatively small-flowered specimen, that of D. fluctuosum of a large-flowered one. Most of the specimens seen by me were intermediate in size. This very pretty species is widely distributed in New Guinea, from the Cenderawasih [Vogelkop] Peninsula in Irian Jaya to the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea, between 1100 and 2000 m asl.Cadetia doormanii (J.J.

N2  - The first edition of this work appeared in a single volume in 1969. Now, about a quarter of a century later, so many additional species had to be included, that two volumes are needed. Most of the additions are new species described since 1969, partly as a result of the splitting tendencies of some recent Australian botanists, of which Dockrill is highly critical. Each species is described in detail and illustrated with a full-page line drawing. While perhaps not of professional quality, the drawings are sufficiently clear and accurate to make the task of identifying almost any tropical Australian orchid a light one. In addition, all genera and species are keyed out.The distribution within Australia is usually given in considerable detail, but for those without an encyclopedic knowledge of Australian topography it is often difficult to get an idea of the area concerned. A few maps, and some degree of standardization would have been helpful.

N2  - Six species are recognized in Neoscortechinia, two more than before, because N. angustifolia is raised to species level and N. forbesii is split into N. philippinensis (new combination) and N. forbesii s.s. The varieties of N. kingii are united. The genus Cheilosa, which closely resembles Neoscortechinia, is kept separate and it is used as the outgroup in the cladistic analysis of Neoscortechinia. The latter analysis resulted into a cladogram, which shows a first branching off of the sister species N. angustifolia and N. sumatrensis, followed by a subsequent branching off of N. nicobarica, N. philippinensis, and finally N. forbesii and N. kingii. Four of the six species show a wide-spread distribution in W Malesia ( N. kingii, N. nicobarica, N. philippinensis, and N. sumatrensis) and N. forbesii is wide-spread in E Malesia. Only N. angustifolia has an endemic distribution (NE Borneo) and is vicariant with its sister species. The distribution of N. forbesii may be due to dispersal combined with a vicariance event.

N2  - Recent literature is controversial as regards the segregation of Hallea and Mitragyna, and pretends that the two genera show pollen morphological differences. In the present study the pollen morphology of all ten species of the complex is described on the basis of light and scanning electron microscopy (including examination of broken grains, which were obtained with a technique never applied in palynology, viz. shaking with glass beads).The two genera have 3-zonocolporate grains with compound apertures (endoapertures are always H-shaped, sometimes incompletely so). While Hallea showed to be stenopalynous (sexine always tectate-perforate), Mitragyna is more variable (sexine microreticulate or tectate-perforate), and several of its species have pollen similar to that of Hallea.Numerical analysis was used to evaluate the palynological observations in the light of the macromorphological variation in the complex. It is concluded that both Hallea and Mitragyna deserve generic recognition, but are not fully distinct pollen morphologically.

N2  - This book is essentially a much expanded and updated version of Dressier’s well known ‘The Orchids; natural history and classification’ (1981), without the parts on natural history.Dressier divides the orchid family in five subfamilies: Apostasioideae, Cypripedioideae, Epidendroideae, Spiranthoideae, Orchidoideae. The Epidendroideae have swallowed the Vandoideae, which he recognized in his earlier book. At the tribal and subtribal level there are many changes too. Most of these changes reflect increased knowledge and the results of in-dept studies, and are therefore likely to be improvements. The classification proposed is the most thorough and best-argued one currently available. Much is still tentative, however, and even the number of subfamilies and their circumscription can by no means be considered definitive. Dressler is an open-minded scientist, who never hides his doubts and uncertainties about his own system. He would be the first to point out weak spots in his scheme. In the same spirit I should like to offer some comments and criticisms.

N2  - The Indo-Malesian genus Walsura Roxb. is revised and the closely related new genus, Pseudoclausena, is segregated from it. Walsura consists of three sections of which one ( Ruswala) is newly described, and thirteen species of which three (W. dehiscens, W. pachycaulon and W. sarawakensis) are newly described. One new combination is made (W. trifoliolata subsp. acuminata). The Malesian genus Pseudoclausena consists of one species (P. chrysogyne), formerly Walsura chrysogyne, and W. velutina is reduced to a new forma of it. A summary of the taxonomic history of the species is given. Notes on morphology (including micro-features of the leaf surface and pollen), wood, fruit and seed anatomy and chromosome and chemotaxonomic studies are included and seed dispersal systems are considered. Variation within the genera and speciation and biogeography are discussed. Notes on economic botany are given. All species are described and a key is presented.

Acrocarpus is so far known with only one species, A. fraxinifolius. Afzelia has two widely distributed, variable species both occurring in Malesia: A. javanica and A. rhomboidea. Pseudosindora has been reduced to Copaifera, which consists of 20-30 species mostly occurring in tropical America and Africa. One interesting species, C. palustris, is found in Malesia. Intsia consists of two or more species. In Malesia there are two widely distributed, very variable, difficult species, I. bijuga and I. palembanica. Information on their regeneration and uses have been reviewed.

N2  - A new account of the genus Myristica Gronov. in the Pacific area, here defined as comprising the Carolines, the Solomon Islands including Bougainville, and the islands further towards the East, up to Fiji and Samoa. There are 16 species and eight infraspecific taxa, most locally endemic. Three species, one subspecies, and two forms are described as new; five new subspecific combinations are proposed. Only one key to the species is given, to be used for male flowering as well as for female flowering or fruiting material. The key is primarily based on vegetative characters. Besides the typical appearance of the fruit, also the exact nature of the inflorescences ranks among the major characters for the distinction of species. Fruits are illustrated to enhance the quick recognition of the species. The newly proposed taxa are: Myristica guadalcanalensis, M. xylocarpa, M. acsmithii, M. kajewskii subsp. robusta and M. inutilis subsp. platyphylla forma mesophylla and forma nanophylla; new combinations are: M. inutilis subsp. platyphylla, M. inutilus subsp. platyphylla forma procera, M. globosa subsp. chalmersii and subsp. muelleri, and M. hypargyraea subsp. insularis.

N2  - The concepts of prophyll and calyculus in Santalales are reviewed, and are found to be of variable taxonomic importance in different families. The calyculus in Loranthaceae has been generally interpreted as a reduced calyx, a concept recently challenged by Wanntorp  Ronse De Craene (2009), who concluded that it represents a fusion of prophylls. This view, as well as the accompanying biseriate corolla notion, is rejected. In Loranthaceae, prophylls associated with flowers have sometimes provided significant taxonomic features, while in Viscaceae this is true mostly in the vegetative portions of plants, especially in Arceuthobium, Dendrophthora and Phoradendron.

N2  - This book summarizes in a rather popular way scattered information on the problem of conservation of plant diversity. Ordered to the eight major regions of the world, a rather arbitrary selection of about 2000 rare and endangered species are described, some 250 also illustrated, partly in colour.The commission on endangered plant species under the IUCN has estimated that c. 20,000 species of higher plants need protection, whereas they include only 250 species in the Red data book of plants. This illustrates the very much incomplete knowledge of the current conservation status of plant species. Therefore, any attempt to summarize the present state of knowledge is unavoidably rather erratic.

N2  - In 1985 during the Fourth Expedition to S Aceh, Sumatra, in the neighbourhood of the G. Leuser National Park a representative of Sarcotheca (Oxalidaceae) was collected. It clearly is a member of the S. laxa complex previously known only from Malaya and the Riouw Archipelago. It differs from all by the golden puberulous, soon glabrescent innovations, the thicker, broader, more ovate leaflets, and the structure of the inflorescences (short, slender, subequally branched). In the technical characters it seems closest to var. sericea (Ridley) Veldk., but it differs by the leafblades with fewer pairs of nerves, the sparsely white puberulous inflorescence axes and branches (the hairs can easily be distinguished separately and seem longer), the pedicels with the lower part distinctly much longer than the upper, the rounded petals, and the apparently larger fruits.It does not seem to be identical with the collection from the Riouw Archipelago mentioned earlier [Veldkamp, Blumea 15 (1967) 533; Fl. Males. I, 7 (1971) 171], which has the typical long and narrow leaves of the other varieties of S. laxa, although also rather coriaceous. The infructescence seems similar, but the sepals in fruit are hairy mainly in the midline and not regularly all over as in var. brigittae. Another collection from the same area is De Wilde  De Wilde-Duyfjes 20674 (L).

N2  - This review marks the appearance of Volume II, after the publication of Volume I, Pteridophytes and Gymnosperms, in 1990; several more volumes are expected in the future before completion of the Vascular plants as a whole.The present volume contains 73 families out of some 250-500 families which can be recognized within the Angiosperms, depending on the taxonomic concepts applied. The 73 families represent three major blocks of comparatively ‘primitive’ dicotyledons: Magnoliid, Hamamelid, and Centrospermous families. The families are treated in an alphabetical order, with among the larger families Aizoaceae (127 genera, with c. 2500 species), Annonaceae (128 genera, with c. 2300 species), Amaranthaceae, Cactaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Lauraceae, Ranunculaceae, and Urticaceae. Each family treatment consists of a family description, and key(s) to the genera, with descriptions, and concise summaries of the modern state of knowledge of: Characters of rare occurrence, Vegetative morphology, Anatomy, Inflorescences, Flower morphology, Embryology, Pollen morphology, Pollination, Fruit and Seed, Dispersal, Phytochemistry, Subdivision and relations within the family and Affinities (to other families), Distribution and Habitats, Economic importance or other miscellaneous uses, and Paleobotany. Often divisions into subfamilies, tribes, ‘groups’, or (for the genera) into sections are dealt with. Illustrations are schemes, line-drawings of plants (with habits and details), photographs of pollen, and microphotographs of plants growing in situ or in their habitat.

N2  - Secondary pollen presentation is a taxonomically widespread phenomenon that is unknown to many botanists. As defined by the author, it embraces those cases in which pollen is transferred within the flower, and presented to pollinators on or by floral structures other than the thecae. The intraflower transfer often involves intriguing adaptations of petals, androecium and distal parts of the gynoecium.The present book is largely a case of secondary presentation itself, being actually a review of the literature on the subject, supplemented with unpublished data and drawings. The main part (208 pp.) extensively describes familywise all taxa known to have secondary pollen presentation, with many comments inserted. Papaveraceae, Leguminosae, Proteaceae, Campanulaceae, Goodeniaceae and Rubiaceae provide relatively many examples, whereas secondary presentation is general in Compositae. A discussion and separate list of references conclude each family. Although the descriptions are very detailed and many cases nicely illustrated, usually with drawings from the source publications, it is sometimes hard to imagine the structures and mechanisms. It would facilitate understanding if more symbols had been used in the drawings.

N2  - Pollen of 30 species and 12 hybrids (88 samples in total) of Hawaiian Cyrtandra, covering all 6 sections recognized on the Hawaiian archipelago, was examined using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Hawaiian Cyrtandra is stenopalynous. The pollen grains are binucleate, isopolar, small-sized and 3-colporoidate (very rarely 4-colporoidate). In equatorial view they are spheroidal, in polar view circular or semiangular. The tectum is mostly microreticulate with brochi of different sizes (heterobrochate), very rarely reticulate or perforate. Supratectal elements are lacking. Some variation can be observed in number and diameter of the lumina. Palynological features of most of the investigated taxa tend to overlap and thus are not very helpful in supporting the infrageneric division of Cyrtandra on Hawaii.Pollen viability of hybrids, which is said to be reduced occasionally, was examined and found to be high with rates of 70 to 99%. Therefore, reduced pollen viability is not a reliable character for designating hybrid status.Asian Cyrtandra is eurypalynous. For this study, 19 species, originating from the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, have been investigated. Two exine types, differing in sculpture and structure, can be distinguished: 1) tectum microreticulate-reticulate, supratectal elements lacking, and 2) tectum microreticulate-perforate with numerous conical supratectal elements. The number, diameter and shape of lumina provide further important diagnostic features.

N2  - The kernel of this book consists of an enumeration of some 1600 publications of importance to the flora of the Mascarenes (East of Madagascar; main islands Réunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues), arranged alphabetically by author. Fairly often a short note is given on contents and importance. Counterpart to this enumeration is an extensive Subject Index which gives many different entries to the first part.The practical value of a book like the present one depends primarily on its completeness, secondarily on its selectivity. As to the first point, this is not easy to check. Comparison with the literature on some families the reviewer is acquainted with gave the impression that the enumeration is still (rather?) incomplete. Therefore, we may hope that future, ever more complete editions may follow. As to the second point, the inclusion of some obvious worldwide handbooks (Index Kewensis, Taxonomic Literature, Jackson’s Glossary of botanic terms, just to mention a few) seems of doubtful value, though other people may be of a different opinion.

N2  - Eleven seagrass species were found in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Seagrasses occurred in five different habitats, i.e. intertidal terrigenous mudflats, shallow terrigenous sandy bays, coastal reef flats, reef flats of patch reefs, and sandy reef bases, from the intertidal to a maximum depth of 35 m. Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were the dominant constant species of stable environments (permanently present in climax vegetations). Cymodocea rotundata, Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis were the dominant pioneering species in the area. A considerable number (117) of macroalgal taxa were found associated with seagrass vegetation, but only 13 of these were found exclusively in association with seagrasses. Macroalgal biomass in the seagrass beds was usually low (lt; 5 g AFDW m-2). However, in stressed habitats macroalgae may contribute up to 50% to the total biomass, notably during periods of occasional blooming. Species diversity of seagrasses and associated macroalgae was much lower in stressed habitats, which are characterized by heavy sedimentation, physical instability of the substratum, or high turbidity.

N2  - The Australasian/Malesian group of genera Amylotheca, Cyne, Decaisnina, Lampas, Lepeostegeres and Loxanthera is reviewed. Particular attention is given to the species of the Malesian region, as a precursor to a treatment of Loranthaceae for Flora Malesiana. The genera are part of a floristic element of Gondwanan derivation which has diversified in the southeast Asian and western Malesian region, and has reached the Papuasian/Australasian region from the west following the establishment of Charles’s Line. The six genera comprise 46 species ( Amylotheca 4, Cyne 6, Decaisnina 25, Lampas 1, Lepeostegeres 9, Loxanthera 1). Along with the Australian genus Lysiana (8 species) they form a natural group with tribal or subtribal status. Major centres of species richness are in Borneo, the Philippines, and New Guinea.Revised genus and species circumscriptions necessitate a number of nomenclatural changes to earlier regional treatments. Three species are described as new, viz., Cyne baetorta, C. monotrias and Decaisnina longipes. There are 15 new combinations, viz., Cyne papuana, C. perfoliata, Decaisnina aherniana, D. amplexicaulis, D. angustata, D. celebica, D. confertiflora, D. crassilimba, D. cumingii, D. miniata, D. ovatifolia, D. revoluta, D. sumbawensis, D. viridis, and D. zollingeri.

It is interesting, not only because it is distinctive, but because it is the only Malesian Olea which grows on ultrabasic soil and, as it has been collected only from forest on this soil type, it suggests that it may be confined to it.

N2  - With over 80 original publications on foliar sclereids, published in the last 30 years, Dr. T. Ananda Rao is a well qualified author for a compendium on the subject. The book consists of a general and a special part. The former includes a historical and methodological introduction, a major chapter on the morphological classification of the various types of sclereids and tracheoids and their distribution patterns, and sections on their taxonomic significance as well as their ontogeny and (presumed) functions. The special part is an ‘abstract review’ of literature records and original observations on 121 families of angiosperms, arranged according to the Takhtajan system. The book is richly illustrated with line drawings as well as numerous halftone plates.Especially the review by family makes this book a useful source of reference. I could not help being somewhat disappointed by the first chapters, in which the various types are defined and classified. A comparison of the illustrations and the fairly vague definitions in the text soon make it impossible for the reader to see the distinctions between, for instance, several of the 5 main types and 9 subtypes of the socalled polymorphic sclereids (all astrosclereids in the good old terminology of Tschirch, 1889). The author would have done us a real service if in a series of drawings the permitted variation range and defining characteristics of each type would have been unambiguously illustrated. Now the subtle differences between trichosclereids, zosterosclereids, and ophiuro-sclereids as illustrated in plate 3.3 and defined on pp. 10-12 will elude most. With full respect for the view that some more terms are needed than the mere four which Tschirch introduced in his classification, I feel that Rao has gone too far to the other extreme by recognizing most types, at one time or another introduced by zealous authors who wished to make their mark on anatomical history by introducing a superfluous name for a sclereid type. The author himself is perhaps not entirely without blame: his ‘gnarliform sclereids’, elevated to the superrank of the sole ‘cacomorphic type’ seems to me as well described as “an astrosclereid with irregularly curved or curly branches.” Do we need new terms for each aberrant type? In this respect I feel that an opportunity has been missed to clean up the confusing terminology in the literature even further by a really unambiguous and concise classification of types (of course with full recognition of intermediate forms). Another criticism is aimed at the publisher as much as the author: the number of uncorrected major printing errors exceeds all acceptable levels, and even makes reading of the general chapters difficult and irritating.

Cheilosa montana combines the two former species C. montana and C. malayana (Hook. f.) Airy Shaw. Typical for Cheilosa are the presence of glands in the teeth of the leaves; thyrsoid, mainly unbranched, ramiflorous to terminal inflorescences; absence of petals; the presence of a disc; 9 or 10 stamens; 3- (rarely 4)-locular ovaries with one ovule per locule; thick-walled fruits; an aril around the seed; and endosperm. Fascicled hairs are usually present on the lower surface of the leaves, but are caducous. The excluded C. whiteana Croizat is provisionally transferred as a new species to Trigonostemon by Airy Shaw.

N2  - Cladistic analyses of pollen-morphological, leaf-anatomical and macromorphological data of Jagera, Trigonachras, and several new species lead to the conclusion that a new genus, Cnesmocarpon, has to be described (see the Taxonomic Part on p. 195).Two pollen types are described, one including Cnesmocarpon, the other including Jagera and Trigonachras. The morphologies of these pollen types suggest different harmomegathic systems: nonapertural and apertural folding respectively. The ornamentation of Cnesmocarpon pollen resembles that of several other Cupanieae genera. The scabrate ornamentation of Jagera and Trigonachras pollen, often provided with hair-like appendages, is unique in that tribe.Leaf-anatomically Jagera is characterised by the presence of glands with a multicellular head and by the absence of papillae. Cnesmocarpon is characterised by the presence of papillae (one species has glands with a unicellular head). Trigonachras is characterised by the absence of both papillae and glands.Macromorphologically Jagera and Cnesmocarpon share the irritating hairs on the fruit. Jagera and Trigonachras share the character of lower surface of leaflets with ‘naked glands’.The phylogenetic analysis of the complete data set shows Jagera and Trigonachras as more closely related to each other than to Cnesmocarpon.

N2  - The title of this volume is a bit misleading. Apart from Rosaceae also the Chrysobalanaceae (two autochthonous species) and the Neuradaceae (one species) are treated. The bulk, however, concerns the Rosaceae in the more restricted and generally adapted sense. In India 32 genera of this family, comprising some 450 species, are autochthonous. Nine genera are treated in this volume, four ( Aruncus, Neillia, Sorbaria, and Spiraea) belonging to the subfamily Spiraeoideae and five ( Agrimonia, Alchemilla, Filipendula, Geum, and Sanguisorba) to the Rosoideae. Most of the genera have only few species (1 to 6) in India but Spiraea has 31 and Alchemilla has 26. The second part of the series is now in production and will contain studies on Rosa, some Maloideae and Prunus of the Amygdaloideae.The treatment is largely based on Purohit’s unpublished doctor’s thesis written under the direction and on instignation of the second author. These regional revisions summarize a large amount of information not only on morphology but also on distribution, anatomy, karyology, ecology, chemistry (and some little on uses). In several places theoretical taxonomy is amply considered too, among others in the chapter on “principles for recognition of taxonomic categories in relation to the Rosales”, but also in the introduction to the revision of Alchemilla where the concept of microspecies is elaborated. There are also special discussion paragraphs on distribution patterns, endemism, and on evolutionary trends in the family as far as India is concerned.

N2  - The recent surge of interest in plants growing over serpentine is reflected in a spate of papers on the subject, so much so that it is difficult to keep track of what has been published. The present volume is an attempt in that direction. Both editors can glory in a long career of research on serpentine plants.The term serpentine is often used to denote a wide range of ultramafic rocks which are characterized by high concentrations of toxic heavy metals (Cr, Co, Ni), high Fe and Mg and low Ca and Si concentrations. The vegetation growing on serpentine often shows a striking contrast with surrounding vegetations on different soils. The stature is mostly low, xeromorphic structures prevail and floristic diversity is usually low, although endemism may be quite high.

N2  - As almost half of the Malesian species of Meliaceae are found in the genus Aglaia, we are glad to receive a sound monograph published for this ecologically so important genus. The format can be characterized as ‘classical’, with chapters on taxonomic history, morphology, floral biology and pollination, fruit and seed-dispersal, germination, cytology, variation and distribution, besides the pure taxonomic revision. The first part would have been a little more attractive for the reader if certain characters had been drawn, especially some of the very intricate or minute features as scales and stellate hairs which have been used intensively in the key and for which, unfortunately, every botanist seems to have his own definition.The 105 species are described in great detail, including lengthy citations of representative specimens. An identification list at the end of the volume seems much more helpful for the users, especially curators of herbaria, and would have reduced the number of pages drastically without loss of important information. But what is really a little bit annoying is the key to the species. First of all the key is very difficult to read and especially to find the corresponding leads due to the chosen lay-out. Of course, it is obvious that it is an immense work to construct a key to 105 species that is userfriendly, but there are solutions which serve the reader much better, i.e., to give separate keys to the species of at least some of the phytogeographical entities. The bigger islands or island groups and the Asian mainland certainly deserve their own keys to facilitate the identification process.

N2  - On 2 September 1992 Rob Geesink died a week before he would have reached the age of 47. He had been associated with the Rijksherbarium from his student days in the sixties onwards. For his MSc programme he successfully revised the Portulacaceae for Flora Malesiana and carried out an experimental-ecological study of the genus Bangia (red algae). In 1971 he received his congratulatory (‘cum laude’) MSc degree. From 1972 to 1974 he was executive taxonomist in the Thai-Dutch cooperative project for the Flora of Thailand, a post during which he made four botanical explorations. In 1976 he was finally appointed on the staff of the Rijksherbarium, from 1987 to early 1990 as Project Leader of the research group for Tropical Phanerogams.Rob’s talents and interests covered a unique and broad range; from handy-man to theorist, and from efficiency improvement in the daily routine of plant collecting and taxonomy to the application of information theory in evolution. As a student he impressed his supervisors Van Steenis and Den Hartog, when he developed a device to shake and aerate algal cultures with the aid of spare motorcycle parts. Later ‘inventions’ included the use of a bottle cap in combination with an electric cigarette lighter to boil and rehydrate delicate herbarium fragments, a noise-reducing exhaust for engines, and a do-it-yourself altimeter for trees. His eye for the practical is also apparent from the enthusiasm with which he took the initiative to produce, together with other colleagues, a fully revised version of Thonner’s ‘Key to the Families of Flowering Plants’, from the production of a punched card key to the genera of SE Asian Leguminosae, and from his analysis of practical changes needed to ever complete Flora Malesiana. During his PhD study, initially aimed at a revision of the genus Millettia, but later modified to a generic treatment of the tribe Millettieae (‘Scala Millettiearum’, published in 1984), Rob had felt a strong need for a more thorough knowledge of theoretical aspects of systematics, especially of phylogenetics. Insights developed during broad and intensive background reading were shared with students and colleagues through introductory manuals and in regular reading and discussion circles which Rob initiated both in Leiden and Wageningen, and which are continued after his death with a nation-wide attendance. In the last years Rob was especially interested in the newly developed theory of evolution as an entropic process as well as in the philosophy of systematic science. He must be given credit for introducing modern cladistics and historical biogeography to the Rijksherbarium.

Six aré new to science. Typhonium millarii F.M. Bailey is reduced to synonymy with T. angustilobum F. Muell. Illustrations and distribution maps are provided. Keys are given to the genera of geophytic Aroideae in Australasia and to the species of Typhonium. Apparent affinity between two new Australian Typhonium species and the Indian genus Theriophonum is noted. It is suggested that Australasian representation of Areae is mostly autochthonous and ancient rather than immigrant and comparatively recent in origin.

Comparisons based on available data show that as far as the two recognized sections are concerned, embryological characters are uniform in all aspects, disapproving of the splitting of the genus into two sections. The notable differences between Tripterospermum and closely related genera support the phylogenetic conclusion that Tripterospermum is monophyletic.

N2  - Seaweeds are important components of tropical reef systems. The present paper deals with the Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and noncoralline Rhodophyta collected by the first author in the Spermonde Archipelago, SW Sulawesi, Indonesia, during the Buginesia-III project (November 1988-November 1990). Additional collections from this area by Keblusek (July 1991-October 1991) were also studied and the results are incorporated in the present paper. The results of the present study are compared with those of the Siboga Expedition (1899-1900), of the Danish Expedition to the Kei Islands (1914-1916), and of the Snellius-II Expedition (1985). In total, 199 taxa (80 Chlorophyta belonging to 21 genera, 36 taxa of Phaeophyta belonging to 11 genera, 83 noncoralline Rhodophyta belonging to 40 genera, and about 35 taxa of coralline algae) were collected. Of these, 72 taxa are new records for Indonesia (17 Chlorophyta, 20 Phaeophyta, and 35 noncoralline Rhodophyta). Caulerpa buginense and Udotea flabellum f. longifolia are newly described.Keys to the genera, species, and forms are provided, and remarks on the economic potential of some of the seaweeds are included.

N2  - The Kimberley is an extremely rugged area in NW Australia extending over 170,000 square kilometers. It has always been one of the biologically unknown wilderness areas of the world. The presence of rainforest in this part of the continent was not even known before 1965. In 1986 a three-year exploration was started to unravel its mysteries. The results of this study are laid down in the present volume which deals with a variety of subjects, such as: soil, vegetation, floristics, landsnails, scorpions, spiders, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and nature conservation.The forest is of the monsoon type and consists of a number of patches varying from a clump of a few trees to 100 hectare. In many places these patches are continuous with mangrove or riverine forest. The total area of rainforest is only 0.005 percent of the Kimberley region. According to Malesian standards the flora is relatively poor: 453 species are on record. The fact that all but one (Hibiscus peralbus) of these are wide-spread in tropical Australia, most of them even outside Australia, suggests that this vegetation type is recent.

Of ten of these species sporogenesis was also studied, after the application of conventional fixation techniques for transmission electron microscopy, or of freeze fracturing for scanning electron microscopy. For the species studied here and for those described earlier in this series of publications, the possible value of spore characters in phylogenetic analysis is discussed.

N2  - The Goodeniaceae is a fascinating family, nearly exclusively Australian. It comprises 11 genera with some 400 species. Most of the genera are small to medium; the largest genera are Scaevola with nearly 100 species and Goodenia with 178 Australian species. The closely allied Brunoniaceae is monotypic, strictly Australian.By now the format of this series is well known. To its special attractions belong the fine colour photographs, especially in a family like the present one. Furthermore, it is illustrated with simple but clear habit pen-drawings, drawings and photographs of indumentum types, hairs, and seeds, and for every species a small map with the distribution within Australia. These maps, and the citation of up to five representative specimens per species, are insufficient to give an impression of rarity or commonness. Mention of the number of collections studied would do already.

N2  - The morphology and distribution patterns of oil and mucilage cells in the leaf of 150 species of Cinnamomum are described. Idioblasts are always present in the palisade and the spongy parenchyma. Usually both oil and mucilage cells occur; in some species either oil or mucilage cells are present. Both types of idioblasts possess a suberized wall layer. The idioblasts vary between species in size/ shape, stainability and number. Variations in the distribution pattern can partly be explained by the proposed homology of the oil and mucilage cells.Other leaf anatomical characters are also mentioned, such as lamina and cuticle thickness, bundle sheath extensions, sclerification of the epidermal, the palisade, and the spongy parenchyma cells, number of palisade layers, presence or absence of a hypodermis, the indumentum and papillate abaxial epidermal cells, and the venation pattern.Most species differ from each other in only one or few leaf anatomical characters (including oil and mucilage cells). A great many combinations in character distribution were observed. However, the distribution pattern in approximately one-fifth of all studied species deviated largely from the typical leaf anatomical character distribution pattern occurring in the majority of Cinnamomum species. There was a maximum of seven differing features out of the sixteen features studied. Within this group almost all neotropical Cinnamomum species are included. The latter species lack sclerified epidermal cells and almost all have penninerved instead of the generally occurring triplinerved leaves.Cluster analyses based on all leaf anatomical features studied revealed that the distribution patterns of the oil and mucilage cells play a significant part in the grouping of the species. Therefore oil and mucilage cells possess at least some diagnostic value within the genus Cinnamomum. The systematic significance of oil and mucilage cells at the infrageneric level remains uncertain for lack of a detailed infrageneric classification of Cinnamomum for comparison with the idioblast distribution patterns.

N2  - This volume on leaf venation patterns is too modest in its title. Not only the Combretaceae are treated, but not less than eleven other families: Lecythidaceae, Barringtoniaceae, Foetidiaceae, Napoleonaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Anisophylleaceae, Lythraceae, Sonneratiaceae, Oliniaceae, Punicaceae, and Onagraceae. Thus, together with the earlier volumes on Myrtaceae and Melastomataceae plus Memecylaceae, the present book effectively completes the venadon survey of the order Myrtales in its widest possible circumscription. Lecythidaceae and Rhizophoraceae and their satellites do not fit well into the order. Altogether the leaves of 479 species are described and pictured, resulting in a wealth of welcome descriptive information.Criticisms voiced about the earlier volumes apply equally strongly to the present one: poor editing and very high numbers of printing errors (especially disturbing in a number of generic names), and more seriously lack of synthesis and discussion of what the diversity in venation patterns described actually means for the classification of the families and genera. For instance, questions like – does Strephonema stand apart in the Combretaceae? – is the much debated separation of the Anisophylleaceae from the Rhizophoraceae supported by divergent venation patterns? – etc., are hardly or not addressed. However, the grouping of species at the end of the book is most interesting. It shows wide ranges of variation in certain genera (e.g. Terminalia, which has species in 9 very different venation pattern groups) and very unexpected combinations of families within some of the venation groups. One consequently wonders about the systematic value of venation patterns and about the way venation patterns are classified by the author.

N2  - The wood anatomy of the Rosaceae is surveyed and analysed, based on the study of 280 species (c. 500 specimens) belonging to 62 genera from different parts of the world. Eighteen wood anatomical characters have been used for a phenetic and phylogenetic classification. In the phenetic classification, 12 groups are recognised and compared with Hutchinson’s tribes. Groups I-V accommodate a mixture of representatives from Spiraeoideae and Rosoideae genera (or tribes); Groups VI-VII comprise the Maloideae plus Cercocarpus; Groups VIII-IX are composed mainly of the tribe Quillajeae, but include Prinsepia, and exclude Exochorda; Groups X-XII represent the Prunoideae. All woody tribes recognised by Hutchinson encompass few closely similar wood anatomical groups except the Cercocarpeae. The Quillajeae, characterised by presumably primitive macromorphological characters, appear to be quite derived wood anatomically, and, according to the phylogenetic analysis, should be included in the Prunoideae or be recognised as a separate subfamily close to the Prunoideae. The wood anatomical variation patterns support a broad generic delimitation in the Maloideae, and a narrow one in the Prunoideae. The wood anatomical evidence also suggests that Cercocarpus be moved to the Maloideae, and that Sorbaria is the most derived representative in the Spiraeoideae/ Rosoideae. Prinsepia, although distinct in its wood anatomy from the Prunus alliance, still forms part of a monophyletic group together with the latter. Based on wood anatomical evidence, the subdivision of the family and the origin of the Maloideae are discussed.Wood anatomically the Rosaceae are isolated within the order Rosales. It is hypothesised that the Rosaceae might have originated in East Asia instead of in the tropics.Individual generic descriptions, a family description and a tentative wood anatomical key to the genera studied are also presented.

N2  - The leaf anatomy of the Melastomataceae, Memecylaceae and Crypteroniaceae is surveyed on the basis of 179 samples representing 151 genera. The Melastomataceae appear to be leaf anatomically very heterogeneous. An unusual diversity of hair types is present, varying from simple unicellular hairs to very complex multicellular, non-glandular or glandular trichomes. Elongate multiseriate unbranched non-glandular hairs and short-stalked glandular hairs are most common. Stomata generally are polo-, dia-, tetra-, and anomocytic; other types and intermediate kinds also occur. A hypodermis is sometimes present. The mesophyll is usually dorsiventral, rarely isobilateral. Sclereids of various types are present in some genera. Crystals are usually druses, sometimes styloids. The vascular bundles in midrib and petiole are almost always bicollateral and only in some genera enclosed by sclerenchyma. The petiole contains an arc composed of widely spaced vascular bundles, sometimes accompanied by accessory bundles. The Memecylaceae are leaf anatomically rather homogeneous in the absence of multicellular hairs, mainly paracytic stomata, a simple vascularisation pattern, and xylem with alternating layers of tracheary elements in the midrib and petiole. The Crypteroniaceae are leaf anatomically characterized by the absence of hairs, mainly paracytic stomata, druses and styloids, and a complex vascular pattern.Leaf anatomy is used to discuss the (sub)families and tribal delimitation of the Melastomataceae alliance and modifications suggested by Van Vliet (1981) (subfamily Crypteronioideae) and Renner (1989a, c and 1992 in press and pers. communication). Leaf anatomy can support a family status of the Crypteroniaceae and also of the Memecylaceae. Within the Melastomataceae the Astronioideae (without Pternandra) are leaf anatomically so distinctive that they deserve a subfamily status. The phylogenetic affinities of Pternandra, which phenetically show an intermediate position between Astronioideae and Memecylaceae, remain at this stage unresolved. The Melastomatoideae are leaf anatomically very diverse and this heterogeneity does not lend support to the traditional classification into 12 tribes nor to alternative tribal classifications.

N2  - In the first sentence of the Preface the elusive concept of ethnobotany is defined in a rather restricted way: “the study of the use of plants by indigenous people”, ‘indigenous’ obviously meaning non-Western and not technologically advanced. Most of the chapters in this book (or rather: the papers brought together in this Symposium volume) agree with the definition given: Banack on plants used in making boats and during voyages; Kirch on agricultural systems; Abbot on uses of seaweeds; Cox on medicinal plants; Lebot on the use of Piper methysticum; Ragone on Artocarpus altilis. These chapters contain interesting stuff, as well from the anthropological as from the botanical point of view. Most of them are also well-written. I found especially the chapter by Lebot a very readable assemblage of botany (including phytochemistry) and anthropology.Two of the chapters, however, do not follow the definition, since they do not stress the uses but the plants. This is not intended as a critique on the inclusion of the chapters, but as a critique on the definition which would make ethnobotany part of anthropology (a part for the study of which botanical knowledge is essential) instead of the interdisciplinary approach as stressed by most ethnobotanists. These chapters belong to the most relevant ones for the botanist.

N2  - On the basis of ontogeny and arrangement of the surrounding cells the stomata in ferns are classified into twenty-four types of which seven – plupolocytic, pseudocopolocytic, sepcopolocytic, pseudohemiparacytic, pluhemiparacytic, pluparacytic and codiacytic – are new. The ontogenetic interrelationships among different stomatal types are traced and the role of stomata in determining the taxonomic position of Psilotum, Tmesipteris and the Ophioglossum group of genera are discussed.It is concluded that the mesogenous and mesoperigenous types of stomata are not distinct entities – one is the derived form of the other. The polocytic stoma which is mesoperigenous in origin is, however, not accepted as the direct descendant of the anomocytic (perigenous) type.

N2  - This symposium volume gives the state of the art in the research on ant-plant interactions. A lot of new data and insights are presented. A thematic grouping of the chapters divides the book into six parts.The first part deals with antagonistic interactions, i.e., the leaf-cutter ants. It appears that leaf-cutters collect a diversity of material, diluting the effect of toxic allelochemicals. They may collect quite inappropriate material; they have been reported to cut and bring back pieces from plastic labels.

N2  - A Gargantuan task has been accomplished: here is a complete survey of the spores of representatives of all genera of ferns and fern allies, studied with SEM and TEM. Some of the pictures have already been published in previous works of the two authors, of which Lugardon’s work has mainly been published in French; many of Tryon’s SEM pictures have appeared Tryon  Tryon (1982).In the Introduction a condensation is given of all Lugardon’s extensive studies on sporogenesis, with some new additions (e.g., spherules, p. 9). Many of his excellent, detailed micrographs are used in order to describe spore wall development in all main groups of ferns and fern allies. The section on evolutionary levels of sporoderm organization treats fern characters in a very general way and on a family level. The terms primitive, derived, and specialized are used to indicate different levels of organization of the spore wall.

N2  - This book seems to belong to – and certainly should be used side by side with – the late Marius Jacobs’ “The tropical rain forest – a first encounter” (Dutch version 1981; English edition 1988, 295 pp.), as it has much the same design and contents, and is similarly richly illustrated; it also aims at a better understanding of the necessity in saving the forest for the future. The present volume somewhat more focuses on ecology proper, tries to explain it, and tells what is happening today with the forests, to a broad reading public which surely includes politicians and all kinds of tropical scientists. There is a glossary, and for readers further interested a list of references, and a general index.The nicely executed book contains, as compared to Jacobs’, much additional information, recently discovered facts, new results of forest research, and it offers new opinions on forest ecology, formulated and seen from a somewhat different angle, as by a forester. There is a panorama of most items of tropical rain forest ecology, covered by 10 chapters, with the following headings: An introduction to tropical rain forests – What are tropical rain forests? – Plant life – Rain forest animals – Interconnections between plants and animals/the web of life – Tropical rain forests through time – Forest dynamics – Nutrients and their cycles – Species richness – Tropical rain forests yesterday, today and tomorrow.

N2  - A pollen-morphological survey of all four genera of the Stemonaceae at the light and electron microscope level is presented. Stemonaceae is a eurypalynous family. Stichoneuron pollen, up to now described as monosulcate, appears to be inaperturate. Pentastemona pollen is most deviating in Stemonaceae. Its sexine consists of elements that resemble Ubisch bodies very much. It shares several features with pollen of Peliosanthes (Convallariaceae) and Trillium (Trilliaceae). However, the closest relatives of Pentastemona could not be traced with the available pollen-morphological evidence.

N2  - This revision of all the orchid species so far recorded from the Solomon Islands and Bougainville (285 species belonging to 87 genera) has a similar layout as the previously published ‘Orchids of Vanuatu’ by the same authors. A short introduction is given to the topography, geology, vegetation, as well as the history of the botanical exploration of the area covered. The account of the species itself is written in a ‘standard’ Flora-style: a key to the genera, keys to the species of each genus, synonyms to the accepted species names, descriptions of the species, etcetera. Numerous full-page line drawings clearly depict diagnostically important parts of about half of the species, sixteen colour plates of high quality give an impression of their beauty.The identification of the orchids of the satellite achipelagos of New Guinea is riddled with problems. The work of Schlechter and J.J. Smith on the 2000 or so orchid species occurring in New Guinea itself is heavily outdated now. The species are often based on a single, or very few specimens, too few to gain an insight in the variability that many species appear to display. Besides, a proper interpretation of these species is difficult in many cases, because numerous type specimens did not survive the world war II. To discourage orchid taxonomists further, a number of species show morphological clines towards the satellite islands around New Guinea, making the identification of material from these satellites still more difficult. The easiest way out of this quagmire is to describe all taxa as new species which cannot be identified unambiguously. However, in the long ran this does not solve anything.

N2  - The orchid flora of Java has received due attention at a comparatively early stage: in the first years of this century J.J. Smith already subjected them to a comprehensive revision. In later publications he added much new information and introduced more new species. Nowadays this body of information lies rather scattered over a number of periodicals which are only present in botanical libraries. It is gathered indeed in Backer  Bakhuizen van den Brink’s Flora of Java, but this is entirely without illustrations. It is therefore not easily accessible, particularly not for the layman.James Comber’s impressive volume is a very welcome update. He provides a key to the genera, keys to the species of each genus, a description, and some additional information to each species. However, the most eye-catching feature of this volume is the presence of over 700 colour photographs scattered throughout the text, which show almost all the species mentioned. These photographs are of excellent quality and in most cases very informative. They are the result of numerous orchid-hunting trips, made during the author’s 15 years in Indonesia.

N2  - A recent exploration of Sumatra resulted in the re-collection of Curcuma sumatrana, an endemic Zingiberaceae species of unclear identity that was first described by Miquel nearly 150 years ago. The history of this species is discussed, a detailed description with a colour plate is provided and a lectotype is designated. Curcuma sumatrana currently qualifies under IUCN assessment as vulnerable, but due to the decline of its habitat, it is likely to fulfil the criteria as endangered in near future. As there is no comprehensive revision of the family Zingiberaceae for Sumatra in progress, it is meanwhile important to make accessible the characteristics of this endemic species to facilitate its proper identification and conservation management.

Fossils of fems belonging to the family in the strict sense are extremely rare and those examined do not bear any spores suitable for study. Of the fossils attributed to the family in its traditional, large sense, only a small minority belongs to the family in its strict sense.A survey of the few polypodiaceous fossils known to the author is given together with a list of non-polypodiaceous fossils that usually (sometimes tentatively) have been referred to the family Polypodiaceae.

The day after, circa 170 staff members and partners joined in the research institute for a memorable farewell party, culminating in a show around the personality of the parting Director.Bom in Delft on 5 May 1928, Kalkman used the opportunity of early retirement at the age of 62, after a long term as an active and successful administrator and coordinator of research and teaching in plant taxonomy in Leiden. This now offers him the possibility to return to taxonomic work on Rosaceae and on writing a textbook on economic botany. He also continues for a couple of years as Chairman of the Flora Malesiana Foundation, and is as such active in further internationalisation and speeding up of the Flora project.

N2  - The Asian and Australian species generally included in Diplospora or Tricalysia are shown to form an artificial assemblage. A few species even do not belong to the Gardenieae-Diplosporinae and need to be transferred to other tribes of the Ixoroideae. So Diplospora malaccensis, Diplospora minahassae, Tricalysia purpurea, and Tricalysia sorsogonensis belong to the Hypobathreae. The three Australian Diplosporas are members of the Pavetteae and are transferred to Tarenna. A survey is given of the characters of the remaining Asian species of Diplospora/Tricalysia, demonstrating that 1) these species cannot be accommodated under the African genus Tricalysia, and 2) Discospermum, since a century included in the synonymy of Diplospora, merits to be revived at generic rank. The two genera differ in placentation, fruit size and fruit wall texture, number of seeds per locule, seed shape, and exotestal cell anatomy. Eight necessary new combinations are provided: Diplospora puberula, Diplospora tinagoensis, Discospermum abnorme, Discospermum beccarianum, Discospermum whitfordii, Tarenna australis, Tarenna cameroni, and Tarenna triflora. An annotated check-list including the more than 100 names involved is given.

N2  - The two species of Mitchella (Southeast Asian and North American) and several species of the Southeast Asian genus Damnacanthus are investigated. Vegetative character states (growth form, branching pattern, leaves) of the two genera are described and compared. Damnacanthus always exhibits heterophylly and some species have paired thorns. The latter are interpreted as paired lateral shoots in the proximal part of a sympodial branch unit, and it is speculated that the paired thorns may be modified inflorescence shoots.Detailed information is also given on inflorescence structure and floral morphological and anatomical details of Damnacanthus and Mitchella. Particular emphasis is placed on the ovaries, the structure of which is remarkably similar in the two genera. The uniovulate locules are characterized by having campylotropous ovules which are inserted near the top of the septum; extensive obturator tissue covers part of the horizontally arranged curved ovule in cap-like manner. The micropyle of the ovule, obscured by the obturator, points upwards and to some degree also inwards, while the embryo sac is found in a ± horizontal position. The seeds, however, contain minute embryos, of which the radicles are pointing ± downwards. This apparently contradicting micropyle and radicle position finds its explanation in the unusual ovule structure and orientation and in the subsequent strong growth of the endosperm, through which the embryo is pushed to the position where it is found in mature seeds. The detailed structure of the drupaceous fruits and of the seeds of both genera are compared.Chromosome numbers (x = n = 11, 2n = 22) are presented for Mitchella and Damnacanthus, certain palynological information is added, and literature on reproductive biological aspects is reviewed and supplemented by original observations.While Mitchella had been associated with various different tribes, Damnacanthus was in the past nearly always placed in the Morindeae. The investigated characters overwhelmingly support the close alliance between Mitchella and Damnacanthus. However, according to our present state of knowledge, the Morindeae appear to be a heterogeneous tribe, and at least a group of genera allied to Prismatomeris is probably to be removed. Damnacanthus and Mitchella do show certain agreements with the ‘core’ of the Morindeae, but their definite tribal placement should be withheld until a recircumscription of the Morindeae becomes available.

N2  - This dictionary covers systematics, morphology, and anatomy of the Plant Kingdom, including also Fungi and Fossils. Not included are cytology, genetics, and evolution, which have been or will be treated in other volumes of the same series.As to systematics, families and higher taxa as well as many for some reason important genera have been treated. The families are taken in a broad sense. Liliaceae, to give an example, include some 25 families as accepted by many present-day botanists (Agavaceae, Alliaceae, etc.). These family names are included too, with a cross reference to the Liliaceae. (However, Agavaceae as well as Agave are only provided with a cross reference to the Amaryllidaceae; with neither of the two, nor with the Amaryllidaceae, the Liliaceae are mentioned.) Why some small exotic families like the Akaniaceae are omitted and others, as small and as exotic, for instance the Corynocarpaceae and the Eucommiaceae, are not, is not clear.

N2  - A fine book on the vegetation of Cuba in its relation to climate and soil, its phytogeographic position and subdivision. This culminates into a vegetation map 1:1,250,000, an extensive survey of plant communities, and a ‘phytosociologic table of Cuban woody communities’ where the phytosociologic and phytogeographic position of some 2,500 species, alphabetically arranged, are given. The book is profusely illustrated with hundreds of schemes, maps, vegetation transects, climate diagrams, and photos some of which in colour. It is a pity that some of the black and white photos, which are doubtless reproduced from colour slides, are too black and poor in contrasts.Hardly any tropical country has such a detailed vegetation study and the country as well as the author has to be congratulated with this excellent work.

N2  - ‘Dynamic Biogeography’ is an attempt to give biogeography its own place between other biological disciplines. Hengeveld defines dynamic biogeography as an analysis and understanding of spatial biological phenomena in terms of past and present factors and processes. Species ranges are dynamic structures varying with changing environmental conditions.The book is arranged from broad scale to fine scale patterns and processes, from classifications to detailed models of species ranges. Although this book is written from an ecological point of view, the author stresses the idea that biogeography should not be restricted to e.g. ecological or historical processes. For the herbarium systematist it will be often impossible to work with the large data collections necessary for statistical descriptions, however.

N2  - The genus Alocasia (Araceae) is revised for Australasia. Thirteen species are recognised and keyed; eleven are endemic to and one is thought to be introduced to and escaped in Papuasia; A. brisbanensis (F.M. Bailey) Domin is endemic to Australia, and is redescribed; five are new to science. The genus Xenophya Scott is reduced to synonymy with Alocasia and the new combinations A. brancifolia (Scott) A. Hay and A. lauterbachiana (Engler) A. Hay are made. Infrageneric groups (incl. Xenophya) are informally erected. Variation in shoot architecture is discussed. Line drawings are provided of previously unillustrated or obscurely illustrated species. Distributions are partly mapped. It is noted that the aroid crop plants A. macrorrhizos (L.) G. Don and Cyrtosperma merkusii (Hassk.) Schott, on the one hand, and Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson and Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott, on the other, have markedly different patterns of distribution in Australasia, suggesting two waves of eastward dispersal. Species of Alocasia recently cited as hostplants in the protologues of several spadicicolous species of Diptera Drosophilidae and Neurochaetidae are redetermined.

N2  - This beautiful flora covers one of the world’s most arid regions, 650,000 sq. km of sand, gravel, and limestone, a desert sparsely adorned by 565 species out of 322 genera of plants. Of these, 392 species and 236 genera are native; among the most extreme desertplants there are a few endemics. The most important families in number of native species are the Compositae (50, in 33 genera), the Grasses (47, resp. 31), the Chenopodiaceae (35, resp. 17), the Leguminosae (34, resp. 16), and the Cruciferae (30, resp. 22). A comparison with Bhandari’s ‘Flora of the Indian desert’, reviewed in this same issue, is interesting: though the area covered there is much smaller (some 25,000 sq. km), the numbers of genera and species as well as the most important families are nearly the same, the latter with two notable exceptions, viz. the Chenopodiaceae with 4 genera and 8 species and the Cruciferae with 6 genera and 7 species only.A few short introductory chapters give a concise but clear introduction to the topography, climate, plant geography, and vegetation. The flora proper gives keys to the families, genera, and species which seem to work well. The families and genera are provided with short descriptions. Literature was not cited, also not with the species. Under the species still commonly used synonyms, if any, are mentioned; description, habitat, distribution incl. citation of collections, vernacular names, and uses are given. Often, notes mainly on systematic questions, and sometimes rather extensive ones, are added. The book is illustrated by beautiful colour photographs, 7 of landscapes and some 250 of plants. These and the clear descriptions make drawings nearly unnecessary; these are only given for the inflorescence types of the Grasses; a few more schematic drawings, especially of the spikelet of the Grasses, could be helpful. The book is finished up by a rather extensive glossary of botanical terms, a gazetteer to the localities mentioned, a bibliography, lists of vernacular names, and an index rightly called general, as everything not yet covered in one of the other indexes seems to have been included.

N2  - In November 1989 we received from Professor R.E. Holttum his last manuscript for Flora Malesiana. He must have worked for many years to finish this publication on a very difficult group of ferns. For several reasons, not in the least because the manuscript was by no means small, it took a long time before the editing and typesetting were finished. Many new names were given and taxa described by Professor Holttum. Since new taxa are no longer published in Flora Malesiana (new style), this precursor on new species and varieties (and a few new combinations) is published in Blumea, later this year to be followed by the complete revision in Flora Malesiana, series II, volume 2¹, Pteridophyta.The following new species and varieties are described here: Tectaria andersonii, T. brevilobata, T. coadunata (J. Sm.) C. Chr. var. minor, T. croftii, T. curtisii Holttum var. hendersonii, T. danfuensis, T. devexa (Kunze ex Mett.) Copeland var. novoguineensis, T. exauriculata, T. filisquamata, T. griffithii (Baker) C. Chr. var. singaporeana and var. amplissima, T. inopinata, T. jacobsii, T. lobbii (Hook.) Copeland var. denticulata and var. allosora, T. macrota, T. microchlamys, T. microlepis, T. moussetii, T. nabirensis, T. nesiotica, T. palmata (Mett.)

N2  - This flora covers part of the Great Indian or Thar Desert, viz. the Districts of Jodhpur, Barmer, and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan State, an area of some 25,000 sq. km. It is an inhospitable region mainly of sand dunes at about 100 m above sea level. The indigenous flora of this region includes 619 species of Seedplants (78 families, 315 genera). The flora proper is preceded by a short introduction mainly on the climate, soil, and vegetation. The flora gives keys to the families, genera, and species. The names of the families are given without any citation; of the genera only the nomenclaturally relevant literature has been cited. The citation of the species is more complete and includes the nomenclaturally relevant and the main Indian literature and synonyms, mostly rather lengthy descriptions, field notes, periods of flowering and fruiting, local names, specimens studied, the distribution world-wide and in India, uses if any, and sometimes notes mainly on nomenclature.At a first glance, this flora makes a good impression. In many floras the key to the families is the weakest point. I have tried it with several tests taken at random and did not meet any difficulties. The same seems to hold true for the keys to the genera of two of the larger families, the Leguminosae with 39 genera and the Compositae with 28 genera. As to the latter key the last lead, 32b, leads to nothing, probably rightly so, and can be dropped. Furthermore, Lactuca keys out under 1 a, flowers yellowish, which agrees with most species. However, the only species in this flora, L. runcinata, is described as having the flowers pinkish white and gets stuck under 1 b accordingly. The key to the 55 genera of the largest family, the Grasses, will give lots of trouble. Lead 1 b is simply lacking; couplet 21 (17 in the first edition, with the same problems) comes from nowhere which means that 11 genera are inaccessible; the first of the three leads under couplet 28 only repeats lead 27 b and has to be dropped; couplet 31 seems to come from nowhere and encompasses three leads which are not clearly contrasting and the first of which apparently leads to nowhere – actually, lead 31 a is the lacking lead 1 b and leads to 32 and 39; couplet 33 has three leads of which only the 2nd and 3rd one are contrasting; finally, lead 55b leads to nowhere.

N2  - Celestin Alfred Cogniaux, third of eight children of a customs officer, was bom on the 7th of April, 1841, in the village of Robechies on the border between Belgium and France. A promising pupil from the start, he got his higher education at the Ecole Normale in Nivelles where he received a teacher’s diploma at the age of 22.The next ten years Cogniaux taught at five different schools until 1872, when he was offered a position at the Jardin Botanique in Brussels due to the influence of his friend and mentor, the botanist-turned-politician Barthélemy Dumortier. Apparently the student Cogniaux, alone and without guidance, had taken an interest in the local flora, especially in the mosses and hepatics. In 1862, when he was 21, Cogniaux was one of the 92 men who founded the Belgian Botanical Society, and his first scientific paper, on the alga Nitella tenuissima, appeared in the new Bulletin de la Société Royale de Botanique de Belgique the following year. Cogniaux’ later detailed floral descriptions, with many measurements, may have to do with this early focus on lower plants. Still, when 31-year-old Cogniaux was offered the position in Brussels he had yet to show his abilities as a systematist.

The descriptions are followed by a key to the four main groups and 40 patterns distinguished. This key, which is illustrated by the first ten plates, is the only place where the patterns are defined; under the descriptions they are not even mentioned.The patterns are described per genus. If there is more than one type in a genus these different types are all fully described separately and marked by a capital, without any reference to the patterns given at the end. Under each description is/are mentioned the species, under each species the one collection number of a leaf on which the description has been based. Each genus is ended up by an often extensive discussion. Nearly every specimen used is illustrated by a photograph of the cleared leaf.

N2  - This book was composed after a manuscript left by W. Troll of his work Die Infloreszenzen II, part III, chapter 5, Fischer, Jena, 1969. Part I was published in 1964, part II in 1969. Weberling elaborated and updated this manuscript, describing examples of monotelic families, in the style of W. Troll. Together the three books – all wrapped in orange covers – represent a standard work consisting of more than 1700 pages and 1436 figures. The figures are combinations of photographs of living plants, explanatory drawings, and schemes. The drawings especially show good old handwork.Because 20-25 years after the first two volumes this third book will tend to lead its own life, Weberling has included a recapitulation of the principles of polytelic and monotelic inflorescences. There is also a welcome glossary, established in cooperation with D. Müller-Doblies, in which as a surprise the English translations of the terms are also given. Remarkably, the definitions are not in every case identical to those in the glossary of Weberling’s book Morphology of the flowers and inflorescences.

N2  - Hawai’i is the most isolated major island group in the world, built up by and of volcanos and accordingly unstable but with a remarkable diversity of ecological niches. This has led to a flora on the one hand disharmonic (only three native orchids and one native genus of palms; no Gymnosperms nor primitive flowering plant families), on the other hand one of the worlds finest and most interesting ones. Though the island group is nearest to North America, most of the native flora is of Malesian affinity. In a sense, the flora is poor; one or a few colonist(s) often gave rise to a number of more or less closely related endemic species, some of which often relatively young polymorphic ones.The last complete treatment of the Hawaiian flora was Hillebrand’s ‘Flora of the Hawaiian Islands’ (1888). Since then, much work has been done, with different authors often based upon a very different species concept. This led to often strongly varying numbers of endemic species. Whereas Hillebrand accepted 705 native species, recent estimates varied between 1394 and 20,000-30,000 respectively! The authors of the present manual have tried to keep this number as low as possible; with their own words: “The main contribution of the Manual to Hawaiian botany is in providing a species concept that is probably more realistic, more functional, and more relevant to the understanding of this unique flora than anything available since the works of Hillebrand and Rock.” The total number of species here accepted is 1817; 956 of these are considered to be native and of these 89% are endemic. The number of genera accepted is 216, 15% of which are still endemic, but several of these are expected to be merged in the future with extra-Hawaiian genera. A good example of the treatment of endemic variation is to be found under Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) with 53 species accepted.

N2  - Nooteboom (Leiden Bot. Series 1, 1975, 128) described Symplocos atjehensis on the basis of four specimens from Atjeh, Sumatra. However, one of the collections, van Steenis 9697, is different from the other specimens by having glandular calyx lobes and a hairy disc. This plant is also similar to S. columbuli Noot. which was described from Atjeh, but differs from the latter by a glabrous calyx tube and glandular calyx lobes.

N2  - This book is sequel to Volume 14A, Tropical Forest Ecosystems, structure and function. Whereas the first volume deals with system ecological aspects such as community organization and processes, the present volume concentrates on biogeographical aspects such as species composition, diversity, and geographical variation. Recent ecological research in the tropical rain forest has greatly extended our understanding of biogeographical patterns on variation in the various groups of organisms and has revealed many of the ecological and evolutionary forces that led to the present patterns of variation. Many important systems of co-evolution between the tropical rain forest ecosystems have also come to light, and the loss of species and related damage is better understood in quantitative terms. This volume presents a comprehensive review of these and other features of the rain forest ecosystem structure and the ecological processes operating that system. General chapters on abiotic and biotic factors are followed by specific chapters on all major groups of organisms. Prospects of the future are discussed and research needs clearly stated. Also the human exploitation of the system, its effect and its limits are discussed. The book is extensively illustrated and comprehensive bibliographies follow each chapter. It is of the greatest value to all people who study the tropical rain forest as well as for nature conservationists and planners dealing with tropical areas. Among the authors we find the world’s most outstanding experts on the subjects, like Gillean Prance, Peter Ashton, Tim Whitmore, Eberhard Bruenig, Rob Gradstein, Norman Myers, Kuswata Kartawinata and many others. There are 35 chapters.To discuss the whole book critically would take many pages, therefore I restrict myself to a few examples. The chapters 33, the exploitation of the African rain forest and man’s impact, by R. M. Lawton, chapter 34, exploitation in southeast Asia, by K. Kartawinata et al., and chapter 35, use and misuse of tropical rain forest, by E. F. Bruenig, contain much overlap as well as difference of opinion on the subject of sustainability of exploitation. Whereas Lawton states that “the forests reserves must be managed for the production of a sustained yield of valuable timber trees and not treated as a wasting asset”, Kartawinata et al. cite Ashton: “a sound ecological basis for selective logging has never been established, and it will rarely be successful...” and Awang: “too many unknowns bear on the exploitation system.” Bruenig argues that “Timber and fuel wood harvesting in the humid tropical forest make little contribution to deforestation. Well planned and cautiously executed selective timber exploitation will not destroy the viability and regenerative vigour of the mixed rain forest ecosystem.” All authors agree that careless operating, over-mechanization, and the use of excessively heavy machinery is detrimental to the forest ecosystem. But except for a citation by Bruenig (“De Graaf considered natural silviculture with a cautious girth-limit selection and low cost silvicultural treatment to be economically viable”) none of the authors discusses the economic viability of a low intensity exploitation with current timber prices. As it is not clear yet how many trees per hectare can be cut not using heavy equipment without at least changing and sometimes damaging the ecosystem, much more emphasis should be laid on conservation and research. Relevant sources from Southeast Asia argue that before the end of the century the dipterocarp forests will be commercially depleted, and vast areas of former rain forest damaged to such a degree that regeneration will take centuries if it will take place at all. The statement of Bruenig that timber cutting makes little contribution to deforestation should be changed to the effect that – in Southeast Asia – timber cutting often leads to destruction of the primary forest ecosystem.

Due to regulations of that journal and corroborated by the short spell between acceptance and publication in Blumea, the Latin description can no longer be expected to be published as suggested. To validate the name of the new species a Latin description and a designation of the holotype is published here.

N2  - The Hamameli(i)dae comprise, according to the new classification by Thorne, about one quarter of the genera to one third of the families of the Dicotyledonae. The symposium held at the University of Reading, U.K, 22-25 March 1988, highlighted some of the many questions concerning phylogeny and evolution in this group as a contribution to the insight in the main lines of dicotyledonous evolution.The symposium report contains a wealth of information on a wide variety of topics. The phylogenetic position of the Hamamelidae in a wider or narrower sense, or parts thereof, is subject of a number of papers. F. EHRENDORFER reviews the existing diverging interpretations and concludes that the Hamamelidae can be regarded as ancient and partly relictual survivors from a broad transitional field between ancestors of Magnoliidae and Rosidae/Dilleniidae. R.F. THORNE maintains his interpretation of the Hamamelidae as a polyphyletic assemblage, but now submerges the Hamamelidanae into the Rosanae. W.C. DICKISON gives an interpretation concluding that the main rosid-hamamelid radiations probably descended from common ancestral stock characterised by largely unspecialised, insect-pollinated, bisexual flowers with petals.

He was an honorary staff member of the Fern section at the Rijksherbarium from 1974 to 1988, but his interest in Ferns dated already from before World War II. He always told that the purchase in 1939 of Backer  Posthumus, Fern Flora of Java, had started him, more or less by accident, on this group. In the course of time he acquired a sound knowledge of Ferns and after he had retired from his position as a director of a shipping-company, he still further developed his scientific interest.At the Rijksherbarium he became accepted as a knowledgeable colleague, although he did not publish much in the line of original research. He played, however, an important role in the identification of incoming Ferns and in reorganising the Ferns in the herbarium.

Hooker, and R. morindiformis (Korth.) Ridley. Rennellia includes shrubs and small trees with white to pale bluish or pale violet flowers in panicle-, umbel-, or spike-like cymes. The pedicels and ovaries are nearly always connate. Rennellia is confined to tropical rain forests in SE Asia, Sumatra, and Borneo. The genus is closely related to Gentingia, Motleyia, and Prismatomeris, but differs from these genera in, e.g., inflorescence morphology and colour of the flowers. A key to the species is presented, and all species are illustrated with line drawings and their distributions mapped.

N2  - Amazement merged with enthusiasm was my feeling after the reading of the Banksia Atlas. The production of accurate and up-to-date distribution maps being already complicated enough in tiny and densely populated countries like the Netherlands, how difficult must it be in such a vast, sparsely populated area as Australia! Yet, in a mere three years, the authors have succeeded in producing a convincingly reliable distribution atlas of all the 75 taxa of the genus Banksia (Proteaceae) occurring in Australia, based on some 25,000 records, and comprizing a fair amount of detail on the habitats of the plants and other biologically relevant data. The success of the project lies in the cooperation of some 450 active volunteers. Knowing all too well how difficult it is to convince individual volunteers to provide accurate and detailed plant records in Western European countries, it is an enormous achievement of the authors to organize such a good network of observers. The main importance of the work, of course, lies in its biological information on the marvellous genus itself, pursued especially with the aim of finding effective nature conservation measurements, e.g. in providing a sound basis for monitoring endangered species. We must assume, indeed, that the effective protection of Banksia species has come a vast step nearer to realization with this publication. For non-Australian readers, however, the Atlas will be of special interest for its part on ‘Methods and Materials’, its account on the organization of the project and its feed-back relations. Anyone involved in biological monitoring projects should read it carefully, because the book itself is an outstanding example of what can be achieved in the field of nature conservation with active support of the public itself.

N2  - A pollen morphological survey of the genus Guioa is presented. Based on a study of the harmomegathy in relation to morphological series, evolutionary trends are postulated: 1. wide ectoapertures → narrow ectoapertures 2. grain parasyncolporate → grain colporate 3. grain parasyncolporate → grain syncolporate 4. ornamentation rugulate → ornamentation psilate-imperforate.It is suggested that the most ‘primitive’ species of Guioa occur in the southeastern part of the distribution area of the genus. Guioa can be subdivided into four poorly delimited pollen morphological groups. Its affinities to other genera in the Cupanieae are briefly discussed. Pollen of the most ‘primitive’ group is similar to that of several ‘primitive’ genera (e.g. Arytera, Matayba, Molinaea, and Tina) in the tribe.

N2  - Brachypodium sylvaticum (Huds.) Beauv. has 1 species and 2 varieties in Malesia. Brachypodium longisetum Hitchc. is transferred to Elymus. The Australian genus Australopyrum (Tsvel.) Löve (Gramineae-Triticeae) is represented by a new species in New Guinea. The species is curious among grasses not only for having a thin seta at the end of the inflorescence rachis, which is unique among the Pooideae, but especially because of the uncinate awn on the glumes and lemmas. Lateral genetic transfer between families may be present. The latter two taxa represent a tribe (Triticeae) and genera thus far not recorded for the indigenous Gramineae of Malesia.

N2  - The aim of this book is stated as “to introduce the minute and mysterious world of pollen to as many readers as possible” and “to re-establish the morphological study of pollen taking into account newly accumulated phylogenetic information”. It provides introductory accounts on ontogeny, pollen morphology, pollination, pollen physiology, genetics of pollen, airborne pollen and pollinosis, and pollen analysis. Technically speaking it is a well-produced book, being bound in hard covers and neatly printed on good paper. Moreover, it is overwhelmingly illustrated. However, when looking and reading carefully through the book one gets a bit disappointed.Let us first consider the illustrations, which take up at least three quarters of the book. In general, the line drawings are clear and instructive. I doubt however, whether in fig. 1.7 (microsporogenesis) the vegetative and generative nuclei are correctly indicated. As to the photographs, one can not deny them being attractive at first sight. 92 full-page S(canning) E(lectron) M(icroscope) plates with micrographs of pollen grains, mainly from Japanese plants, form a kind of apocalyps at the end of the chapter on pollen morphology. Still, apart from revealing that “minute and mysterious world of pollen”, they are not functional, as in the text reference is made to only one of the approximately 175 micrographs. In all other cases the reader must guess at “the beautiful art work of nature”. Many of the micrographs have too high contrasts or show excessively magnified details (often a view of the whole pollen grain is lacking). And what about the plate on p. 60? The two polyads shown are actually identical, which is obscured however, by presenting one of them in a smaller size, turning it upside down, and cutting off some of the grains!

N2  - The following seven Habenaria species have been reported from the Fiji Islands: H. aliformis C. Schweinf., H. cynosorchidacea C. Schweinf., H. maculifera C. Schweinf., H. scrotiformis L.O. Williams, H. superflua Reichb. f., H. supervacanea Reichb. f. and H. tradescantifolia Reichb. f. A critical study has demonstrated that only two of this list – H. superflua and H. supervacanea — show the essential characters of the genus. The following three – namely H. aliformis, H. maculifera and H. scrotiformis – have to be transferred to Peristylus. It is noteworthy that among the subtribe Habenariinae the genus Peristylus is dominating in the Polynesian region.The situation of H. tradescantifolia Reichb. f. is somewhat confused: the type quoted by the author (‘ Seemann no. 608, ex parte’) does not correspond with the published description. From this inhomogeneous entity, the component deviating from Reichenbach‘s diagnosis has been separated by Schlechter as H. cyrtostigma, which is, according to our findings, conspecific with Peristylus papuanus (Krzl.) J.J. Smith from New Guinea. No authentic specimen has been found in herbaria matching H. tradescantifolia Reichb. f., s.str. (in conformity with the description); the nature of this taxon remains therefore obscure.Finally H. cynosorchidacea turned out to be identical with Cynorkis fastigiata Thou, from the Mascarenes. The disjunct dispersal of this plant is discussed.According to our present knowledge the following members of the Habenariinae can be recognized for the Flora of Fiji: Habenaria superflua Reichb. f., H. supervacanea Reichb. f., Peristylus aliformis (C. Schweinf.) Renz  Vodonaivalu, P. maculiferus (C. Schweinf.) Renz  Vodonaivalu, P. papuanus (Krzl.) J.J. Smith, P. scrotiformis (L.O. Williams) Renz  Vodonaivalu, and Cynorkis fastigiata Thou.

N2  - A new species from Gentianaceae (tribe Helieae) is described from northern Brazil. Sipapoantha obtusisepala sp. nov. is distinct from the previously single member of the genus, Sipapoantha ostrina, by having a woody and branched habit, sessile and ovate leaves with an acute apex, and a smaller calyx with circular lobes. Sipapoantha obtusisepala is based on somewhat incomplete material and tentatively placed in Sipapoantha based on the presence of key generic characters such as coriaceous leaves with strongly revolute margins and blue corollas. It has only been recorded from one locality in the Brazilian-Guyana border area in the state of Roraima.

N2  - The first volume of this flora appeared in 1979, followed by volume 2 in 1981 and volume 3 in 1985. The issue of volume 4 – containing the families Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Loganiaceae, Oleaceae, and Rubiaceae – means an important step towards the completion of Dr. A.C. Smith’s magnum opus. The revision of the large and difficult family of the Rubiaceae (co-authored by Dr. S.P. Darwin), in particular, must have given the author great satisfaction.The present volume follows the example set in the previous ones: detailed genus descriptions, elaborate keys to the species, whereas the species descriptions themselves are often extremely brief. This flora is rendered particularly useful by the extensive comments under each taxon, a testimony to the author’s profound personal acquaintance with the flora.

N2  - After my rather critical review of the first eight volumes of the Flora of Australia (Blumea 33: 510. 1988) it is a great pleasure to announce here the ninth, Volume 19. This is the first of three volumes on the Myrtaceae. It comprises the genus Eucalyptus, with 513 accepted species one of the largest in the Australian flora, and the closely allied genus Angophora with but seven species (and two presumed hybrids). This is the work of a single botanist, G.M. Chippendale, and we cannot but congratulate him. As such, the revision of a genus of this size is quite an achievement. This becomes something special if, like in the present case, the quality meets a very high standard indeed.Eucalyptus is taken here in its usual wide sense. It is divided into 92 series, the only taxonomic level accepted between genus and species. The key is subdivided into 20 groups, some very short (Group 17 consists of one couplet only!), some long (Group 20 encompasses 207 couplets). The keys look very simple: most leads consist of one or two characters only, clearly distinct from their opposites. I have tested the keys by identifying about 20 species taken at random on the basis of their descriptions, and the ease with which one comes to the right name, sometimes along different ways when the variability of some character so required, is surprising. The format is the usual one for this flora: accepted name and synonyms with only the original publication cited; full citation of types which apparently in this case nearly all have been seen; citation of some illustrations; rather short descriptions, about 8 lines, but here nicely parallel and hence in case of doubt easily compared; geographical distribution and habitat summarized in a few lines; citation of a few representative collections; and finally in a few lines a short characterization of the species, sometimes in comparison with one or two allied ones. Of all species and (the few) subspecies buds and fruits are illustrated by simple but clear figures and the usual small map of the distribution in Australia has been given. A point I forgot to mention in my former review is the beautiful colour photographs, in the present volume 38, depicting bark types and flowers; one could only wish to have more of them! The accepted species are followed by a list of more than a hundred presumed hybrids. A second list of some 60 ‘doubtful names’, mainly old ones the types of which are unknown, constitutes a nomenclatural time-bomb; one can but hope that the types never will be found.

Many of these are based on trivial characters, which lack diagnostic value for distinction at species level. Revisional work in progress at the Rijksherbarium suggests that less than 15 species should be recognized, but much work remains to be done before a satisfactory classification of this remarkable genus can be produced. During the course of these investigations it soon became apparent that two distinct species are still undescribed, of which one is fairly common throughout the highlands of New Guinea. They are strikingly different from all other species of the genus and they can easily be recognized by their vegetative characters alone.

The genus Mezzettiopsis Ridley has to be reinstated. — Pseuduvaria, Mitrephora, Petalolophus, Oreomitra, Schefferomitra, Goniothalmus, Exellia, Popowia, Richella, Phaeanthus, Trivalvaria and Atopostema are not closely related to Orophea as supposed by Fries (1959). — For the tribe in which Orophea has to be placed, the name Saccopetaleae Hook. f.  Thomson has to be accepted for nomenclatural reasons. Its members are Miliusa, Orophea, Mezzettiopsis, Phoenicanthus, Alphonsea and Platymitra. — Characters of the genus have been studied and a new classification below genus level has been proposed, i.e. subgenera Orophea and Sphaerocarpon Keßler, subgen. nov. — Transverse sections through the cavity of some inner petals show characteristic glandular tissue thus demonstrating that these cavities are nectary glands. — For the tribe and the genus a dichotomous and a synoptical key are provided allowing determination at least in fertile state. — The 85 known names have to be reduced to 37 species, including 11 species described as new. Some species have to be united, many have to be transferred to different genera such as Pseuduvaria, Mitrephora, Popowia, Alphonsea, Phoenicanthus, Sageraea, Guamia or Mezzettiopsis. — Distribution patterns of the genus and the species have been presented. A laurasian origin of the group is probable.

N2  - During the austral summer seasons of 1963-1964 and 1964-1965, and during the austral winter season of 1967 Prof. Dr. J.S. Zaneveld made collection expeditions to the western Ross Sea. In 1965 collections were also made from the U.S.C.G. icebreaker ‘Glacier’, around the western Ross Sea and around the Balleny Islands. During the same cruise Macquarie Island was visited. Most collecting was carried out by means of scuba-diving. Prof. Zaneveld was accompanied on these expeditions by W.I. Simmonds (1963-1964), J.M. Curtis (1964-1965), J.K. Fletcher (1964- 1965), D.M. Bresnahan (1967), and L.L. Nero (1967), during these periods students at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, U.S.A.In the harsh Antarctic environment the algae discussed in the present paper occur in aquatic habitats (freshwater, brackish water, and saline water) be it covered with ice or not, in melted snow and on icebergs.Identification and synonymy of the eleven taxa reported is based mainly on the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic literature. One of the algal taxa mentioned belongs to the Xanthophyceae and ten to the Chlorophyceae. Several of these taxa are newly recorded for the area or part of it under discussion.Some critical notes are made concerning the Antarctic Ulotrichales, as well as a short discussion on the correct name of the type species of the genus Klebsormidium. A new species of this genus is described.The species collected ar Heterococcus moniliformis Vischer, 1937; Chlamydomonas aft. ballenyana Kol in Kol  Flint, 1968, Stichococcus nivalis Chodat, 1917; Klebsormidium drouetii Wagner  Zaneveld, nov. spec.; Ulothrix implexa (Kützing) Kützing, 1849; Ulothrix australis Gain, 1911; Urospora penicilliformis (Roth) Areschoug, 1874; Monostroma hariotii Gain, 1911; Prasiola crispa (Lightfoot) Meneghini, 1837 var. antarctica (Küitzing) Knebel, 1935 forma antarctica (Kützing) Knebel, 1935; Chaetomorpha mawsonii Lucas, 1919; and Lola-irregularis Zaneveld, 1966.The remarkable vertical distribution of the chlorophyte Monostroma hariotii in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, i.e. from the lower eulittoral down to 348 meters indicates again that the factor ‘light’ is only one of the many features influencing the vertical distribution of marine algae.

The genus Euphorianthus, formerly reduced to Diploglottis, is resurrected; the three species accepted by Radlkofer are united under a new combination. 3. A revision of Sarcotoechia for New Guinea is given. Up till now, Sarcotoechia was known with certainty from Australia only. The New Guinea material represents a new subgenus with five new species, one of which remains unnamed. 4. The three species of Toechima described from Malesia are combined and reduced to a new subspecies of the Australian T. erythrocarpum. 5. A revision is given of Trigonachras. This encompasses eight species; five are new, three of these remain unnamed. The genus was known from West Malesia up to and including the Philippines; this area can now be enlarged by Celebes and New Guinea.

N2  - The Index Kewensis seems too well known for more than an announcement. On the other hand, however, it is of so great practical value to the plant taxonomist that even the slightest change may be distinctly practical or not. And thanks to the use made of the computer there are some changes this time. The most important one, distinctly for the better, is the fact that whereas Supplement 17 still came out with the about normal time lapse of seven years, Supplement 18 was published only about 1½ year after the closing date. The yearly Kew Index, the first issue of which is also announced here, will even reduce this lapse to less than one year! Furthermore, from 1986 on in the Kew Index, and accordingly in the Index Kewensis, the Ferns and Fern allies will also be included. A change to the worse was that the very practical list of ‘New and overlooked generic names listed under families’ was discontinued in Supplement 17. Luckily, this list was reinstated in Supplement 18.One wish for the Supplements to come: the computer may make it possible to give cross references from the basionym to new combinations, new names etc. Doubtless, this would make it easier to trace the way a name has gone and not to lose sight of it.

N2  - The first putative hybrid tree species of the genus Bruguiera (Rhizophoraceae), B. × rhynchopetala, is reported from mangrove forests of China and Australia. It was described from China previously as a variety of B. sexangula. The hybrid is acknowledged as B. gymnorhiza × B. sexangula with parent species restricted to different parts of the Indo-West Pacific. The hybrid is recognised at north-eastern and south-eastern parts of the overlap area between parent distributions, but it appears absent in western parts. Further local assessments are needed across the range. Hybrid status is supported by: 1) intermediate and shared morphological characters; 2) distribution limited to areas of co-occurrence of B. gymnorhiza and B. sexangula; and 3) molecular studies. However, compared with other mangrove genera with naturally occurring hybrids, this occurrence is unusual since this intermediate usually has functional flowers and fruits. Full descriptions are given for the new hybrid taxon and three larger, single-flowered Bruguiera taxa, along with distribution maps and a key.

N2  - This excellent and useful book is based on the early editions of J.C. Willis’s ‘Dictionary of the flowering plants and ferns’. Those early works have been called ‘the most remarkable botanical works of reference ever written – true vademecums for every botanists’s pocket’ (Prof. P.W. Richards). The last edition dates as far back as 1931. After that time the late Dr. Airy Shaw changed the format drastically in making a catalogue which is very useful in its own and ornates nearly every botanist‘s desk. But most of the general information had to be deleted. The omitted data were gathered again and updated by F. N. Howes of Kew, but because of his untimely death the book was not published. It is Dr. Mabberley’s merit to have taken up the task again and even to finish it. Thus a tremendous amount of general information on plants is given to be used as well by botanists as by other people who are professionally or just for the fun of it interested in this kind of information.Mabberley has taken a broad approach to family and genus concept, convinced by the arguments of the late Professor Van Steenis and Davis and Heywood. For the user this makes the book easier to work with than Airy Shaw’s editions with all that small split-off families and genera. In case of doubt Mabberley uses the broader concept, but includes entries of all the accepted and most common synonymous names. Sometimes the author of a recent revision is added, sometimes not. If a recent revision of an entire group exists the reference is given.

N2  - In Fordia, a small genus of Southeast Asian Papilionaceae, 8 species are accepted and 2 subspecies, one of which is newly described (F. splendidissima subsp. rheophytica). The name of F. splendidissima is a new combination of an old name proposed by Miquel. Six names (among which F. coriacea, F. gibbsiae, and F. filipes) are sunk into the synonymy of F. splendidissima subsp. splendidissima. Three species are excluded from Fordia. A cladistic analysis was made of the 9 taxa in Fordia and some related species. A key to the taxa, descriptions, and synonymy are given as well as 4 figures (including one map) and a table.The genus Fordia was first described by Hemsley (1886), with F. cauliflora as its only species, based on specimens collected in the Chinese province of Kwangtung.The former monographer, Dunn (1911) included 5 species in Fordia, three of which were newly described and Millettia stipularis was transferred to it.

N2  - The genus Alectryon occurs with some 30 species in E. Malesia, Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. Radlkofer (in Engl., Pflanzenr. 98, 1933: 983-1002) divided the genus into six sections. As a whole these sections are mostly well recognisable, but a clear demarcation between at least some of them appears impossible. Preference is given here to a division into three or four subgenera, which seems more justified. As Mr. George K. Linney, Honolulu, is working on the Pacific representatives of this genus and as Ms. S.T. Reynolds, Brisbane, recently completed a revision of the Australian species, I restricted myself in the present paper to the Malesian taxa.

The most diverse genus by far is Ipomoea with 25 reported species, followed by Merremia with seven species. Of the seven species initially thought to be endemic, only six are endemic to the island. Two new records are presented (Cuscuta campestris and Merremia quinata) and a new species, Argyreia paivae, is described and illustrated. Keys to genera and species are included, as well as distribution maps. The conservation of East-Timorese Convolvulaceae is analysed and it is shown that they are inadequately represented in the established natural reserves’ network.

The androecial pattern is relatively variable and its rather high plasticity in the genus is suggested to be a derived feature within the family. The gynoecial structure is most remarkable, as the stylar organs do not correspond with the placentae in number nor in position. It is assumed that these organs do not belong to the gynoecium morphologically. They may represent independent, phylogenetically secondary organs, which may function in the capturing of pollen.

N2  - This book reports on one of the symposia of the Third ICSEB Congress at Brighton, 1985. It is published only six years after the first volume in the same series (“Wallace’s Line and plate tectonics” also edited by Whitmore) treated the same problems for the same region. This is explained by the “important geological discoveries and new paleobotanical evidence” that have come available in the mean time. These discoveries are discussed in Audley-Charles’s contribution where it is stated that present-day Burma, Thailand, Malaya and Sumatra contain fragments rifted northwards from the N. Australian-New Guinea content in the Mesozoic. Being above sea-level in late Mesozoic and later they may have transported early Angiosperms.Although it may be said that the very complex geological history of the region between Asia and Australia gradually becomes clearer, this does not mean that biogeographical problems are now solved. It is still a matter of controversy where the ‘cradle’ of the Angiosperms is situated. Takhtajan in his paper considers the possibility that one of the above-mentioned rafts could be the early centre of diversification of the Angiosperms.

N2  - Molecular evidence shows the Old World genus Ryssopterys (Malpighiaceae) nested within the New World genus Stigmaphyllon; therefore, Ryssopterys is here transferred to Stigmaphyllon as subg. Ryssopterys. The subgenera share most vegetative and fruit characters. Subgenus Stigmaphyllon comprises 92 species characterized by hermaphrodite, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. Subgenus Ryssopterys includes 21 species that appear androdioecious but are probably functionally dioecious; the flowers are either hermaphrodite but likely functionally female, owing to inaperturate pollen, or male with a rudimentary gynoecium. All species have radially symmetrical flowers in which all parts of each floral whorl are equal; they lack calyx glands as well as the stylar folioles common in subg. Stigmaphyllon, for which the genus is named. The range of subg. Ryssopterys encompasses Indonesia (except Borneo and Sumatra), New Guinea, Queensland (Australia), New Caledonia, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and the Philippines; S. timoriense has also been recorded from Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. An overview of the two subgenera is given. For subg. Ryssopterys summaries of the taxonomic history and morphology, as well as descriptions, a subgeneric key and regional keys, distribution maps, and illustrations of the novelties are provided. Twelve new combinations are proposed: Stigmaphyllon subg. Ryssopterys, S. abutilifolium, S. albidum, S. angustifolium, S. australiense, S. dealbatum, S. discolor, S. grandifolium, S. gymnopodum, S. intermedium, S. taomense, S. timoriense. Ten new species are described: S. brassii, S. mackeeanum, S. mariae, S. mcphersonii, S. merrillii, S. micranthum, S. papuanum, S. pullenii, S. solomonense, S. sundaicum.

N2  - Septal nectaries are formed by local regions of later nectariferous epidermal cells on the sides of the carpels at their very base. In order that the epidermal cells may differentiate into nectariferous cells, the carpels which constitute the gynoecium have to develop as separate organs. It was argued that if no septal nectaries develop, this free carpel development does not take place. The nectariferous regions get shaped as nectar containers by dermal fusion of the sides of the carpels surrounding them, by upward growth of the apex, and mostly also by meristematic continuity of part of the ovary wall on the outside. By the latter the level of the openings of the nectaries on the ovary is defined. Septal nectaries in Monocotyledons are considered original.

N2  - The Flora of Australia started in 1981 and since then 8 volumes came out, including some 70 families. Before all we have to congratulate the editors with this achievement and we express our hope that it will be possible to go on like this.Eight volumes provide the possibility for a more general evaluation. First of all, just turning over the leaves of these volumes, one is struck by the balanced design, the clear typography, the amount of illustrations. However, on further consideration one feels some disappointment. Only once in a hundred years a Flora of Australia appears to be written, and accordingly it should be as good as possible. It is a pity then if you find too often mistakes, often unnecessary ones, and inaccuracies.

N2  - As could be announced summarily in the previous issue of Blumea, Professor Van Steenis died on 14 May 1986, after a short illness. In 1926 his first publications about Malesian plants came from the press, and so it has been a period of sixty years that he has devoted his life to the study of the Malesian flora.In Blumea 20 (1), 1972, at the occasion of his retirement as professor of Leiden University and director of the Rijksherbarium, two papers were published by, respectively, Mrs. M.J. van Steenis-Kruseman and Dr. M. Jacobs. Together they give a fairly extensive biographical picture and there seems to be no reason to reiterate the biographical facts at great length. A few highlights may suffice.

The logical stage when sex is determined is inferred to be not before the first appearance of the spikelet primordia. Female flower groups develop acropetally as triaxial cincinni, the male units as reduced ones. A developmental diagram is added.

Tasmannia) and Zygogynum, as well as one species of Bubbia. One, two and three-veined stamens were found in several taxa, in contrast to previous reports that invariably stamens have a single (median) vein. The presence of isolated, apparently vestigial, lateral veins in many stamens of some taxa, seems evidence there has been an evolutionary reduction from three- to one-veined stamens. In view of the antiquity of the Winteraceae, this lends support to the hypothesis of Bailey and Nast, that three-veined stamens are a primitive feature of the woody Ranales. No obvious correlation was found between stamen morphology and type of pollinator.

N2  - Fourteen species and one subspecies of the fern genus Hypolepis Bernh. are recognised in the Malesian and Pacific regions, excluding Australia and New Zealand. Three species, H. hawaiiensis, H. malesiana and H. scabristipes, and one subspecies, H. elegans subsp. carolinensis, are described for the first time. Two widely misapplied names, H. punctata (Thunb.) Mett. and H. tenuifolia (Forst. f.) Bernh. are more clearly defined. Descriptions, distributional data and a key for identifying all fourteen species are provided. Five species, H. alpina, H. archboldii, H. bamleriana, H. malesiana and H. scabristipes, are confined to the Malesian region; four species, H. brooksiae, H. pallida, H. polypodioides and H. punctata, extend also to the Asian mainland; three species, H. dicksonioides, H. elegans and H. hawaiiensis, are confined to the Pacific region and two, H. glandulifera and H. tenuifolia, have a wide distribution from mainland Asia to the Pacific. Four species, H. dicksonioides, H. elegans, H. glandulifera and H. tenuifolia, are shared with Australia and New Zealand where a further eight endemic species occur.

N2  - This paper deals with a group of species of the Neotropical genus Guatteria (Annonaceae) which are characterized by leaves with tiny warts (verruculae) on both surfaces and by elongate and short-stipitate monocarps (i.e., the length of the monocarp body surpassing the length of the stipe). These species were placed by Fries in Guatteria sect. Mecocarpus (Fries 1939) (the name derives from Ancient Greek μηκων = Poppy and καρπος = fruit: fruit resembling that of Papaver species). All occur in South America, none having been found elsewhere so far. Although there is much doubt nowadays about the taxonomic significance of Fries’s sections, we maintain sect.Mecocarpus at present for convenience’s sake. Additionally, the former genus Guatteriopsis, united with Guatteria a short time ago (Erkens  Maas 2008b), is now also included in sect. Mecocarpus. The same applies to one of the two species attributed to Guatteriella (also merged with Guatteria by Erkens  Maas 2008b), namely Guatteriella tomentosa R.E.Fr. (not Guatteria tomentosa Rusby) which is put into synonymy with Guatteria trichocarpa Erkens  Maas. One new species is described, namely Guatteria griseifolia Maas  Westra. The two species complexes of G. guianensis and G. decurrens are now treated each as a single polymorphic species. The present study falls within the framework of a planned monograph of the whole genus Guatteria.

Some of the more interesting finds are discussed in some detail, and one species, Spermothamnion antillarum, is described as new to science. Twelve species are recorded from the island for the first time. A survey of all Ceramiaceae ever recorded from Curaçao yields a total of 60 species, an uncommonly high number for any Caribbean region. Explanations for this high number may be found in the large variety of habitats and the relatively intense study the marine environment has undergone on this island.

N2  - Monographic studies in Pandanaceae continue to yield previously unrecognized taxa both at specific and higher ranks. In Pandanus, with the increase of knowledge of staminate structures becoming available through better collections and more critical observations, use of staminate characters integrated with previously known data is providing important new insights into infrageneric taxa and their affinities, as well as completing the fundamental descriptions at species rank important for both systematic and ecological studies. In the results reported here two new species, Pandanus calvus and P. kosteri, and two new sections, Hastatistigma (based on P. vinaceus) and Macrokurzia (based on P. daymanensis) are proposed. Two species previously known only from pistillate materials, P. cernuifolius and P. irregularis, are clarified by description of staminate specimens, while in the case of P. copelandii, a previously unrecognized staminate feature is described. Field data for the inadequately known species P. leptocarpus are provided, and the first illustrations of the type specimen (staminate) of P. houlletii are provided. These taxa are discussed under the subgenera to which they are referred in the synopsis (Stone, 1974).

N2  - The species Geophila erythrocarpa (Rubiaceae) is described and illustrated. The new species is restricted to dry, dense forests of the Katanga province in D.R.Congo and the adjoining Copperbelt province in Zambia. The species is similar to and in the herbarium easily confused with G. obvallata from which it most clearly differs in having red instead of blue or black fruits. In flowering state, the two species can be separated by differences in calyx morphology. The new species shares the red-coloured fruits with G. afzelii, but differs from this species in the undivided stipules, the fewer-flowered inflorescences with smaller bracts, and details of the leaf coloration. The new species is further compared with all other Geophila species reported from Zambia and D.R.Congo whereby G. obtusifolia is reduced to synonymy under G. renaris and G. aschersoniana is reduced to synonymy under G. obvallata. An IUCN conservation assessment has been made and the species is provisionally assessed as Endangered, based on its restricted area of occupancy, the small number of known locations, and the continuing decline in extent and quality of its habitat.

N2  - The tropical ecosystem has been considered by many authorities as a stable vegetation type that, in some areas, has ‘existed uninterruptedly since a very remote geological time’ (Richards, 1952). The long term stability of rainforest ecosystems was first questioned when studies showed that there was a marked contraction of rainforest areas in the tropics during Pleistocene times (Flenley, 1979). Within New Guinea two major effects are reported: altitudinal fluctuation of the major vegetation zones at higher altitudes, as described by Flenley (1972), Hope (1976), Powell (1970), and Walker (1970); and a decrease in precipitation. As a result of the lower rainfall during the Pleistocene era (17,000—14,000 yrs BP) extensive areas of New Guinea were characterised by a very dry savanna type climate (Nix  Kalma, 1972). This is still reflected in the distribution of savanna elements in the present vegetation, in both lowland and lower montane areas.However, extensive disturbances are by no means restricted to the Pleistocene times. Studies in New Guinea show that the environment has been recently subjected to major disturbances caused by natural disasters. These phenomena are often easily plotted from aerial photographs and by using remote sensing techniques. An understanding of environmental instability is important, not only for the interpretation of the structure and floristics of the extant vegetation, but is also of major importance in the management of the tropical environment in New Guinea.

N2  - In Gymnacranthera, a small genus of Southeast Asian Myristicaceae, at present 7 species have been accepted, one (G. forbesii) with 2 and another ( G. farquhariana) with 4 varieties. One species, G. canarica, occurs in S. India, the remainder of the species is distributed in the area from S. Thailand east to E. New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago; the genus is absent from Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands. Species distinction is difficult because the androecium, which provides good characters in most other Southeast Asian Myristicaceae, is particularly uniform in Gymnacranthera. Two new species, G. ocellata from Borneo and G. maliliensis from Celebes, have been described. Some of the varieties are new combinations. The Indian G. canarica is distinct by globose fruits and by the anthers of which the large free apical portions are ± spreading, rather than erect or incurved. The Malesian G. bancana differs from the other Malesian species by its stout habit, conspicuous tomentum, and large flowers (male perianth 4-6 mm long) with relatively small androecium. The name of one common species, by Sinclair named G. eugeniifolia (with 2 varieties), is presently changed into G. farquhariana, an old name proposed by Hooker f.  Thomson. The distinction of Gymnacranthera among the other Southeast Asian genera of the Myristicaceae is discussed, the androecium newly described and pictured, and an ample genus description and full taxonomic treatment of all species is presented. An index of all names pertaining to Gymnacranthera is given at the end.

N2  - The early development of the stamens in Stemona and Stichoneuron is similar, in spite of significant differences in the adult stages. Moreover, as the peculiar gynoecia in both genera are chiefly similar, their mutual affinity seems substantiated. It is concluded that Stichoneuron is very close to Croomia, so that these genera can be merged. However, Pentastemona is different. In its androecium it shows a corona-like development of the basal staminal region (like Peliosanthes, Convallariaceae). Therefore, the removal of Pentastemona from the Stemonaceae is corroborated. The late differentiation of its stamens into extensions that contact the stigma, as well as the inferior position of the ovary, suggest a relationship with Trichopus (Trichopodaceae) and Stenomeris (Stenomeridaceae).

N2  - The discriminating characters of some genera of the family Stemonaceae (incl. Stemona) and the genus Pentastemona (formerly in the Stemonaceae) have been amply discussed by the present author (1991). The discussion resulted in the statement that Pentastemona represents a family of its own, Pentastemonaceae, beside Stemonaceae. The forthcoming treatment of both families in Flora Malesiana (Duyfjes, 1992) requires the formal description of Pentastemonaceae. The supporting considerations for the distinction of the new family are briefly enumerated again: Pentastemonaceae (Pentastemona) Stemonaceae Growth habit monopodial sympodial Leaves dispersed distichous, opposite or verticillate Petioles shortly sheathing at the base not sheathing at the base Scale leaves on the rootstocks no scale leaves present Inflorescences essentially compound not compound Flowers 5-merous, tepals and stamens in one whorl each 4-merous, tepals and stamens each in two whorls of two Stamens connectives, together with the top of the hypanthium and the ovary grown into a complicated disk-like structure filamentous, connectives narrow or broad, mostly with conspicuous appendages; see Van Heel (1992) Ovary inferior with three parietal placentas; ovules many, anatropous superior (Stemona) or semi-inferior (Stichoneuron), with placentas basal (Stemona) or apical ( Stichoneuron), with few or many anatropous or semi-anatropous ovules Pedicels not articulated articulated Fruit inferior, berry-like superior (Stemona) or semi-inferior (Stichoneuron); Seed seeds with sarcotesta-like hyaline exotestas; arillode inflated a 2-valved capsule seeds without sarcotesta-like exotestas; arillode various, not inflated; see Bouman  Devente (1992) Pollen Exine inaperturate, scabrate sexine architecture distinct from Pentastemona; see Van der Ham (1991)
