N2  - Both floral morphology and leaf anatomy proved to be of little value in distinguishing the three variants of the Darwinia diosmoides complex. Morphometric analysis of foliar characters confirmed that the northern variant, which differs in chromosome number and several other respects, should be recognized as a new species (D. capitellata Rye). However, the two southern variants showed complete intergradation in their foliar characters; hence they were not considered sufficiently distinct to be given formal taxonomic rank.

N2  - A new taxonomic series, Rigentes, endemic to Western Australia is described. It comprises Eucalyptus rigens from north-west, north and north-east of Esperance, E. litorea from near Israelite Bay, both occurring around salt lakes, and E. famelica from east of Hopetoun, a species of subcoastal swamps. The series belongs in the informal Eucalyptus sect. Dumaria of Pryor & Johnson and is characterised by brown, somewhat flat to pyramidal seed, with the ventral side ribbed and dorsal side shallowly pitted.

N2  - Banksia seminuda subsp. remanens and B. occidentalis subsp. formosa are described and illustrated. Both have smaller leaves, are more floriferous and are smaller shrubs than their respective nominate subspecies. Both have outstanding horticultural merit. Their conservation in the wild will necessitate careful management, as both new subspecies may be killed by fire, and both have restricted geographical distributions. B. seminuda subsp. remanens and B. occidentalis subsp. formosa each have a distribution and morphological features suggesting that they are relictual taxa of Western Australian lineages that show the closest relationships to eastern Australian members of Banksia section Oncostylis.

One of these is described as new, namely O. humilis Lander. Another represents O. xerophila (F. Muell.) F. Muell. ex Benth., previously known only from Queensland. O. stuartii is recognised as being a species widespread in inland Australia. A related species, O. gordonii Lander, is described from southern Queensland. These taxa all fall within Olearia sect Merismotriche Benth. within which they form a natural group.

New taxa are treated in the order and nomenclature of the Flora of Australia Volume 19 (1988) from which we deviate only when we consider an updated treatment necessary. The new series Falcatae is erected and divided into two subseries, Falcatae and Decipientes. The series Micrantherae s.s. is expanded to include the new subseries Bakerianae, and a new series Balladonienses is erected. E. lane-poolei of series Curviptera is segregated in the new E. subseries Inflexae, E. caesia in the new E. series Caesiae, while E. series Orbifoliae comprises the remaining Minni Ritchi species. A new subseries Cupreanae is erected in E. series Lucasianae. Diagnostic notes on each taxonomic series are given at the head of the relevant groups of species throughout the paper. The new taxa are illustrated, except for E. ebbanoensis subsp. photina and E. marginata subsp. thalassica for which leaf colour and leaf gloss are the diagnostic characters, E. marginata subsp. elegantella and E. macrocarpa subsp. elachantha for which habit, bark characters and leaf, bud and fruit dimensions are the diagnostic characters and E. decipiens subspp. chalara and adesmophloia for which bark characters only are diagnostic. Distribution maps are provided. All the new taxa are endemic to Western Australia except for E. glomerosa and E. kingsmillii subsp. alatissima, both of which extend into the desert region of South Australia.

N2  - A new species of Nemcia, N. effusa Crisp &amp; Mollemans, is described from the north-west part of Lake Grace shire, south-west Western Australia. The species is quite distinct with no clear affinities. It is named for its habit with rigid, diffuse stems and branchlets. In some respects similar to N. stipularis (Meissner) Crisp, it differs in the leaves spreading widely and being broader(3-4 mm) and impressed-punctate below, and with stipules shorter (2-3 mm). It is also similar to N. punctata (Turcz.) Crisp in the leaves being impressed-punctate below, but differing in having conspicuous stipules and longer leaves (1-2.5 cm) that are spreading widely but scarcely recurved. Only two plants of N. effusa were found at the type locality, and the species was not observed elsewhere during surveys of remnant vegetation (by the second author) of c. 71,250 km2 of the southern wheatbelt region of Western Australia. This suggests that N. effusa is neither widespread nor common.

Chamaexeros longicaulis is most closely related to C. serra but differs in several characteristics including three unique in the genus: elongated stems, elongated rhizomes resulting in vegetative reproduction, and thickened vertical rhizomes which presumably provide for storage of reserves. The species is of conservation interest owing to the small number of populations known, and is listed among conservation priority taxa for Western Australia. A revised key to the species of Chamaexeros is presented. Features of the ovary, capsule and seed are clarified for this genus. Floral measurement data are given for all species. A range extension is noted for C. serra.

N2  - Robert Brown published nine new species of Acacia in W.T. Aitonâ€™s second edition of "Hortus Kewensis". In the past, typification of these species has presented problems for two main reasons. Firstly, there were uncertainties regarding the material on which they were based, i.e. Brownâ€™s "wild" gatherings from Australia between 1801 and 1805, and/or from plants in cultivation in England. Secondly, it appears that there are no cultivated specimens extant which can be regarded as type material. There is, however, a collection by William McNab, a gardener at Kew, who made specimens of Brownâ€™s Acacia species from cultivated plants at Kew between 1806 and 1809; this collection is curated by the National Herbarium at Dublin (DBN). The following Brown species names are here lectotypified on the basis of Brownâ€™s "wild" material: A. alata, A. biflora, A. marginata (=A. myrtifolia), A. melanoxylon, A. pulchella and A. sulcata; a neotype for A. acicularis (=A. brownii) has been chosen from Brownâ€™s "wild" collections while A. armata is neotypified on a cultivated plant in the William McNab collection at DBN. One species, A. ciliata (= A. browniana var.browniana), had been neotypified in a previous paper.

Seven new species and two new infraspecific taxa of Acacia are described, namely, A. aemula Maslin which comprises two subspecies, subsp. aemula and subsp. muricata Maslin (syn. A. tetragonocarpa var. scabra Benth.), A. alata var. tetrantha Maslin, A. applanata Maslin, A. bifaria Maslin, A. carens Maslin, A. cerastes Maslin, A. cummingiana Maslin and A. pterocaulon Maslin. The taxonomy of A. alata R. Br. Is briefly assessed and the species is now viewed as comprising four varieties, namely, var. alata, var. biglandulosa Benth., var. platyptera (Lindl.) Meisn. and var. tetrantha Maslin. A description is provided for A. volubilis F. Muell.; this species is possibly extinct and seems related to A. aemula. Acacia glaucoptera Benth., a close relative of A. bifaria, and A. willdenowiana H. Wendl. (based on A. diptera Lindl.), a closerelative of A. applanata, are lectotypified.

Anthocercis sylvicola is most closely related to A. genistoides Miers and A. anisantha Endl., but differing most obviously in the smaller green and purple flowers. It is the only member of the genus confined to tall open-forest. Although restricted, its distribution shows a marked discontinuity, a common situation for conservative, relictual high-rainfall taxa in the area. The species is of conservation interest owing to the small area of distribution and small number of plants and populations known. It is listed among conservation priority taxa for Western Australia. A revised key to the spinescent species of Anthocercis is presented.

N2  - Lambertia rariflora subsp. lutea Hnatiuk is a recently described tall shrub or small tree from the Walpole Region, south western Australia (Hnatiuk 1995). At the time of its original description the taxon was known from only two collections, habitat details were few, and information on abundance and geographical distribution inadequate. Consequently it has been considered to be possibly rare. As part of our work on a Recovery Plan for the rare, endangered and conservation priority flora of the Department of Conservation and Land Managementâ€˜s Southern Forest Region (Hearn et al. in prep.), we undertook a field survey of L. rariflora subsp. lutea . The results are reported here ahead of the Recovery Plan in order to improve the available published information on the species as soon as possible.

Since publication of the Kimberley flora, a further species and genus, Colubrina asiatica, has been discovered at Koolama Bay in the far north of the Kimberley, and there has been an alteration of the specific name used for the Alphitonia species in the region. In addition, unpublished work on generic boundaries in the Rhamnaceae suggests that the species currently known as Cryptandra intratropica should be placed in a new genus (K. Thiele pers. comm.).

N2  - Typhonium Schott is a genus of about 40 species of East Asian and Australian geophytic, mostly saproentomophilous aroids, the largest genus of the eastern-hemispheric tribe Areae. Typhonium has been revised recently for Australia (Hay 1993) and in toto (Sriboonma 1994), with the subsequent addition of three new species in Australia (Hay 1996; Hay &amp; Taylor 1997). Several further new species are also coming to light in Indochina (Dzu &amp; Croat 1997; Hetterscheid, pers. comm.). Here we describe another new Australian species, bringing the total for Australia to 17, of which all but two are endemic. A key to Australian Typhonium, including this new species, will appear in the forthcoming treatment for &ldquo;Flora of Australia&rdquo; (Hay, in prep.).

N2  - A single large (rhizome length 0.4 m, leaf length 0.5 m) individual of the cosmopolitan fern Histiopteris incisa (Thunb.) J. Sm. (Dennstaedtiaceae) was located on the lower south-western slopes (altitude 110 m) of Mt Lindesay on 3 January 1999. The plant was found growing in a partially shaded, horizontal crevice of a large granite boulder 1.5 m from the ground and 100 metres up a steep slope to the east of the Denmark River. The general area included substantial areas of outcropping in otherwise woodland/forest habitat. This is the first record of this species from south-western Australia, and increases the pteridophyte flora (ferns and fern allies) of the Jarrah Forest Bioregion to 30.

N2  - A key and distribution map for all taxa of Eucalyptus ser. Orbifoliae Brooker &amp; Hopper are provided. Eucalyptus minniritchi Nicolle is described to accommodate populations of mallees in central Australia previously referred to as E. orbifolia F. Muell. or E. websteriana Maiden and related to both. The new species differs from E. orbifolia in the smaller buds with a short hemispherical operculum, the smaller and narrower adult leaves and the generally smaller, hemispherical fruits and differs from E. websteriana in the consistently and strongly pruinose adult parts and generally coarser leaves, peduncles, pedicels, buds and fruits. E. lata L.A.S. Johnson &amp; K.D. Hill, a species recently described to accommodate what is here recognized to be typical E. orbifolia, is synonymised with that earlier named species. The status of E. educta L.A.S. Johnson &amp; K.D. Hill and its relationship to E. orbifolia is discussed.

N2  - A taxonomic revision of Lysiosepalum F. Muell., a genus endemic to south-western Australia, identified five species. These comprise two currently accepted species L. involucratum (Turcz.) Druce and L. rugosum Benth., the reinstated L. hexandrum (S. Moore) S. Moore and two new species L. abollatum C.F. Wilkins (CALM Priority One) and L. aromaticum C.F. Wilkins (CALM Priority Two) that probably require recognition as Declared Rare Flora. A cladogram based on morphological data indicates that Lysiosepalum is a monophyletic genus, strongly supported by three synapomorphies unique in tribe Lasiopetaleae: calyx tube very short (lobes scarcely fused at the base); calyx lobes of alternating broad and narrow widths; epicalyx bracts equally spaced to completely enclose the mature bud. A chromosome number of n = 10 for L. involucratum is the first published record for the genus.

Most species belong to the latter category, including the lectotype selected here for the genus, Micromyrtus drummondii Benth. nom. superfl. [= M. obovata (Turcz.) J.W. Green]. A key is given to the 14 Western Australian members of this group, and the eight south-western species, including five new species, are revised.

Oâ€™Sullivan 127, 357, 812, 968, 966, 1183, 1190, 1193, 1194). This study assessed populations of E. angustissima subsp. angustissima, E. angustissima subsp. quaerenda, E. foliosa and E. misella and found all four taxa to be genetically distinct. Eucalyptus angustissima was not monophyletic as the two subspecies did not cluster together. Eucalyptus misella was sister species to E. angustissima subsp. angustissima, and E. foliosa was sister species to both these taxa. Eucalyptus angustissima subsp. quaerenda was the most distinct of the four taxa.

N2  - A new myrtaceous genus endemic to south-western Australia is described as Enekbatus Trudgen &amp; Rye. It is related to Rinzia Schauer and several other genera, all of which have an unmodified anther type, a multilocular ovary and reniform seeds. However, the indehiscent fruit of the new genus separates it from all other members of this group. Ten species are recognised here, of which seven are newly described as Enekbatus bounites Trudgen &amp; Rye, E. cristatus, E. dualis, E. eremaeus, E. longistylus, E. planifolius and E. sessilis. The new combinations Enekbatus cryptandroides (F. Muell.) Trudgen &amp; Rye, E. clavifolius (S.Moore) Trudgen &amp; Rye and E. stowardii  (S.Moore) Trudgen &amp; Rye, are made for three species that were previously included in Baeckea L. s. lat.

Both species, together with E. lane-poolei, are in the earliest branching clade of E. ser. Curviptera, which contains many horticulturally attractive large-flowered mallees from semi-arid and desert regions such as E. macrocarpa and E. youngiana. The discovery and description of these two rare relictual forest trees so recently highlights the need for ongoing botanical survey of south-western Australiaâ€™s forests. A phantom hybrid, Eucalyptus lane-poolei Ã— relicta, is also described for the first time. It occurs close to populations of E. relicta in the Whicher Range but 150 km south of the nearest recorded E. lane-poolei.

N2  - Astus Trudgen & Rye, a new genus of Myrtaceae with four species endemic to the south-west of Western Australia, is described and its affinities discussed. While the genus is circumscribed on the basis of a range of characteristics that separate it from related genera, all its members are unusual in having a fruit with both dehiscent and indehiscent loculi. In addition, two of the species have a marked heteromorphy in their calyx lobes. Astus is one of a number of genera belonging to the tribe Chamelaucieae that have reniform seeds. While the floral morphology of the new genus does not readily indicate which of the other reniform-seeded genera it is closest to, DNA evidence indicates affinities to the Eastern Australian genus Triplarina Raf. The type species, Astus tetragonus (F. Muell. ex Benth.) Trudgen & Rye, is based on Baeckea tetragona F. Muell. ex Benth. Astus duomilius Trudgen & Rye, A. subroseus Trudgen & Rye and A. wittweri Trudgen & Rye are new species. A key to the species, descriptions, illustrations and distribution maps are provided.

N2  - A form of heterocarpidy with dehiscent and indehiscent loculi present in the same fruit is described from species in two genera of Myrtaceae occurring in the south-west of Western Australia. This extreme development of heterocarpidy results in a very unusual fruit type, one that has not previously been described for the Myrtaceae. It is also apparently rare in the angiosperms, although smaller differences between carpels (mostly in their size and the number of seeds) are not uncommon. In Astus Trudgen & Rye and the Baeckea robusta F. Muell. complex, two types of ovary loculi develop, with one type dehiscent by a suture on the floral disc and the other type lower in the ovary and indehiscent. The occurrence of this heterocarpidic fruit type in two fairly different genera is considered to be a convergent development rather than indicating a particularly close relationship. The heterocarpidic fruit in these groups is described and illustrated, and its adaptive and taxonomic significance discussed.

N2  - Eucalyptus sargentii subsp. onesia Nicolle subsp. nov. is described. It is known from less than ten small populations in the central wheatbelt of southwest Western Australia, with all populations occurring on highly saline sites and possibly endangered by increasing salinisation. E. sargentii subsp. onesia differs from subsp. sargentii primarily in the lignotuberous, mallee habit, making it preferable to subsp. sargentii for salt reclamation projects, due to its propensity to regenerate following fire or cutting. Extensive field examination, seedling trials and observations of cultivated material have indicated that E. sargentii subsp. fallens is not specifically distinct from E. diminuta and I regard the former as synonymous with the latter. E. diminuta is recircumscribed to include populations from Eurardy Station in the north to near Watheroo in the south.

N2  - The name Stylidium leptocalyx Sond. has been misapplied for many years. This trigger plant is now recognised to be of restricted distribution in the wandoo country south-west of York, and is characterised by pink flowers with linear calyx lobes, arranged in a loose, corymb-like raceme. Stylidium stenosepalum E.Pritz. is reinstated to account for the northern sandplain entity previously known as S. leptocalyx. This species differs from S. leptocalyx in possessing white flowers with a longer corolla tube and column. Amended descriptions and floral images are provided for both species, along with the morphologically-allied S. scabridum Lindl.

N2  - The systematics of Western Australian members of Brown's (1810) genus Eriochilus R.Br. has been controversial, confused and poorly understood. This paper provides a revision drawing upon recent fieldwork, collections and herbarium studies that considerably resolve the taxonomic situation. We describe the following taxa as new: E. helonomos, E. pulchellus, E. valens, E. dilatatus subsp. magnus, E. dilatatus subsp. orientalis, E. dilatatus subsp. undulatus, and E. scaber subsp. orbifolia. New combinations are E. dilatatus Lindley subsp. multiflorus (Lindley) Hopper and A.P. Br. and E. dilatatus Lindley subsp. brevifolius (Benth.) Hopper and A.P. Br. The genus is thus enlarged in Western Australia to 6 species. E. dilatatus is geographically variable, now with six subspecies. E. scaber subsp. orbifolia is the only threatened taxon in Western Australia, known from a single locality near Walpole.

N2  - Successively for the past ten years a distinctive, large fungus superficially resembling the northern hemisphere Magpie Fungus Coprinopsis picacea  syn. Coprinus picaceus has been observed for the first time in Western Australia (WA). The fungus is a member of the section Coprinus subsection Alachuani. Based on morphological and habitat attributes, the WA fungus is considered in this paper to be affiliated with Coprinopsis stangliana syn. Coprinus stanglianus. C. stangliana is known from calcareous soil, limestone, and chalk in Europe and Turkey, but has not been confirmed in Australia. In WA, C. stangliana generally has larger fruit bodies than reported for this species elsewhere. The fungus produces abundant fruit bodies in highly disturbed patches within numerous urban bushlands of the Perth region. The apparent recent establishment of such a conspicuous fungus, and observations of its fruiting patterns over successive years suggest that it is rapidly spreading following a relatively recent introduction into the Perth region.

The new species is known from just two populations near Norseman in Western Australia and is included in Western Australiaâ€™s Schedule of Declared Rare (Endangered) Flora. The new species is closely related to, but readily distinguishable from, E. diversifolia, differing in the narrower juvenile leaves, the consistently 7-flowered inflorescences, the longer, conical to horn-shaped operculum, the broader fruits with a consistently broad disc and the granite hill habitat. Eucalyptus platydisca is probably a relictual species and occurs in the lowest rainfall environment of any monocalypt (Eucalyptus subgenus Eucalyptus). The new species is part of E. subser. Neuropterae, and a key for the subseries is presented.

N2  - The myrtaceous genus Balaustion Hook. is reduced to its original monotypic circumscription. Balaustion s. str. is closely related to Tilophloia Trudgen &amp; Rye ms., both genera having stamens in a single circular series, broad filaments, a very large placenta and seeds with a large concave hilum, but Balaustion is distinguished by its prostrate habit with adventitious roots, basifixed anthers and long tubular flowers adapted to pollination by birds. A second bird-pollinated species with elongated flowers, previously known as B. microphyllum C.A.Gardner, is transferred into the new genus Cheyniana Rye as C. microphylla (C.A.Gardner) &nbsp;Rye. Since the type material of this species is missing, it is lectotypified on the original illustration. Another large-flowered species, but with more spreading, apparently insect-pollinated flowers, is described as C. rhodella Rye &amp; Trudgen. Cheyniana is related to also Oxymyrrhine Schauer, which it resembles in its very reduced anthers and narrow filaments, but differs in its large colourful petals and woody indehiscent fruit. Both of the small genera treated in this taxonomic revision belong to the tribe Chamelaucieae and are restricted to the south-west of Western Australia.

N2  - Two new native species, Puccinellia longior and P. vassica, have been identified from Western Australia. P. longior is restricted to the outer edges of salt lakes and salt-affected pasture land along the lower western margin of the southwest wheatbelt region in WA, and has also been collected from a saline wetland reserve in southeast South Australia. P. vassica is endemic to the outer edges of marine saltmarsh in reserved areas of the Leschenault Inlet near Bunbury. It was previously known from the nearby Vasse-Wonnerup saltmarsh near Busselton but is now extinct there because engineering works have reduced the marine influence in the estuary. It may be on the verge of extinction in the Leschenault Inlet also because (a) it lives on the outer edge of the high tide influence and is thus prone to weed invasion from non-saline areas, (b) its culms disintegrate almost entirely each year so it provides little resistance to competition, and (c) it has a low recruitment rate, with only a few scattered plants surviving at each site. The most common species is Puccinellia stricta, which occurs on the margins of salt lakes and salt-affected pastoral land throughout the southwest wheatbelt region, from Hutt River in the north to the Esperance region in the east. WA collections of this species differ from those elsewhere in southern Australasia, but in a continuous way that did not easily yield taxonomic distinction. The main source of variation is probably that the WA habitats all have to endure long summer drought each year. The agriculturally introduced Middle-Eastern species P. ciliata is well naturalized in saline lands in southwest WA, and a single collection of the introduced P. gigantea is recorded. Other introduced species appear to have not survived.

Wilson (formerly Halosarcia indica (Willd.) Paul G. Wilson) was the only member of the Salicornioideae that was known to have a modified Kranz anatomy indicative of the C4 photosynthetic pathway. Anatomical evidence indicates that T. bibenda shares a similar modifi ed anatomy. While T. bibenda is related to T. indica, it is distinguished by the presence of unusually large vegetative and fertile articles and having paired cymes of (4)5&ndash;7 flowers rather than the more typical 3-flowered cymes. This species is restricted to the flood zones and fringing spinifex/samphire heath of several gypsiferous playa and salt lake systems in the Little Sandy Desert of Western Australia. Due to its restricted distribution this species has a Priority three conservation status.

N2  - Pentapogon quadrifidus is thus known from three separate locations where it grows in consistent habitats among native vegetation in good condition. At each site it is scattered through the vegetation at varying densities but never dominating. From this pattern we concluded that the species is most likely to be native to Western Australia. We assume that it has been overlooked because it occurs in only a few sites, is inconspicuous, and superfi cially resembles Austrodanthonia species, especially A. setacea. Because of its apparently localised distribution it had a Priority 1 conservation rating for Western Australia in Atkins (2006). It is now considered to carry a Conservation Code for Western Australian Flora: Priority 2 following the discovery of the population in a nature reserve. This survey has achieved some of the management requirements listed for this species by Hearn et al. (2006).

The species is restricted to banded ironstone ranges which accounts for its discontinuous distribution between Mt Jackson (130 km north of Southern Cross) and near Mt Magnet (c. 270 km north-west of Mt Jackson). Sterile specimens from north of Mt Magnet require confirmation as being this species. Acacia cockertoniana is often abundant in the places where it occurs and current evidence suggests that it is most common in the vicinity of the Windarling Range. Acacia cockertoniana appears to be most closely related to A. balsamea Cowan &amp; Maslin.

One of these, D. fulva A.S.Markey &amp; R.A.Meissn., has close affinities to D. microphylla Paul G.Wilson but differs in having a reddish apiculus on the leaf apex, tawny new growth, and sub-orbicular, flattened sepals. The other, D. rubroviridis R.A.Meissn, is closely allied to D. wilsonii F.H.Mollemans, from which it is distinguished by a combination of spreading leaves, solitary, larger red flowers with green petal lobes, and a pointed apical leaf gland. Drummondita fulva is relatively widespread, occurring on both Banded Iron Formation and associated metasedimentary rocks in the Yalgoo region, while D. rubroviridis has a restricted distribution and appears to be endemic to a single banded ironstone range in the Koolanooka Hills.

While its leaf morphology and anatomy closely ally P. manotricha with P. bowgada, the new species can be distinguished by its longer pedicels and by its flowers being less pubescent with a glabrous to sparsely pubescent ovary, similar to those of P. hexagona. Comparative leaf anatomy confirms that P. hexagona is distinctly different in having relatively broad longitudinal grooves in its leaves. The characteristic darkness of these broad grooves, in dried specimens, is not exclusively the result of the stomatal guard cells blackening, as previously thought, but also results from the greater visibility of the underlying mesophyll. Persoonia manotricha is commonly found on the lower, rocky slopes of Banded Iron Formation (BIF) ranges in tall Acacia dominated shrubland. A taxonomic description of the new species, including images and a distribution map, is provided. The new species is integrated into the most recently published key to Persoonia species.

N2  - The two new species described here are similar to Tetratheca setigera Endl. in having the upper part of the pedicel, the receptacle and the calyx segments densely ornamented with long, red, glandular setae. Tetratheca exasperata R.Butcher differs most readily from T. setigera in its almost glabrous leaves, with strongly revolute margins, and very short, patent stem hairs. This taxon has been infrequently collected from three areas in the Jarrah Forest and Avon Wheatbelt regions and has a Priority Three conservation listing. Tetratheca phoenix R.Butcher differs from T. setigera in its almost glabrous, but prominently tuberculate, stems and densely glandular-hairy ovary. This taxon is restricted to Mt Cooke, c. 70 km south-east of Perth and has a Priority Two conservation listing. These two new species are described and illustrated here, and their distributions are mapped.

This new species has morphological affinity to the rare Wongan Hills triggerplant S. coroniforme F.L.Erickson &amp; J.H.Willis, but has a distinct stigma, a different pattern of corolla markings and is genetically distinct. A revised description of S. coroniforme is provided and S. coroniforme subsp. amblyphyllum Wege, a new infraspecific taxon with distinctive leaves and a distribution near Quairading, is recognised. These three taxa are among the most geographically restricted within the triggerplant genus and all are vulnerable to local extinction.

N2  - The Banded Iron Formation (BIF) ranges are small, ancient ranges scattered across the Yilgarn Craton in southern Western Australia. Increased exploration and mining of iron ore in Western Australia has resulted in a resurgence of botanical survey on and around the BIF ranges, including the discovery of at least 20 unnamed taxa, nine of which were new to science. Recent taxonomic work, published in this special edition of Nuytsia, has concentrated on naming 17 taxa with distributions centred on these ranges and a further 62 taxa of conservation significance in the southern half of Western Australia. Despite this increase in activity, the conservation status of the flora and vegetation remains poorly documented. Patterns in distribution of threatened, rare and poorly known taxa (Declared Rare Flora and Priority Flora) and patterns in endemism are examined on a subset of the 25 ranges most prospective for mining. Preliminary analysis of endemism supports the hypotheses that these ranges represent both refugial habitats of great antiquity and areas of recent speciation. Across Western Australia there are some 2,240 taxa under consideration for formal listing by the Department of Environment and Conservation as threatened; of these, 475 are yet to be formally named. This situation significantly impedes their conservation assessment.

Mueller placed the name in synonymy under T. virgata Steetz in 1882, but Thompson recognised and lectotypified the name in 1976, reiterating the close affinity with T. nuda but querying the status of the taxon. The taxon was known only from the type material until a 2005 collection from near Toodyay was confirmed as comparable with the type. Additional collections have since confirmed its distinctness from T. nuda. This taxon is described in full herein as T. spartea (Benth.) R.Butcher.

N2  - Acacia diallaga Maslin &amp; Buscumb, a new species of Acacia sect.Juliflorae (Benth.) C.Moore &amp; Betche restricted to a small area east of Morawa in the Midwest Region of Western Australia is described. A feature of the new species (and one from which the botanical name is derived) is that during times of drought the phyllodes turn a purplish colour, reverting to their normal glaucous to sub-glaucous colour when conditions improve. This process of foliage colour change related to weather conditions occurs also in A. subsessilis A.R.Chapman &amp; Maslin which is the closest relative of A. diallaga. The new species is listed as a Priority Two species according to the Department of Environment and Conservationâ€™s Conservation Codes for Western Australian Flora.

N2  - In a paper commenting on the generic status of the Chenopodiaceae, Wilson (1987) noted an affinity between the representatives of Chenopodium L. subg. Ambrosia A.J.Scott and the genus Dysphania R.Br., based on the presence of both septate and glandular hairs as well as similarities in leaf shape, leaf venation, inflorescence structure and seed orientation. Mosyakin and Clemants (2002) later came to a similar conclusion and reassigned the North American representatives (both endemic and naturalised) of Chenopodium subg. Ambrosia to Dysphania.

N2  - Thysanotus unicupensis is described as a new species from south-west Western Australia. This species shows some affinities to T. chinensis, T. formosus and T.parviflorus and is apparently localised on lateritic soils in moderately sunny areas within Jarrah/ Marri (Eucalyptus marginata/Corymbia calophylla) woodlands. The key published in Flora of Australia (1987) is amended to include the new species.

N2  - Two new and geographically restricted species allied to H. hamulosa J.R.Wheeler and H. mucronata (Turcz.) Benth. are newly described. Hibbertia abyssa Wege &amp; K.R.Thiele is distinctive for its long, slender and more or less glabrous peduncles, and sepals with both uncinate and minute stellate hairs on the outer surface. This species, which occurs on shallow soils with siltstone outcropping, is known from a single population adjacent to the nickel mine on Bandalup Hill and has recently been gazetted as Declared Rare Flora. Hibbertia atrichosepala Wege &amp; K.R.Thiele is readily distinguished from allied species by its completely glabrous sepals. It is a narrow range endemic of rocky, lateritic habitats in in the Ravensthorpe Range and is listed as having Priority One conservation status.

N2  - Marianthus aquilonaris N.Gibson &amp; Wege, a new species allied to M. mollis (E.M.Benn.) L.Cayzer &amp; Crisp, is described. Morphometric analysis shows that it is most readily differentiated from M. mollis by its higher leaf L:W ratio, higher petal L:W ratio and longer petioles. Other distinguishing features include a more erect habit, smooth and more or less glabrous leaves with attenuate rather than rounded bases , fewer pilose hairs on the stems, peduncles and fruit, and paler petals. Descriptions of both taxa are provided and include the first record of glandular trichomes for the genus. Marianthus aquilonaris is endemic to the Bremer Range and potentially threatened by mining-related activities. It is gazetted as Declared Rare Flora in Western Australia under the name M. sp.

N2  - Lysinema ciliatum has long been regarded as a widespread and variable species. Occurring throughout much of the South-West Botanical Province of Western Australia on a variety of substrates, it is morphologically variable in foliar and floral characters, with up to eleven morphotypes informally recognised as putatively distinct taxa following a preliminary assessment in the early 1990s. Examination of material from throughout the species&rsquo; range shows that most of the currently recognised informal morphotypes comprise a single, variable species which cannot be adequately divided into taxa. A second, distinct species is restricted to the south coast of Western Australia, approximately between Albany and Esperance, with a disjunct outlier east of Perth. Comparison with types shows that the correct name for the widespread taxon is Lysinema pentapetalum R.Br., while the mostly southern-coastal taxon matches the type of L. ciliatum. Descriptions and distribution maps are provided for these taxa, and a key to all species of Lysinema provided.

The new combination P. giganteus (Cunn. ex Moq.) R. W.Davis &amp; R.Butcher is erected for this taxon. With these changes, P. polystachyus is now regarded as a widespread and variable species without infraspecific taxa. Revised descriptions are presented for these two species.

He cited Verreauxia dyeri E.Pritzel ex Hemsley as a synonym. The name V. villosa is current on FloraBase . In 2005, when checking the holdings of this species at Kew for imaging early Australian collections for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility/ Australian Virtual Herbarium project, I found that the second of these names seems to be correct as its publication predates that of the former by just a few weeks. A typographical error in a date of publication apparently led to the previous interpretation.

N2  - This paper evaluated current infraspecific taxa within Ptilotus stirlingii (Lindl.) F.Muell. using morphometric analysis. We conclude that var. pumilus Benl should no longer be recognised as a distinct variety from var. stirlingii and that var. laxus (Benth.) Benl and var. minutus Benl should be merged into a single taxon. The new name P. stirlingii subsp. australis R.W.Davis &amp; R.Butcher is erected for this taxon and var. stirlingii is elevated in rank. With these changes, P. stirlingii now comprises two subspecies rather than four varieties. Revised descriptions and a key are presented for the new subspecies.

N2  - Tetratheca sp. Mt Solus (F. Obbens 307/98) was collected once from Mt Solus, in the Darling Range, in November 1998 but has never been relocated. This taxon was distinguished from T. affinis Endl. by its possession of only one ovule per loculus, compared with four or five ovules per loculus, as well as its geographic disjunction. Close examination of all specimens of T. affinis at PERTH has found that ovule number per loculus varies from one to five, and that Tetratheca sp. Mt Solus (F. Obbens 307/ 98) does not have any unique morphological features supporting its distinction from T. affinis. By contrast,three specimens of T. affinis from near Cape Riche were found to have a suite of subtle differences from typical T. affinis and have been placed on the Western Australian Plant Census as T. affinis subsp. Cape Riche (T.D. Macfarlane TDM 1832) pending further fieldwork and taxonomic study.

N2  - Hypocalymma (Endl.) Endl. was first described as a section of Leptospermum J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst. and shortly afterwards raised to the generic level (Endlicher 1837, Endlicher 1840). It was based on the two species now known as H. angustifolium (Endl.) Schauer and H. robustum  (Endl.) Lindl. In their recent review of the genus, Strid and Keighery (2002) recorded H. angustifolium as the type species, but they did not lectotypify it nor refer to any previous lectotypification. As H. robustum  appears to be a better match for the protologue, that species is selected here as the lectotype.

N2  - A taxonomic revision of the highly diverse Western Australian Mulga flora (Acacia aneura F.Muell. ex Benth. and its close relatives) is presented, based on morphological analyses of almost 2000 herbarium collections complemented by field studies of about 300 populations (mostly located in Western Australia, with a few from the Northern Territory and South Australia). Twelve species accommodated in three informal groups, the Blue, Grey-green and Green Alliances, are recognised. Almost all of the species contain informal variants, and putative hybrids and/or intergrades are common. Because many of the species had previously been recognised as varieties of A. aneura  (Pedley 2001) a discussion of our taxon concepts is given. The 12 species are defined by a combination of morphological characters, the most important being branchlet resin (translucent vs opaque) and pod margins (rimmed, bevel-edged or winged), complemented by new shoot (resinous vs non-resinous), phyllode (shape, size, curvature, nervature) and pod (width) attributes. A discussion of the taxonomically most informative characters in the Mulga group is presented. Seven new species are recognised: Acacia&nbsp;aptaneura Maslin &amp; J.E.Reid (syn. A. aneura var. pilbarana Pedley and A.&nbsp;aneura  var. tenuis Pedley), A. caesaneura Maslin &amp; J.E.Reid (syn. A. aneura var.&nbsp;argentea Pedley), A. fuscaneura Maslin &amp; J.E.Reid (syn. A. aneura var. fuliginea Pedley), A.&nbsp;incurvaneura Maslin &amp; J.E.Reid (syn. A. aneura var. microcarpa Pedley), A. macraneura Maslin &amp; J.E.Reid (syn. A. aneura var. macrocarpa Randell), A.&nbsp; mulganeura Maslin &amp; J.E.Reid and A. pteraneura Maslin &amp; J.E.Reid. Acacia aneura var. intermedia Pedley is provisionally regarded as conspecific with the broadly circumscribed A. aneura.

N2  - Stackhousia stratfordii W.R.Barker &amp; Cockerton sp. nov. possesses attributes unique to its genus and subfamily of opposite sub-radical leaves and flowers borne in scapes and containing three stamens. Morphological evidence is summarised arguing its placement within Stackhousia . The Stackhousioideae Burnett are a subfamily distinctive in Celastraceae R.Br. for their herbaceous life-form, mainly moth-pollinated, tubular flowers, and fruits that are single-seeded indehiscent mericarps (cocci) (Barker 1983, 1984, in press); in terms of diversity they are centred in Australia, occurring in much of the continent, in temperate arid, semi-arid and sub-tropical regions. Until recently a separate family (Stackhousiaceae R.Br.), the subfamily has morphological and geographic features unique in the family Celastraceae, in which they have been placed in the last decade (Kubitzki 2004a, b; Simmons 2004 a, b). It comprises three genera: Tripterococcus Endl. with three species , confined to south-west Western Australia, Macgregoria F.Muell., a single species spread across the southern half of arid Australia, and Stackhousia Sm. with over 30 species spread over the geographical and climatic range of the subfamily in Australia, with a single species in New Zealand and another spread into Malesia, the Philippines and Micronesia (Barker, in press).

N2  - This paper reports for the first time the introduction into Western Australia from the northern hemisphere of Inocybe curvipes P.Karst. and Inocybe rufuloides Bon. The fungi are associated with planted non&ndash; native ectomycorrhizal trees &ndash; Quercus, Pinus, and possibly Salix. Previously, I. curvipes was confirmed from South Australia where it has been present for at least almost a century, but it was not known from Western Australia. I. rufuloides had not been recorded anywhere in Australia. In this paper I. curvipes is also reported for the first time in Papua New Guinea, in association with planted Quercus and Pinus. Populus and Quercus are confirmed as ectomycorrhizal partners of I. curvipes based on ITS BLASTn analysis of environmental sequences.

N2  - Amanita ochroterrea (Gentilli) Bas and A. brunneiphylla O.K.Miller are robust, macroscopically similar mushrooms described from the southwest of Western Australia. According to the protologue of A. brunneiphylla, the main difference between them is the presence (in A. ochroterrea) or absence (in A. brunneiphylla) of clamp connections. However in the current study abundant clamp connections have been observed in the holotype and paratypes of A.&nbsp;brunneiphylla. As other microscopic characters are indistinguishable, A. brunneiphylla is synonymised with A.&nbsp;ochroterrea, and an expanded description presented.

Inocybe fulvilubrica has nodulose spores, a yellowish brown pileus that may be viscid or greasy and bears patches of white velar material, and a white pruinose stipe with a marginate bulb. Inocybe redolens is distinguished by the combination of nodulose spores, a squamulose disc, lack of caulocystidia, and an odour of Pelargonium. Inocybe sinuospora Matheny &amp; Bougher known only from southwest Western Australia, has distinctive oblong- angular spores with a sinuous outline. Inocybe torresiae Matheny, Bougher &amp; M.D.Barrett is a tropical species with nodulose spores described from forests in northern Western Australia and Queensland. It is distinguished by its truncate or sessile hymenial cystidia, presence of caulocystidia, and sweet or citrine odour.

N2  - Acacia&nbsp;aneura F.Muell. ex Benth. is a member of a large, taxonomically complex group of plants that are very common in the Australian arid zone. In order to help determine the application of this name the type collection of A.&nbsp;aneura at the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL) is reassessed after visits to the type locality. This collection comprises rather fragmentary specimens mounted on three sheets (MEL 724215, 724218 and 724219), each labelled as having been collected [in 1851] by Ferdinand von Mueller from &lsquo;Cudnaka&rsquo;. This locality is now known as Kanyaka, located in the South Flinders Ranges, South Australia, between Quorn and Hawker. The holotype is confirmed as the depauperate fruiting specimen on MEL 724218. The fertile specimen on MEL 724219 is confirmed as belonging to a Mulga taxon of uncertain status and is not a type. The sterile specimen on MEL 724215 and the sterile specimens on MEL 724219 may or may not be types, but their status cannot be determined with any certainty. The populations at Kanyaka that Mueller presumably visited were sampled by the authors in 2007, 2008 and 2010. Subsequent study showed there to be two distinct Mulga morphotypes in these populations. One morphotype corresponds to the type of A. aneura but the status of the second morphotype is uncertain. The latter does not match the fertile specimen on MEL 724219 and appears not to have been collected by Mueller; it may possibly represent a hitherto undescribed species. The taxonomic status of the first morphotype, and hence the application of the name A. aneura, is currently uncertain. Further field, morphological and genetic studies, especially of South Australian populations, are needed to resolve the application of the name A. aneura and also to establish the status of the second morphotype collected from the type locality.

N2  -  Mirbelia balsiformis R.Butcher, M.&nbsp;corallina  R.Butcher and M.&nbsp;ferricola R.Butcher are described herein as new species allied to the &lsquo;M.&nbsp;viminalis group&rsquo; Of the newly described species, M.&nbsp;balsiformis is widely distributed between Kalbarri and Shark Bay, and is not conservation-listed, while M.&nbsp;corallina and M.&nbsp;ferricola are listed as Priority Three conservation taxa in Western Australia. Mirbelia corallina  is restricted to sandplains in the Kalbarri area, with most collections from Kalbarri National Park. Mirbelia ferricola is restricted to Banded Iron Formation ranges between the Koolanooka Hills, east of Morawa, and the Bremer Range, west of Norseman. Although this species has a wide area of occupancy, the biodiverse ranges on which it occurs are small, disjunct islands in an otherwise subdued landscape, and are highly prospective for mining. The putative taxon M. sp. Carnarvon (J.S. Beard 6008), previously poorly defined, appears to be a recognisable variant within the variable M.&nbsp; ramulosa (Benth.) C.A.Gardner. The name is retained on Western Australia &rsquo;s plant census, however, until its status can be clarified by a comprehensive study of variation in M.&nbsp;ramulosa across its range. This paper describes, illustrates and provides distribution maps for M.&nbsp;balsiformis, M.&nbsp;corallina and M.&nbsp; ferricola, and distinguishes them from similar, scale-leaved Mirbelia Sm. species in Western Australia. A key to species of the &lsquo;M.&nbsp; viminalis group&rsquo; is also provided.

Tetratheca spenceri is currently known from a single population on a laterite outcrop south-east of Coolgardie and is of conservation significance. Five rare, short-range endemic Tetratheca taxa are already known from Banded Iron Formation ranges in the Coolgardie bioregion. Tetratheca spenceri can be distinguished from all other species of Tetratheca in the region by its combination of straight, finely wrinkled, glaucous stems, alternate, appressed, narrowly deltoid scale-leaves, moderately long peduncles bearing long, glandular hairs, uniformly pink petals, two ovules per locule, which are crowded together near the apex of the septum, and narrowly obovate, glabrous fruit. The new species is described and illustrated herein, its affinities are discussed, and its distribution mapped. A key to the 'leafless' taxa of Tetratheca in Western Australia is included.

N2  - The type gathering of Banksia plumosa (R.Br.) A.R.Mast &amp; K.R.Thiele was collected by Robert Brown from Bay 1 (Lucky Bay, c. 35 km east of Esperance) in January 1802 (Figure 1). Over the following two centuries, further collections of this species have been made in an area from the Stirling Range and Albany eastwards to the Fitzgerald River (Western Australian Herbarium 1998&ndash;). However, B.&nbsp;plumosa has not been recorded again from any area east of Bremer Bay. George (1999) concluded that the type locality was in error, and that the more likely type location was in the Albany district (King George Sound), where Brown collected from late December 1801 to early January 1802 (Vallance et al. 1993).

N2  - A new, rare species, Atalaya brevialata Cowie &amp; G.M. Wightman is described and illustrated. The species is unusual in the genus in having a greatly reduced wing on the samara and the suffruticose growth habit, the latter perhaps an adaption to the region&rsquo;s wet-dry tropical climate and prevailing near-annual fire regime. It appears to have a restricted distribution to the south of Darwin and its conservation status is evaluated. A key to species of Atalaya Blume in the Northern Territory and Western Australia is provided.

N2  - While curating the Ptilotus R.Br. collection at the Western Australian Herbarium, I came across a small line drawing of the Presumed Extinct species P. pyramidatus (Moq.) F.Muell. This name is based on a Drummond collection of unknown provenance. It was immediately clear from the habit depicted that it could represent an earlier name for the recently published P. christineae R.W.Davis &amp; Tauss. Subsequent examination of type material confirmed that P. pyramidatus is conspecific with P. christineae and the latter name must therefore be reduced to synonymy. The specimens collected in Perth in late 2010, which formed the basis for the description of P. christineae, represent the first collections of P. pyramidatus for more than 160 years.

N2  - The generic limits of Wedelia Jacq., Melanthera Rohr, and Wollastonia DC. ex Decne., as currently recognised, are re-examined on the basis of comparative morphology, and a new classification recognising the first two genera in a restricted sense is proposed, with other taxa redistributed through nine genera. In this classification, Wedelia (including Aspilia Thouars) with c. 100 species, is restricted to the Americas and Africa. Melanthera is restricted to c. five species of the Caribbean basin and northern Andes. It is proposed that African species formerly in Melanthera be transferred to Lipotriche R.Br. and the following new combinations are made: L. scandens (Schum. &amp; Thonn.) Orchard; L. scandens subsp. subsimplicifolia (Wild) Orchard; L. scandens subsp. dregei (DC.) Orchard; L. triternata (Klatt) Orchard; L. abyssinica (Sch.Bip. ex Rich.) Orchard; L. gambica (Hutch. &amp; Dalziel) Orchard; L. pungens (Oliver &amp; Hiern.) Orchard. The autonym L. scandens subsp. scandens is newly created. Echinocephalum Gardner of South America is resurrected, with a single species (E. latifolium Gardner). It is proposed that Wollastonia be retained as a genus distinct from Wedelia, Melanthera and Lipochaeta DC., with which it has been variously synonymised by recent authors. In Australia two species of Wollastonia are recognised, W. biflora (L.) DC. and W. uniflora (Willd.) Orchard. These species are keyed, described and illustrated. The Hawai&lsquo;ian species of Lipochaeta sect. Aphanopappus (Endl.) Benth. &amp; Hook.f. are transferred to Wollastonia, and placement of Wollastonia lifuana (Hochr.) Fosb. of New Caledonia and Vanuatu, and the Asian species Wedelia prostrata Hemsl. in Wollastonia (as Wollastonia dentata) is confirmed. New combinations are made for Wollastonia biflora var. ryukyuensis (H.Koyama) Orchard, W. bryanii (Sherff) Orchard, W. dentata (H.L&eacute;v. &amp; Vaniot) Orchard, W. fauriei (H.L&eacute;v.) Orchard, W. integrifolia (Nutt.) Orchard, W. kamolensis (O.Deg. &amp; Sherff) Orchard, W. lavarum (Gaudich.) Orchard, W. micrantha (Nutt.)

Orchard. The autonym W. micrantha subsp. micrantha is newly created. Lipochaeta DC. in Hawai&lsquo;i is restricted to the species with 4-lobed disc floret corollas, formerly treated as Lipochaeta sect. Lipochaeta. The Australian and New Guinean species formerly placed in Wedelia are transferred to two new genera: Apowollastonia Orchard, with eight species, including four new combinations (A. longipes (Klatt) Orchard, A. spilanthoides (F.Muell.) Orchard, A. stirlingii (Tate) Orchard and A. verbesinoides (Benth.) Orchard) and five new taxa (A. cylindrica Orchard, A. hamersleyensis Orchard, A. hibernica Orchard, A. major Orchard and A. stirlingii subsp. fontaliciana Orchard). The autonym A. stirlingii subsp. stirlingii is newly created, as is the genus Acunniana Orchard, with one species (A. procumbens (DC.) Orchard). In Malesia/Asia, two monotypic new genera are proposed, Indocypraea Orchard (with a single species, I. montana (Blume) Orchard, formerly Wedelia (Wollastonia) montana), and Quadribractea Orchard (with a single species, Q. moluccana (Blume) Orchard, formerly Wedelia moluccana). Five species related to the former Wedelia urticifolia (Blume) DC. are transferred to the new genus Lipoblepharis Orchard (L. urticifolia (Blume) Orchard, with two subspecies L. urticifolia subsp. urticifolia and subsp. hortorum Orchard, L. thailandica (Koyama) Orchard, L. asperrima (Decne.) Orchard, L. stenophylla (Merr.) Orchard and L. floribunda Orchard). Lectotypes are chosen for Verbesina urticifolia Blume, V. moluccana Blume, V. montana Blume, Buphthalmum australe Biehler (&equiv; Buphthalmum helianthoides sensu Forster), Wedelia spilanthoides F.Muell., Wedelia verbesinoides Benth. and Wedelia stirlingii Tate.

N2  - Two Western Australian species currently referred to the genus Ozothamnus R.Br. have in the past been considered poorly aligned with that genus, but their alternative placement has been uncertain. Recent molecular studies have suggested that they are best placed in the Western Australian endemic genus Pithocarpa Lindl. The following new combinations are made: Pithocarpa cordata (DC.) Schmidt-Leb. &amp; R.L.Barrett and Pithocarpa ramosa (DC.) Schmidt-Leb. &amp; R.L.Barrett. Four species are now recognised in Pithocarpa and all are listed here.

N2  - Most members of the south-western Australian genus Hypocalymma (Endl.) Endl. have seeds with a shallowly to very deeply pitted testa. Two small groups of species, both revised here, differ in having a smooth or colliculate testa. Both groups occur in humid environments in the extreme south-west of Western Australia and show vegetative adaptations consistent with this habitat preference. The larger group, Hypocalymma sect. Cardiomyrtus Schauer, is reinstated. A new combination, H. minus (Strid &amp; Keighery) Keighery, is made, bringing the total species recognised to five, and lectotypes are selected for two synonyms, H. boroniaceum F.Muell. ex Benth. and H. hypericifolium Benth. The other group is extremely rare, consisting of the possibly extinct species H. connatum Strid &amp; Keighery, and a new species known from a single population, H. verticillare Rye. The latter group, named here as Hypocalymma sect. Verticilla Rye, is readily disitinguished by its 3-ridged young stems and consistently whorled leaves, and the new species is unusual in having extreme differences in the sizes of the anthers on different stamens within each flower. Molecular data indicate that sect. Verticilla is sister to sect. Cardiomyrtus. Evidence of taxonomic relationships is also presented from studies of hybridisation and insect associations.

N2  - Hemigenia rigida Benth. (sect.

Hemigenia pritzelii S.Moore (also sect. Homalochilus), a more frequent species from the Jarrah Forest of south-west Western Australia, has been frequently confused with H. rigida and both were previously confused with H. ramosissima Benth. The mis-application of the name H. rigida to the distinct and more abundant species H. pritzelii has hampered recognition of the potentially dire conservation status of H. rigida. To resolve longstanding confusion, distinguishing characters are provided for H. pritzelii and H. rigida along with morphological descriptions, distribution maps and information on ecology. An interim key to the species of sect. Homalochilus is presented for context and to aid identification.

N2  - Three species of Amanita Pers. are documented from Western Australia. Amanita lesueurii E.M.Davison is described from the mid-west region. It is distinguished by its small to medium fruiting bodies with a white pileus and white universal veil (both of which become vinaceous-buff or grey with age), white gills, short white stipe with a small obconic or turbinate bulb, white partial veil, amyloid, elongate to cylindrical spores, and no clamp connections. Amanita wadjukiorum E.M.Davison is described from the Perth metropolitan area. It has medium to large fruiting bodies with a cream pileus that ages milky coffee to snuff brown, a pale grey or buff universal veil that ages hazel to drab, cream gills, grey to buff stipe with a napiform or fusiform bulb, white to cream to vinaceous-buff partial veil that disappears with age, amyloid, ellipsoid to elongate spores and no clamp connections. Amanita fibrillopes O.K.Mill., which was previously only known from the type locality, is a widespread but misidentified species. It has small to large fruiting bodies with a pale peach to pale salmon pileus that rapidly ages cream, a white universal veil that rapidly ages buff or milky coffee, white gills that age buff, white or pale pink stipe with a spherical or obconic or tapered bulb, white or buff apical partial veil that disappears with age, inamyloid, ellipsoid to elongate spores and no clamp connections. A BLASTn search has shown that there are no exact matches of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of each species with those in GenBank.

Notes are provided on A. gracillima Tindale (Acacia sect. Juliflorae) which provisionally includes a poorly known, distinctive entity in need of further taxonomic scrutiny. Except for A. claviseta, which extends to the Northern Territory, the new species are endemic to the Kimberley region. Eleven of the new species (all except A. camptocarpa and A. claviseta) are endemic to the high-rainfall area of the north-west Kimberley, highlighting significant levels of plant endemism in this region. A number of these species are geographically restricted (three are known only from the type) and all except A. prolata are treated as Priority taxa under the Department of Parks and Wildlife&rsquo;s Conservation Codes for Western Australian Flora. Most of the new species are killed by fire and their distributions are restricted to rocky, presumably naturally fire-limiting sites.

N2  - Taxonomic review of the Drosera indica L. (Droseraceae) complex requires the clarification of a number of published names. This paper is focussed on the application of names applying to taxa occurring in Australia. Two lectotypes are chosen and one neotype is designated for names historically listed as synonyms of D. indica. Drosera serpens Planch. and D. angustifolia F.Muell. are lectotypified. A neotype is selected for D. hexagynia Blanco as no original material is known. Drosera hexagynia is considered to be a synonym of D. indica. Drosera angustifolia and D. indica f. robusta F.M.Bailey are here considered to be synonyms of D. finlaysoniana Wall. ex. Arn. Drosera angustifolia var. purpuriflora F.Muell. ex Diels is an illegitimate name. Notes are provided on D. hartmeyerorum Schlauer, the only other named Australian taxon in this species complex. Characteristics of the seeds, anthers and glandular hairs are considered diagnostic at the species level. Illustrations of key identifying features and full descriptions of the Australian species are provided.

N2  - Dipteracanthus chichesterensis Trudgen &amp; de Kock is described as a new species of Acanthaceae (tribe Ruellieae Dumort.) restricted to the Chichester Plateau in the Pilbara bioregion of Western Australia. The new species is known from five localities and is considered poorly known and of conservation significance. It is most closely related to D. australasicus F.Muell., differing in stem and leaf indumentum, pollen ornamentation and seed characteristics. A distribution map, photographs and a key to Dipteracanthus Nees taxa currently recognised in Western Australia are provided.

N2  - This taxonomic review of Stylidium sect. Junceae Mildbr. recognises eight species endemic to south-western Western Australia and presents a new circumscription for S. junceum R.Br., the original description of which was based on a mixed gathering comprising three distinct taxa. A lectotype is designated in order to fix the application of the name S. junceum to one of these, a species with a diminutive habit, pale creamy yellow to apricot-pink corolla lobes, and a column morphology that is unique within the genus. A neotype is designated for S. junceum subsp. brevius (E.Pritz.) Carlquist, which is not recognised as distinct. Stylidium scariosum DC. is reinstated and S. hesperium Wege, S. hygrophilum Wege, S. paludicola Wege and S. thryonides Wege described as new. Revised descriptions are provided for S. squamosotuberosum Carlquist and S. laciniatum C.A.Gardner, with S. junceum var. volubile F.Muell. lectotypified and placed into synonymy under the latter species. Descriptions, distribution maps, illustrations and photographs are supplied for each species, and an identification key provided. Stylidium hygrophilum has a highly localised distribution on the Blackwood Plateau south of Busselton and may warrant listing as Threatened. Stylidium paludicola, a species confined to swamps on the Swan Coastal Plain, is also listed as being of conservation concern, with targeted surveys required to better understand its conservation status.

Acacia dilloniorum occurs in the adjacent Eremaean Botanical Province, in the south-west extremity of the arid zone; it is most closely related to A. kochii W.Fitzg. ex Ewart &amp; Jean White and is not especially close to the other three new species described here.

Acacia haematites occurs on the Koolyanobbing Range (close to the township of Koolyanobbing) while A. shapelleae occurs on the Helena and Aurora Range which is located about 40 km to the north of Koolyanobbing. Both these geographically restricted species occur in areas of mining interests and are therefore classified as Priority One under Department of Parks and Wildlife Conservation Codes for Western Australian Flora. The two new species belong to Acacia sect. Acacia and are allopatric with respect to their closest relatives (A. acuaria W.Fitzg. and A. glutinosissima Maiden &amp; Blakely respectively) which are reasonably widespread in the central and northern wheatbelt region of the South West Botanical Province.

N2  - Two subspecies are here recognised in the geographically rare and taxonomically isolated Eucalyptus insularis Brooker. Eucalyptus insularis subsp. insularis is known only from North Twin Peak Island in the Recherche Archipelago, about 90 km east-south-east of Esperance. Eucalyptus insularis subsp. continentalis D.Nicolle &amp; Brooker subsp. nov. is known only from several small populations near Cape Le Grand on the mainland, about 25 km south-east of Esperance, and differs from the type subspecies in its low shrubby habit, smaller adult leaves with obscure tertiary venation and irregularly-shaped oil glands, more strongly pendulous inflorescences, and its generally smaller buds and fruits.

N2  - Three species of Amanita Pers. are documented from Western Australia. Amanita drummondii E.M.Davison is described from the south-west region; it appears to be widespread but infrequent. Amanita quenda E.M.Davison is described from the Perth Metropolitan area. Amanita walpolei O.K.Mill. is redescribed to include additional collections, drawing attention to the presence of clamp connections in all tissues. A BLASTn search has shown that there are no exact matches of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of each species with those in GenBank.

N2  - The south-western Australian genus Ericomyrtus Turcz. is reinstated as a small genus comprising the type species E. drummondii Turcz., and three species transferred into the genus as E. parvifolia (Turcz.) Rye, E. serpyllifolia (Turcz.) Rye and E. tenuior (Ewart) Rye. A lectotype is selected for the base name of the last of those species, Baeckea crispiflora var. tenuior Ewart. It appears that the genus has a tetraploid base number of x = 22. Maps, descriptions and a key are provided for the four named members of the genus.
